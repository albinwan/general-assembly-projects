,gainit,"Hey guys. I've been bulking for the last 2 years straight and have went from mid 160s to between 187-194 lbs. I want to keep this weight as I am a part of my university's powerlifting club and 1) don't want to drop a weight class 2) want to maintain relative strength gains. I, however will be gone for an extended drill with my guard unit for 13 days and for a whole month in the summer for a seperate drill. In total, I would roughly get 3,500 calories in per day. With an already active schedule, I need to take in roughly 4,190 cals a day to maintain my current bodyweight. While on an FTX, I'll need to consume 4,200+ cals to maintain weight. Because of this, I was wondering if any of you know about bottled drinks I could take with me so I can maintain my daily calorie intake. Preferably, the bottled beverages you all might recommend have some protein in them. Thanks in advance. Sorry for the obscure, extremely specific post. I'm genuinely concerned about losing all the recent progress I've made. I'm starting to get close to qualifying for nationals in my weight class and I don't want the army to ruin yet again another thing that brings me joy.

I&amp;#39;ve been bulking for the last 2 years straight and have went from mid 160s to between 187-194 lbs. I want to keep this weight as I am a part of my university&amp;#39;s powerlifting club and 1) don&amp;#39;t want to drop a weight class 2) want to maintain relative strength gains. I, however will be gone for an extended drill with my guard unit for 13 days and for a whole month in the summer for a seperate drill. In total, I would roughly get 3,500 calories in per day. With an already active schedule, I need to take in roughly 4,190 cals a day to maintain my current bodyweight. While on an FTX, I&amp;#39;ll need to consume 4,200+ cals to maintain weight. Because of this, I was wondering if any of you know about bottled drinks I could take with me so I can maintain my daily calorie intake. Preferably, the bottled beverages you all might recommend have some protein in them. Thanks in advance. Sorry for the obscure, extremely specific post. I&amp;#39;m genuinely concerned about losing all the recent progress I&amp;#39;ve made. I&amp;#39;m starting to get close to qualifying for nationals in my weight class and I don&amp;#39;t want the army to ruin yet again another thing that brings me joy.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of my excess fat is localized in my love handles. It's really not a lot and I look skinny in clothes but I just want to be more muscular.

Age: 20, Sex: Male, Height: 5'10, Weight: 135-138 lbs, natural

Experience: Started seriously working out since September 2020, stopped between November till end of Jan due to personal issues. Restarted in Feb in a proper gym and have good form in main lifts such as Bench, OHP, Squart, and DL. In my 3 months or so of serious training I have gained significant progress and people have noted my size difference.

Main goals: Increase size and strength. Mix of hypertrophy and strength. But mostly appreciate aesthetics.

Current Maxes:

Bench: 125 lbs for 3 reps ( can be done for about 3 sets given 2 warmup sets and 2 sets of 115 lbs)

Deadlift: 145 lbs. Can continue to increase, not sure where my limit is but slowly increasing to avoid injury

Squat: 135 lbs. Slowly increasing, can do 3 set of 7 reps given warmup sets and others

Overhead Press: 75 lbs, slowly increasing. Can do 4 sets of 5 with prior warmup

Question regarding LM Bulking Routine:

1. I understand the exercises that are on the program, but I was wondering whether I can modify it to fit my 6 days a week workout schedule. I am also unsure about what weight to use for the workout and how to increase. For example, what should I start with now and how much should I increase per week?
2. I noticed there aren't any ab exercises in this program. I therefore assigned Wednesday's rest day as the designated abs day
3. Stiffleg deadlifts vs regular deadlifts?
4. Any app recommendations to store this program on? I am currently using the Gymshark app. But would appreciate maybe an app that contains a ""weeks"" function and another function that alters your set weights based on new max PRs.

,gainit,"From August 2019-September 2020 I did little to no consistent training. I went from 230ish to 170 at my lowest. Coming back to training was really hard, and I sympathize with you if you are restarting after losing everything. I want you to know that although you may  THINK have lost all of your muscle and strength gains, they are still there just laying dormant. Years of training results in additional satellite cells being created and etched into your muscles that stick around for *decades*. 

I was 175 when I started back up. The first time I came back to the gym, I was warming up to squat and [fell backwards on my ass almost every set.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEIRK8uA7i-/?igshid=13gd8vqnv96wb) I was so mad at myself and my body. I knew how to squat in my mind, but my body just didn't have the skill anymore, it had to be redeveloped. I wasn't even as close to upset at how little weight I could move compared to actually not being able to squat. Be nice to yourself when you come back, you know how to do it, but you need to be patient with your body as it relearns. 

It has been 6ish months since I have returned to lifting and I have already set lifetime PRs and gained all of the weight I lost back. In fact, I am 245 now and that is also a lifetime PR. Here is what I did the first 2 and half months and my advice for returning to the gym:

**DO NOT test your maxes**

After I realized my body lost a ton of motor patterns, I was so upset, it is such a bad feeling. On top of that, I knew I was weak. To help protect my ego, I refused to learn my maxes on lifts, it would only cause more harm to me mentally. Ignorance is definitely bliss when you're starting again from scratch, and you have no business pushing yourself to the max at this point. You will thank yourself for choosing to ignore the truth at this time later down the road, I promise.

**Accumulate work capacity**

This should be your number one priority. Your tolerance for work capacity has dropped so far down and you need to ease back into it. Go very slow! Do not jump in the deep end right away, you have no business running a 6 day routine with 5-7 exercises a day, 2 exercises a day and some light conditioning will take you far at this stage. 

**Focus on practicing**

Those motor patterns that are 'gone' are still there, just dormant. You cannot force or rush this phase, it is a process. Focus each training session around a compound movement and do not go anywhere close to failure. You should barely be straining at first, your muscles need to relearn the movement and you need to focus on coordination. Trying to build muscle at this point is asinine and not what we are after. Your body is terribly inefficient at moving weight again but will regrow exponentially faster than the first time if you do it the right way. Keeping it light without a ton of volume is perfect, that way you get more practice than muscle damage. 

**High frequency, low intensity low volume per session**

I originally said low volume, but that's really not true on a weekly basis. I lifted everyday, but only did 2 exercises of 4-6 sets of 6-10 reps. This is all you need at first and I promise it will set you up for success. You will not be stuck training like this for long.

**How to pick weights** 

I recommend you read easy strength by dan john, as this had a lot of influence on my returning to training.

This was very simple for me, just pick a weight that used to be your first or second warmup set. It should be extremely light, like lighter than you are probably thinking right now. You can do more with light weight, you can put more force into the bar than required or change the tempo to make it more difficult. F=ma, there I just proved it scientifically. If you choose a weight that's too heavy, not only can you not do these things, but you also don't have room to progress and you might end up missing. 

**How to progress**

The first month I used a very simple double progression model, which is to say you don't increase load until 2 variables are achieved. For example, say my deadlift day starts at 3x6 (which it did). The next session I'd do 4x6. The session after that I'd do 4x8, then 5x8, followed by 5x10. Only after I reached 5x10 on an exercise would I add weight and reset to 3x6. And I usually only added 10lbs each time I reset back to 3x6. The second month, start adding in hard conditioning, hill sprints and 60/120s are my go to and will always be a staple for me. I recommend you go easy on conditioning at first though.

**When to stop and move on**

You'll know you're ready when you are confident enough to test your maxes. 2.5 months back for me was enough. I tested my maxes and about 85% of my strength was back. 

Returning after a layoff can feel daunting and is a dreadful experience, but you will pick up where you left off in a very fast time frame. You'll get those gains back so fast that you'll feel like you're on steroids.

If you're trying to get back into lifting but are just too discouraged after a couple of sessions, please give this a shot and let me know how it goes for you.",t2_fb0wp,False,,0,False,How to come back after a HUGE layoff (~1 year),[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lz6t31,False,dark,0.96,,public,127,4,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,127,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 2},,True,,1615081414.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From August 2019-September 2020 I did little to no consistent training. I went from 230ish to 170 at my lowest. Coming back to training was really hard, and I sympathize with you if you are restarting after losing everything. I want you to know that although you may  THINK have lost all of your muscle and strength gains, they are still there just laying dormant. Years of training results in additional satellite cells being created and etched into your muscles that stick around for &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 175 when I started back up. The first time I came back to the gym, I was warming up to squat and &lt;a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CEIRK8uA7i-/?igshid=13gd8vqnv96wb""&gt;fell backwards on my ass almost every set.&lt;/a&gt; I was so mad at myself and my body. I knew how to squat in my mind, but my body just didn&amp;#39;t have the skill anymore, it had to be redeveloped. I wasn&amp;#39;t even as close to upset at how little weight I could move compared to actually not being able to squat. Be nice to yourself when you come back, you know how to do it, but you need to be patient with your body as it relearns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been 6ish months since I have returned to lifting and I have already set lifetime PRs and gained all of the weight I lost back. In fact, I am 245 now and that is also a lifetime PR. Here is what I did the first 2 and half months and my advice for returning to the gym:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO NOT test your maxes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I realized my body lost a ton of motor patterns, I was so upset, it is such a bad feeling. On top of that, I knew I was weak. To help protect my ego, I refused to learn my maxes on lifts, it would only cause more harm to me mentally. Ignorance is definitely bliss when you&amp;#39;re starting again from scratch, and you have no business pushing yourself to the max at this point. You will thank yourself for choosing to ignore the truth at this time later down the road, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accumulate work capacity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be your number one priority. Your tolerance for work capacity has dropped so far down and you need to ease back into it. Go very slow! Do not jump in the deep end right away, you have no business running a 6 day routine with 5-7 exercises a day, 2 exercises a day and some light conditioning will take you far at this stage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on practicing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those motor patterns that are &amp;#39;gone&amp;#39; are still there, just dormant. You cannot force or rush this phase, it is a process. Focus each training session around a compound movement and do not go anywhere close to failure. You should barely be straining at first, your muscles need to relearn the movement and you need to focus on coordination. Trying to build muscle at this point is asinine and not what we are after. Your body is terribly inefficient at moving weight again but will regrow exponentially faster than the first time if you do it the right way. Keeping it light without a ton of volume is perfect, that way you get more practice than muscle damage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High frequency, low intensity low volume per session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally said low volume, but that&amp;#39;s really not true on a weekly basis. I lifted everyday, but only did 2 exercises of 4-6 sets of 6-10 reps. This is all you need at first and I promise it will set you up for success. You will not be stuck training like this for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pick weights&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you read easy strength by dan john, as this had a lot of influence on my returning to training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was very simple for me, just pick a weight that used to be your first or second warmup set. It should be extremely light, like lighter than you are probably thinking right now. You can do more with light weight, you can put more force into the bar than required or change the tempo to make it more difficult. F=ma, there I just proved it scientifically. If you choose a weight that&amp;#39;s too heavy, not only can you not do these things, but you also don&amp;#39;t have room to progress and you might end up missing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first month I used a very simple double progression model, which is to say you don&amp;#39;t increase load until 2 variables are achieved. For example, say my deadlift day starts at 3x6 (which it did). The next session I&amp;#39;d do 4x6. The session after that I&amp;#39;d do 4x8, then 5x8, followed by 5x10. Only after I reached 5x10 on an exercise would I add weight and reset to 3x6. And I usually only added 10lbs each time I reset back to 3x6. The second month, start adding in hard conditioning, hill sprints and 60/120s are my go to and will always be a staple for me. I recommend you go easy on conditioning at first though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to stop and move on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll know you&amp;#39;re ready when you are confident enough to test your maxes. 2.5 months back for me was enough. I tested my maxes and about 85% of my strength was back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning after a layoff can feel daunting and is a dreadful experience, but you will pick up where you left off in a very fast time frame. You&amp;#39;ll get those gains back so fast that you&amp;#39;ll feel like you&amp;#39;re on steroids. &lt;a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CFA6RWOgKqC/?igshid=pbpl1bae3ogd""&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is only a few months away from &lt;a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CLzvb0sAz87/?igshid=1lsfrtu2ciw55""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. I hope this helps someone, anyone. If you&amp;#39;re trying to get back into lifting but are just too discouraged after a couple of sessions, please give this a shot and let me know how it goes for you.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"So for the first time ever at 21 I decided to go to the gym after my best friends kept begging me to go because I’d feel better about myself and I really do. I love going and slowly seeing myself get stronger and progressively increasing my weight. My friends push me and I feel proud of myself for finally getting out of my comfort zone. 

What I don’t like though is eating. I’ve always been skinny I’m 5”6 at about 120lbs and I rarely have an appetite making it hard to finish my meals.

,gainit,"Hey r/gaintit,

I've been following this subreddit since November and in January, I finally started to do something about my lack of gains. January 1st, I was 150 lbs, and I'm 6'3. I take in roughly 2800-3000 calories a day. I do push/pull/legs twice a week and Sunday is rest day. I now weight 165 lbs and have been seeing some solid gains.

Since starting, I've been able to see results everywhere EXCEPT my chest. My chest feels stronger if I press it but in terms of mass size, it doesn't look any different. I currently do - dumbbell bench press, dumbbell incline bench press, inclined chest flyes and push ups (regular and wide). Push ups seem to be the only exercise where I feel my chest after the work outs, the rest feel like it works my traps more than anything.

Wanted to ask - is this normal? Is chest harder to see gains than other muscle groups? Should I try other exercises or could something be off with my form?

General info - I do not have access to a gym and probably won't for a few more months. No dip station and can't make a home one either with the stool chairs I have in my apartment. Have access to a workout bench, pull up bar, two dumbbells that go up to 40 lbs each (which I can bench press for 3x12, albeit I'm winded after) and tensions bands.

**Background:** I’ve always been small. 5’9 &amp; 140lbs. I boxed for 4 years but didn’t weight train, I decided to start lifting weights after I got diagnosed with a detached retina. 

It was a lot to learn, and I started off barely benching the bar. Even though it was embarrassing to be at the gym, I still went. 

I bulked to 160lbs during my first year, and continued cutting/bulking cycles. (This is very ineffective, and looking at my physique today, I realize that.) 

In 2019, I got deployed and dropped to my lowest weight ever at 138lbs when it was all said and done. Upon returning home I immediately got back in the gym, and muscle memory hit me like a train. Within a month I was back to 160lbs &amp; I’m currently fluctuating between 175-180lbs

MUSCLE MEMORY IS A DRUG! (I wasn’t even necessarily bulking when I came home, I was eating out constantly and just enjoying myself, but my training was very serious.) 

Overall Transformation (More at the bottom.) : [Imgur link ](https://imgur.com/gallery/5lBqwbA)

 
**Stats:** 5'9"", Male, SW 140LB, CW 180LB

**Lift Progress:** I’m aware I’m not very strong, my numbers should be higher for someone who’s trained for 4 years. But I like to focus on bodybuilding vs powerlifting. There is no shame in that! I stopped worrying about numbers a couple years ago, and I am much happier now that I don’t have that weight on my shoulders. 

**Bench:** 65LB &gt; 245LB (no lie, I barely could do the bar. My first max was legitimately 65lbs) 

**Squat:** 95LB &gt; 315LB

**Deadlift:** 135LB &gt; 375LB

**OHP:** 45LB &gt; 135LB (Most impressive in my opinion, OHP utilizes much more than just shoulder strength! Good technique can get you stronk) 

**Diet:** I tracked calories using the infamous MyFitnessPal app. I started at 2700 cals, &amp; slowly transitioned into 3200 cals. Eating this many calories has always been difficult for me, I thought I was a “hardgainer” but then I realized I was using that as an excuse as to why I’m not hitting my goals. My most successful way of thinking was forcing myself to eat 1000 cals in the morning, &amp; 800 for lunch. Dinner was easy to get calories in, because I could consume 500 cals before the gym, and whatever remained I could fit in after the gym. 

IF YOU’RE BULKING: Breakfast is a HUGE indicator on how your day will go. If you can wake up 30 mins earlier than normal, you’ll have more time to cook quality food and put a dent into the days calories. My favorite breakfast was always: 6 scrambled eggs, 2 Kodiak Pancakes, a bowl of strawberries, &amp; 2 packets of oatmeal. 

Lunch: Usually 8-12oz of chicken breast and 1 cup of rice. With a side of steamed broccoli (thank you instant pot) 

Dinner (Pre Gym): 1 pack of ramen (the sodium gives you joocy pumps.) And a banana (cus helth.) 

Post Gym: 2 scoops of protein shake (50g of protein.)

Dinner (Post Gym): Pasta noodles &amp; ground beef or steak. (Depends what I have time to cook) 

**If I didn’t hit my required calories, I would make my homemade mass gainer shake. 

MY MASS GAINER RECIPE:
-2 scoops of protein
-1 cup oats
-1 spoon of Peanut Butter 
-1/2 banana (eat the other half, it’s just a yummy snack) 
This amounted to approximately 700-800 cals, depending on your protein. 


**Routine:**

I’ve pretty much followed PPL for my whole lifting career. I tried nSuns for a bit, but I didn’t like doing 8sets of power lifts. I was more focused on doing bodybuilding movements. I’ve never done anything out of the ordinary with my training, it’s always been pretty basic and just use what I had at my gym.  


PUSH DAY: 
5x5 Bench Press (FLAT) 

4x12 Bench Press (INCLINE) 

4x15 Pec Deck (Fly’s)

4x10 Chest Press

4x10 Lying Dumbbell Skullcrushers (I noticed I get more activation out of my triceps by using dumbbells versus a EZ bar or barbell.)

4x12 Rope Push Down

4x10 Reverse Pull Down (Use a bar for these and grip the bar underhand, this is my favorite triceps exercise. I’ve never felt activation quite like this.)


PULL DAY
5x5 Deadlifts 

4x10 Barbell Row

3x10 Good Morning (usually after the 3rd set my lower back is like “nah fam” so I rarely went over 3 sets) 

4x10 Lat Pulldown 

4x10 Cable Row 

4x12 Bicep Curls

4x7 Hammer Curls (HEAVY)

4x10 Incline Dumbbell Curls 

4x21 21’s (great to finish off with.)

4x10 Rear Delt Fly


LEG DAY (.. and shoulders)
5x5 Barbell Squat

4x8 Front Squat 

4x10 Leg Press

4x15 Leg Extension (go light, work the eccentric motion. Try to take pressure off your knees, this exercise is notorious for wrecking knees.)

4x12 Hamstring Curl (go light, focus on the SQUEEZE, if you do these right you may have Charlie horses that night in bed. ) 🥴

5x5 Overhead Press 

4x15 Side Lateral Raise 

4x15 Front Raise (Dumbbell) 


***TIPS***

Buying a crock pot / instant pot is a game changer. I could throw a roast or even a steak in the crock pot, let it cook on low while I slept. And when I woke up, I had a fresh meal ready to go! 

DON’T WEIGH YOURSELF EVERYDAY (this can be counterproductive when you get tunnel vision on a number. I weigh myself on Mondays / Thursdays.. And always weigh yourself at the same time everyday. First thing in the morning is best, before you eat.) 

Getting in calories immediately after the gym is an easy way to hit your calorie numbers. Your body is taxed and can absorb more food right after (jk Idk if that’s even true but that’s what I tell myself🤔) nah but for real, it’s always easier for me to get in calories right after the gym, so I usually double scoop a protein shake. 

Creatine is your friend, take creatine. No you don’t have to hand in your natty card, and it won’t cause you to behave any differently. But it does retain water and help you become more “full looking” 

GET BLOODWORK DONE! Usually bloodwork is only recommended if your cycling steroids, but you NEED TO KNOW if your body is producing enough Test, and if certain supplements are needed for your diet!! 


Alright.. what everyone comes for.. here are the..

My favorite breakfast was always: 6 scrambled eggs, 2 Kodiak Pancakes, a bowl of strawberries, &amp;amp; 2 packets of oatmeal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch: Usually 8-12oz of chicken breast and 1 cup of rice. With a side of steamed broccoli (thank you instant pot) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner (Pre Gym): 1 pack of ramen (the sodium gives you joocy pumps.) And a banana (cus helth.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post Gym: 2 scoops of protein shake (50g of protein.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner (Post Gym): Pasta noodles &amp;amp; ground beef or steak. (Depends what I have time to cook) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**If I didn’t hit my required calories, I would make my homemade mass gainer shake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MY MASS GAINER RECIPE:
-2 scoops of protein
-1 cup oats
-1 spoon of Peanut Butter 
-1/2 banana (eat the other half, it’s just a yummy snack) 
This amounted to approximately 700-800 cals, depending on your protein. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve pretty much followed PPL for my whole lifting career. I tried nSuns for a bit, but I didn’t like doing 8sets of power lifts. I was more focused on doing bodybuilding movements. I’ve never done anything out of the ordinary with my training, it’s always been pretty basic and just use what I had at my gym.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PUSH DAY: 
5x5 Bench Press (FLAT) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x12 Bench Press (INCLINE) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x15 Pec Deck (Fly’s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Chest Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Lying Dumbbell Skullcrushers (I noticed I get more activation out of my triceps by using dumbbells versus a EZ bar or barbell.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x12 Rope Push Down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Reverse Pull Down (Use a bar for these and grip the bar underhand, this is my favorite triceps exercise. I’ve never felt activation quite like this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PULL DAY
5x5 Deadlifts &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Barbell Row&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x10 Good Morning (usually after the 3rd set my lower back is like “nah fam” so I rarely went over 3 sets) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Lat Pulldown &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Cable Row &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x12 Bicep Curls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x7 Hammer Curls (HEAVY)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Incline Dumbbell Curls &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x21 21’s (great to finish off with.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Rear Delt Fly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEG DAY (.. and shoulders)
5x5 Barbell Squat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8 Front Squat &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Leg Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x15 Leg Extension (go light, work the eccentric motion. Try to take pressure off your knees, this exercise is notorious for wrecking knees.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x12 Hamstring Curl (go light, focus on the SQUEEZE, if you do these right you may have Charlie horses that night in bed. ) 🥴&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5x5 Overhead Press &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x15 Side Lateral Raise &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x15 Front Raise (Dumbbell) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIPS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a crock pot / instant pot is a game changer. I could throw a roast or even a steak in the crock pot, let it cook on low while I slept. And when I woke up, I had a fresh meal ready to go! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DON’T WEIGH YOURSELF EVERYDAY (this can be counterproductive when you get tunnel vision on a number. I weigh myself on Mondays / Thursdays.. And always weigh yourself at the same time everyday. First thing in the morning is best, before you eat.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting in calories immediately after the gym is an easy way to hit your calorie numbers. Your body is taxed and can absorb more food right after (jk Idk if that’s even true but that’s what I tell myself🤔) nah but for real, it’s always easier for me to get in calories right after the gym, so I usually double scoop a protein shake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatine is your friend, take creatine. No you don’t have to hand in your natty card, and it won’t cause you to behave any differently. But it does retain water and help you become more “full looking” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GET BLOODWORK DONE! Usually bloodwork is only recommended if your cycling steroids, but you NEED TO KNOW if your body is producing enough Test, and if certain supplements are needed for your diet!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright.. what everyone comes for.. here are the..&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Recently my knees have been getting painfully sore during lifts. Its not sharp knee pain, but the area around my knee feels like its swelling/sore. I started noticing it on my squat days, and now I'm also noticing it on deadlift days. I feel fine on days I don't lift legs, and my legs feel fine until I get to my 3rd sets (I'm doing 5/3/1). The last time I had knee issues was from bad form when I first got into lifting like 7 or 8 years ago, that was quickly fixed and I've been fine since.

I've been icing my knees, but I'm wondering if the lack of cardio in my workouts may be contributing to my knees possibly getting weaker? (if that's even a thing) I'm currently squatting and deadlifting more than I ever have in my life, so my knees are probably not used to this. 

Anyone have a good workout to build strength in the knee area for heavier lifting, or advice? Is this just a ""ice them and rest them"" kind of situation or should I be doing stuff to support my knees? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also: I currently don't wear knee sleeves (but have been thinking of buying some), or any other physical gear for squats. Just flat converse shoes - and a belt when I deadlift.

Edit: thank you everyone for the solid advice! It seems pretty obvious I need to learn to squat with a knee sleeve and possibly look into a supplement for the pain/swelling (whatever it is). Thank you all again!

Background: About two years ago, I was a very pudgy, unathletic 185lbs. when I decided to start making an effort to better my health. I learned about CICO, began tracking my calories and making sure I wasn't eating more than 1500 calories/day, as well as started training for half-marathons. This became a pretty on-and-off routine for me during the past two years. Eventually, I was able to get down to 158lbs, and felt pretty great, but I was still physically weak, with not much muscle on me whatsoever.

Five weeks ago, I decided to join a gym and shift my focus towards weight lifting and bulking for the first time in my life. My issue is, I feel like I'm gaining too much fat too quickly, and I honestly feel like shit.

When I started my bulk, I began by eating 3,000 kcal/day, which was a 500 kcal surplus from my TDEE, and I made sure I was getting 160g protein/day. As I started to notice I was putting on more than 1 lb./week,  I started reducing my daily calorie intake, and right now I'm consuming 2,500 kcal/day. But, over the past five weeks I have gained 10 lbs, and my belly is getting noticeably larger at a much faster rate than my muscles. Right now, I feel fat, constantly bloated from forcing myself to eat enough food, and because I'm always bloated I consistently feel lethargic and very low energy. I honestly felt physically better when I only ran and focused on eating fewer calories, which I know is counterintuitive. But, I want to get bigger, stronger, and start putting on muscles, and I know I can only do that by eating more calories.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently doing nSuns 4days/week, as well as running \~15 miles/week.

My typical diet right now is 340g cottage cheese + 1 scoop protein powder for breakfast / chicken breast + leftover veggies + cup of rice for lunch / dinner is usually pretty variable, but I try to keep it within my calorie and protein goals for the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm really just looking for reassurance on whether this is a normal experience, and if I need to suck it up and start raising my daily caloric intake and just accept that fat comes with muscle. I know that five weeks is not a very long time at all to start seeing any progress whatsoever, but if I'm making mistakes, I'd like to start course-correcting as soon as possible.

Not being able to get enough food down is an actual problem that a lot of powerlifters and bodybuilders often face when they’re trying to push the number on the scale. Force feeding is hard work, and can make for being extremely uncomfortable when you have to eat beyond the point of satiation. I’ve been there. The scale stops moving, calories are already extremely high, and you’re really full after every meal and even before your next meal. It can be really frustrating feeling bloated. After all, they say your gut is like a second brain. So if digestion isn’t on point, it’s not unheard of to be unhappy because of it.

I do not have a problem with appetite anymore. There is a number of strategies I have implemented to help getting the food down. I hope the tips that I have accrued throughout this offseason help you out and allow you to get more food down the hatch.

1. PROTEIN IS VERY SATIATING. I started my last prep at 280g of protein per day. That’s a lot of protein for an 82kg person. No wonder I was struggling to finish my meals (I always did though. Despite having to force it down.) The protein was too excessive for my bodyweight. However, I didn’t get my protein that high on purpose. It happened by default when I was upping my carbs. The small amounts of protein you get from carbs such as rice, potatoes and pastas all add up. When I was increasing the calories, I mistakenly kept my serving size of meat for each meal the same. This ended up me continually adding protein to my diet beyond the point of it being excessive. Even a lot of fat sources contain quite a high amount of protein. Fats like nuts and cheese add protein as well. So the approach I took this year was this. Keep protein at 1g/2.5-3x BW in kg. When upping carbs, drop volume of meat per meal to suit with the added protein I’m getting from that meals carb source. Keep in mind, carbohydrates are protein sparring, so especially in a calorie abundant environment, having a little less protein from animal sources won’t be detrimental to progress. It will be helpful, because you’ll be able to get more carbs down. Unlike protein, carbohydrates are appetite stimulating. Leaving you hungrier and ready for your next meal. Every 60 days, I readjust my Fat and Protein numbers to suit my new bodyweight. This usually only makes for a small increase of 5-8g for each. Like I mentioned in a previous blog, my fats stay right around 1g/1kg BW. So keeping fats low and protein moderate, allows me to eat the least satiating macro more, allowing for continuous calorie progression, and no feeling of bloat or distension.
2. 10 MINUTE WALKS. A common problem that people struggling to consume enough calories due to being too full is not efficiently digesting what they’re eating. The first step is to eat foods that you can digest easily. And then consider going for a brisk 10 minute walk following that meal. Improve digestion, improve appetite, also, improve metabolism.
3. Stan Efferding’s patent pending MONSTER MASH. A way I have found making very large meals less intimidating is by making it into a mash by adding roughly 30 mL of chicken broth to it. It makes the large meal SO much easier to eat. It’s almost like the meal is already chewed up for you, you just need to send it down the hatch. Chicken broth has a lot of health and immunity benefits, but it also makes for meals that sit real easy in the stomach, and somehow, probably magic, don’t fill you up. This make consuming 1,000 calories in a sitting feel like Childs play.
4. IF YOU CANT EAT ALL YOUR CARBS, THEN DRINK ‘EM! I use orange juice. 3 times a day, 500mL each. 50g of carbs, 215 calories, fucking delicious. This makes for 150g of carbs, 645 kcal a day just from liquid. It is as satiating as 500 mL of water. Go figure. Plus, loaded with micronutrients.
5. SMALLER, MORE FREQUENT MEALS. No science or research papers to back this one up. The way I see it is simple. I want to look like a bodybuilder, so, i’ll eat like one. Provide the body with a message, hopefully the body gets the message. Give the body enough cellular signalling to achieve the goals that you are intentionally providing it. If you want to fast all day and look like your hobbies include yoga and Prius conferences, then go for it. I find it difficult getting 5,000 calories in, in a 4 hour window. So my solution is simple. Do it the way the bodybuilders have done it from the start. Eat from the moment I get up, to before I go to bed.

This list is simple. Really simple. But it’s these little details that often get overlooked when assessing ones diet. Constant overfeeding, in my opinion, leads to blown-out midsections and enlarged waists. I feel like I fell prey to this after only a year of force feeding. I started the mass phase very lean, got to power-shovelling the food, ate beyond satiation, dieted back down, and my waist was noticeably larger then before. If you’re digesting your food properly, hunger levels follow as a result. If you’re NOT hungry for your next meal, instead of forcing the next one day, firstly, address why it is that you’re not hungry. If you were breaking down food efficiently, you’d be ready to eat every single time that next meal was knocking on your bodybuilding goals door. 

As a side note, Pro Tan emphasises that SHIT out of stretch marks. Blow out your waist? Better get comfortable with the stretch marks on the glutes, hips, lower back and lower abs to stick out like dogs balls.

There’s no such thing as a hard gainer. Every single person that i’ve conversed with who self-diagnosis’ themselves as struggling to put on weight, is simply put, not even close to trying hard enough. Force feeding is really uncomfortable, but it’s not the only means of getting those needed calories down. Learn to choose foods that you can eat in large quantities, pick foods that are extremely dense in calories, and address digestion issues. If the scale isn’t moving upwards, it’s not because you’re a hard gainer, it’s because it doesn’t mean enough to you. To actually illicit some change in bodyweight, you may have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It took me a while of struggling to continue the linear progression of weight gain to start implementing the five tips I outlined above, but when I did, eating became a lot more enjoyable, and easier. Like they say, “Compliance is the science.” So get to eating, but eating smart, and in a manner that stimulates hunger, and not alleviate it.",t2_8m9ciuwj,False,,0,False,IMPROVING APPETITE,[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lweqe9,False,dark,0.98,,public,244,6,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,244,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614754149.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought this might be an interesting read for the kids on here trying to break through weight plateaus.&lt;/p&gt;

So keeping fats low and protein moderate, allows me to eat the least satiating macro more, allowing for continuous calorie progression, and no feeling of bloat or distension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 MINUTE WALKS. A common problem that people struggling to consume enough calories due to being too full is not efficiently digesting what they’re eating. The first step is to eat foods that you can digest easily. And then consider going for a brisk 10 minute walk following that meal. Improve digestion, improve appetite, also, improve metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stan Efferding’s patent pending MONSTER MASH. A way I have found making very large meals less intimidating is by making it into a mash by adding roughly 30 mL of chicken broth to it. It makes the large meal SO much easier to eat. It’s almost like the meal is already chewed up for you, you just need to send it down the hatch. Chicken broth has a lot of health and immunity benefits, but it also makes for meals that sit real easy in the stomach, and somehow, probably magic, don’t fill you up. This make consuming 1,000 calories in a sitting feel like Childs play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IF YOU CANT EAT ALL YOUR CARBS, THEN DRINK ‘EM! I use orange juice. 3 times a day, 500mL each. 50g of carbs, 215 calories, fucking delicious. This makes for 150g of carbs, 645 kcal a day just from liquid. It is as satiating as 500 mL of water. Go figure. Plus, loaded with micronutrients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SMALLER, MORE FREQUENT MEALS. No science or research papers to back this one up. The way I see it is simple. I want to look like a bodybuilder, so, i’ll eat like one. Provide the body with a message, hopefully the body gets the message. Give the body enough cellular signalling to achieve the goals that you are intentionally providing it. If you want to fast all day and look like your hobbies include yoga and Prius conferences, then go for it. I find it difficult getting 5,000 calories in, in a 4 hour window. So my solution is simple. Do it the way the bodybuilders have done it from the start. Eat from the moment I get up, to before I go to bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is simple. Really simple. But it’s these little details that often get overlooked when assessing ones diet. Constant overfeeding, in my opinion, leads to blown-out midsections and enlarged waists. I feel like I fell prey to this after only a year of force feeding. I started the mass phase very lean, got to power-shovelling the food, ate beyond satiation, dieted back down, and my waist was noticeably larger then before. If you’re digesting your food properly, hunger levels follow as a result. If you’re NOT hungry for your next meal, instead of forcing the next one day, firstly, address why it is that you’re not hungry. If you were breaking down food efficiently, you’d be ready to eat every single time that next meal was knocking on your bodybuilding goals door. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, Pro Tan emphasises that SHIT out of stretch marks. Blow out your waist? Better get comfortable with the stretch marks on the glutes, hips, lower back and lower abs to stick out like dogs balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no such thing as a hard gainer. Every single person that i’ve conversed with who self-diagnosis’ themselves as struggling to put on weight, is simply put, not even close to trying hard enough. Force feeding is really uncomfortable, but it’s not the only means of getting those needed calories down. Learn to choose foods that you can eat in large quantities, pick foods that are extremely dense in calories, and address digestion issues. If the scale isn’t moving upwards, it’s not because you’re a hard gainer, it’s because it doesn’t mean enough to you. To actually illicit some change in bodyweight, you may have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It took me a while of struggling to continue the linear progression of weight gain to start implementing the five tips I outlined above, but when I did, eating became a lot more enjoyable, and easier. Like they say, “Compliance is the science.” So get to eating, but eating smart, and in a manner that stimulates hunger, and not alleviate it.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hey all,

Just wanted to drop in and say I just finished my first ever bulk. 

Started this bulk cycle at 190lb on July 1st after having lost 150lb from my peak weight of 340lb back in June of 2019.

Losing that much weight left a lot of loose skin, but I'm working on slowly filling it out with muscle.  https://imgur.com/gallery/WtJMxxE

During this time, I ate at a 500kcal surplus to put on a pound per week. Originally, I had planned on stopping my bulk Jan 1st, but was convinced by u/mythicalstrength to keep going, as there is ""never a wrong time to bulk"". So, I kept it going for an extra two months.

From Mid Jan to Mid Feb, I focused primarily on strength and powerlifting, as my gym has a 1000lb club (combined total lifts between deadlift, squat, and bench all are 1000+lb).

I figured as a home-stretch goal, I wanted to hit those numbers. At the time, however, I was about 25lb short, so I found a peaking program solely based around 4 weeks of growing your 1RM. I increase my calories, started this program, and lifted away.

I am happy to say that at the end of those 4 weeks, I managed to get my goal of hitting 1000lb. https://imgur.com/gallery/SmfFfrN

Ultimately, I'm super happy with my progress. 40lb is a lot of weight to gain, a bunch of fat, but a bunch of is also muscle, so for my first bulk, I'm super happy. Looking forward to cutting for a while to strip away excess body fat. 

Thanks for all your continued support and encouragement!  💕💕💕

EDIT: 

The mod would like food and meal info. So, here goes:

For calories, I ate a total of 3,250/day. Sometimes slightly more. Overall, just making sure I was getting enough calories. I stopped really caring about the scale, as I started weighing myself month instead of weekly, as I really just cared about eating to fuel recovery and growth.

Generally, I get about 220gr of protein a day. That's mainly greek yogurt, lunch meat, some type of lean meat like pork loin, protein scoop in my oatmeal in the morning, protein shake after lifting, and that's mainly it for consistent protein sources. 

The rest of the calories could be whatever. But usually I ate the same thing every day:

Breakfast - 1 cup oatmeal in water with a scoop of protein powder. If I was working out that day, I'd eat about an extra 100kcal of fruit.

Lunch - Two wraps on low carb bread, with 200~ calories of meat, some cheese, some mayo, veggies. If I was working out that day, I'd slam about 6 large marshmallows about 30 minutes before lifting.

Dinner - Either huge bowl of stir fried veggies on rice or with meat. Hebrew National Hot dogs... giant chunk of pork loin... whatever.

Snackies - This is where I ate most of my calories, and almost always at night. Usually ends up being about 1200-1500 calories of snacks into the late evening starting around 8p. This might be a big ass bowl of popcorn, some greek yogurt, left overs, bagels, cheese, fudgsicles, whatever. My nights are usually watching something with the wife or playing nerd games, so I'm usually snacking.

&lt;p&gt;Started this bulk cycle at 190lb on July 1st after having lost 150lb from my peak weight of 340lb back in June of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing that much weight left a lot of loose skin, but I&amp;#39;m working on slowly filling it out with muscle.  &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/WtJMxxE""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/WtJMxxE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time, I ate at a 500kcal surplus to put on a pound per week. Originally, I had planned on stopping my bulk Jan 1st, but was convinced by &lt;a href=""/u/mythicalstrength""&gt;u/mythicalstrength&lt;/a&gt; to keep going, as there is &amp;quot;never a wrong time to bulk&amp;quot;. So, I kept it going for an extra two months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Mid Jan to Mid Feb, I focused primarily on strength and powerlifting, as my gym has a 1000lb club (combined total lifts between deadlift, squat, and bench all are 1000+lb).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured as a home-stretch goal, I wanted to hit those numbers. At the time, however, I was about 25lb short, so I found a peaking program solely based around 4 weeks of growing your 1RM. I increase my calories, started this program, and lifted away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to say that at the end of those 4 weeks, I managed to get my goal of hitting 1000lb. &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/SmfFfrN""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/SmfFfrN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I&amp;#39;m super happy with my progress. 40lb is a lot of weight to gain, a bunch of fat, but a bunch of is also muscle, so for my first bulk, I&amp;#39;m super happy. Looking forward to cutting for a while to strip away excess body fat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all your continued support and encouragement!  💕💕💕&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mod would like food and meal info. So, here goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For calories, I ate a total of 3,250/day. Sometimes slightly more. Overall, just making sure I was getting enough calories. I stopped really caring about the scale, as I started weighing myself month instead of weekly, as I really just cared about eating to fuel recovery and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, I get about 220gr of protein a day. That&amp;#39;s mainly greek yogurt, lunch meat, some type of lean meat like pork loin, protein scoop in my oatmeal in the morning, protein shake after lifting, and that&amp;#39;s mainly it for consistent protein sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the calories could be whatever. But usually I ate the same thing every day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast - 1 cup oatmeal in water with a scoop of protein powder. If I was working out that day, I&amp;#39;d eat about an extra 100kcal of fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch - Two wraps on low carb bread, with 200~ calories of meat, some cheese, some mayo, veggies. If I was working out that day, I&amp;#39;d slam about 6 large marshmallows about 30 minutes before lifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner - Either huge bowl of stir fried veggies on rice or with meat. Hebrew National Hot dogs... giant chunk of pork loin... whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snackies - This is where I ate most of my calories, and almost always at night. Usually ends up being about 1200-1500 calories of snacks into the late evening starting around 8p. This might be a big ass bowl of popcorn, some greek yogurt, left overs, bagels, cheese, fudgsicles, whatever. My nights are usually watching something with the wife or playing nerd games, so I&amp;#39;m usually snacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People mentioned don&amp;#39;t skip leg day. So, I thought I&amp;#39;d drop a bonus leg-day pic. &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/WYKpLJG""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/WYKpLJG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, some of the assistive/auxiliary exercises in PHAT I can't do here, either because I don't have the equipment or they would make too much noise in my apartment if they involve dropping weights or slamming the weights on the catches. 

Here's the exercises I'm looking for alternatives for. 

- Hack Squats. 
 - I know there's a free weight version, but it's essentially like a deadlift where the plates would hit the floor.
 - Trying to learn how to front-squat in the meantime. 
- Leg Extensions
 - Sissy squats? But I heard those are really bad for your knees
- Leg curls
 - ?
- Leg Press

- Lying leg curls
 -  - I can try and do banded lying leg curls, but looking for something better

I don't have much experience with lunges, so I don't know which ones to do or or their set schemes.

- Seated Cable Row
 - I tried using bands, but they're not strong enough

- Close Grip Pull Downs
  - Kinda can do it with the bands if I go extra light and do more isometric squeezes. Dumbbell pullovers put too much strain on my shoulders :(

- Lat pull down
 - Bands definitely don't work for this either. I end up just doing assistive pull-ups and try to do isometric holds to get a similar effect.


A lot of free-weight versions of these assistive/auxiliary exercises are already in the program. Like bent-over/pendly rows, stiff leg/RDL for hamstrings, etc... Should I just do more sets of those exercises?",t2_6bmrcwal,False,,0,False,"Going to start PHAT again, but some of the exercises require equipment I don't have at home.

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some of the assistive/auxiliary exercises in PHAT I can&amp;#39;t do here, either because I don&amp;#39;t have the equipment or they would make too much noise in my apartment if they involve dropping weights or slamming the weights on the catches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the exercises I&amp;#39;m looking for alternatives for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hack Squats. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know there&amp;#39;s a free weight version, but it&amp;#39;s essentially like a deadlift where the plates would hit the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to learn how to front-squat in the meantime. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leg Extensions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sissy squats? But I heard those are really bad for your knees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leg curls

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leg Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lying leg curls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; - I can try and do banded lying leg curls, but looking for something better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have much experience with lunges, so I don&amp;#39;t know which ones to do or or their set schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated Cable Row&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close Grip Pull Downs&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Alright, so I am doing sports for almost a year now (I guess around 10-11 months). I am a guy, 23 years old, I'm about 1,90m tall and weigh approximately 78kg. When I started working out, I was somewhere around 70kg (no doubt the biggest part of my weight gain is because of my diet not being perfect, though I'm not a junkfood junky at all).

In the time I have been working out, I have seen changes, but in my opinion, they aren't going fast enough. I'm doing what I think is right, but sometimes I do think to myself: ""Is this the right way? Should I be doing something else? Or maybe do something different with my weights/diet?"". Therefore, I am now asking it here, to give myself the general idea of things I'm doing wrong and things I'm doing good. Also, I have been working out at home all the time, so the only equipment I have are dumbbells and a bench which basically can't incline/decline.

To give an idea of my workout, I exercise every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. All other days I basically don't workout, at best I take a walk for about 30 minutes. Here is my schedule:

**Tuesday: Triceps/Chest/Legs - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 12kg each.**

* Bench press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Dips - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squeeze press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squats - 3 sets of 10
* Tricep Kickback - 3 sets of 8 on each arm
* Bicep Curl - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* One Arm Tricep Extension - 3 sets of 8 on each arm
* Calf Raise - 3 sets of 15

**Thursday: Legs/Biceps/Triceps - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 12kg each.**

* Push-ups - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Bench press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squeeze press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Lunges - 2 sets of 12 on each leg
* Bicep Curls - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Hammer Curls - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squats - 3 sets of 10
* One Arm Tricep Extension - 3 sets of 8 on each arm

**Saturday: Shoulders/Back - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 10kg each (my shoulders and back are a bit weaker than the rest).**

* Overhead Press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Bent-Over - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Wide-grip Upright Row - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Arnold Press - 2 sets of 10, then 1 set of 8
* Bench Bent-Over - 2 sets of 12 on each arm
* Front Raise - 2 sets of 10, then 1 set of 8 and 1 set of 6 (This one is a bit hard for me to complete all 4 sets properly)
* Shrugs - 3 sets of 15

I basically do all exercises with 30 seconds rest between sets and 90 seconds rest between exercises. Now, finally, the thing I am wondering: Is this the good way to go? For sure my diet can be changed, in fact it probably needs to be changed, but is that the sole reason that I find my ""gains"" to be too slow?

,gainit,"(Current stats and bodywhat link at end)

Title says it all- I’ve been lifting for a long time but I’ve spent a most of that time doing three things- 
1. Crash dieting to the 130-140 lb range, once to 127 lbs, sometimes maintaining this for 4 months 
2. Subsequently getting injured (stress fractures, sprained ankles and wrists, pulled muscles) and losing drive for periods of 3-4 months  
3. Allowing myself to bulk, but soon ending up as fat as before and with barely any additional 
muscle, like 20%.


YEAR 1
Year 1, went from pretty lean , leaner than my oldest bodywhat pic, at about age 18 and 130 lbs, up to 145 lbs with higher bodyfat. I did my first cut 10-11 months into my first year, from 152 to 135. Overall my lifts went up year 1 from 90/160/115/160 ohp/sq/bench/dl up to about 120/270/190/365. Deadlift was with poor form and mixed grip.

YEAR 2-
 I hit ohp/sq/b/dl 130/290/200/420. Years 3-6 I fucked up repeatedly like above.. 2020 was the year I started to gain some common sense, being age 24. 


CURRENT STATS- 

Now, at 25, I’m stuck. My lifts are at a respectable level - s/bench/dl/ohp- estimated around 340/210/440/145. Haven’t tested bench this year though.
However , my body stats are 5’7.75” 165 lbs 21%-22% bodyfat (estimated with laser X-ray vision). 

More importantly, my damn arms and calves are tiny. I have about 13.5-14” flexed arms, 10.5” forearms, 13.25” calves, on a 7.3” ankle and 6” wrist frame. 

I train hard and end up feeling like an emptied toothpaste tube at the end of my workouts, and have an extremely good diet and sleep. I have normal to high testosterone, with all my tests ever ranging from 640-900, usually at 750 ng/dl.
I don’t know why I’m having so much trouble building muscle! It’s like I can only gain muscle on my ass, thighs, and shoulders, but even then, mostly fat.

&lt;p&gt;Title says it all- I’ve been lifting for a long time but I’ve spent a most of that time doing three things- 
1. Crash dieting to the 130-140 lb range, once to 127 lbs, sometimes maintaining this for 4 months 
2. Subsequently getting injured (stress fractures, sprained ankles and wrists, pulled muscles) and losing drive for periods of 3-4 months&lt;br/&gt;
3. Allowing myself to bulk, but soon ending up as fat as before and with barely any additional 
muscle, like 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YEAR 1
Year 1, went from pretty lean , leaner than my oldest bodywhat pic, at about age 18 and 130 lbs, up to 145 lbs with higher bodyfat. I did my first cut 10-11 months into my first year, from 152 to 135. Overall my lifts went up year 1 from 90/160/115/160 ohp/sq/bench/dl up to about 120/270/190/365. Deadlift was with poor form and mixed grip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YEAR 2-
 I hit ohp/sq/b/dl 130/290/200/420. Years 3-6 I fucked up repeatedly like above.. 2020 was the year I started to gain some common sense, being age 24. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CURRENT STATS- &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, at 25, I’m stuck. My lifts are at a respectable level - s/bench/dl/ohp- estimated around 340/210/440/145. Haven’t tested bench this year though.
However , my body stats are 5’7.75” 165 lbs 21%-22% bodyfat (estimated with laser X-ray vision). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, my damn arms and calves are tiny. I have about 13.5-14” flexed arms, 10.5” forearms, 13.25” calves, on a 7.3” ankle and 6” wrist frame. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I train hard and end up feeling like an emptied toothpaste tube at the end of my workouts, and have an extremely good diet and sleep. I have normal to high testosterone, with all my tests ever ranging from 640-900, usually at 750 ng/dl.
I don’t know why I’m having so much trouble building muscle! It’s like I can only gain muscle on my ass, thighs, and shoulders, but even then, mostly fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bodywhat -  has a few pics from bulks and cuts for perspective&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hey all,

I've been gaining on and off for roughly two years. Making progress and losing it due to work/stress. Now that work has finally died down I want to go full forward and gain 30-40lbs. Now my question is, is varying my calorie intake depending on what I did that day okay? 

I get it might not be the most effective but I have trouble getting my 4000kcal intake on weekends where my days have little to no structure, unlike during the work week where I get up and get home at the same time. Hours will pass by on the weekend I will have forgotten to eat.

Now my 4000kcal intake is due to the nature of my work - im walking 20km a day usually, and my intake has to reflect that. On the weekends I'd much rather stomach 2800kcal and still be in a surplus, since I do very little walking, and hopefully still be gaining.

In December, After talking with a couple people and self-reflecting I realized it wasn’t working, and started using Arnold’s basic beginner program #1 using higher weight around 40-60 depending on the exercise, and 15 pounds for dumbbells

Current day, I have to be honest with saying I’ve seen no real progression, and it pisses me off that I have wasted so much time, and I blame no one but myself for not taking time to do proper research. I’ve chalked it up to a few things:

Diet: I never was keeping track of what I was eating, and I really can’t be eating so much since Im apart of a relatively big family and can’t be eating, say 3-5 eggs for breakfast a day. I also am pretty limited to whatever my parents make for dinner. As for breakfast and lunch, I have been eating things such as oatmeal, cottage cheese, eggs, etc + breakfast at school as it’s now free where I live.

Weight, reps, sets: I mentioned the weight I’ve been using earlier, and as for reps I’ve been trying 6-8 for 4 sets, but I’m unsure if any of this is right as I find my arms giving out way to early into the sets for an exercise.

Days spent lifting: I’ve always lifted weights Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but I’m considering lifting weights 5 days out of the week instead of just three.

At this point, I’m basically still a beginner. I could use any advice from anyone out there, as I have no idea how to get efficient results.

&lt;p&gt;In December, After talking with a couple people and self-reflecting I realized it wasn’t working, and started using Arnold’s basic beginner program #1 using higher weight around 40-60 depending on the exercise, and 15 pounds for dumbbells&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current day, I have to be honest with saying I’ve seen no real progression, and it pisses me off that I have wasted so much time, and I blame no one but myself for not taking time to do proper research. I’ve chalked it up to a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diet: I never was keeping track of what I was eating, and I really can’t be eating so much since Im apart of a relatively big family and can’t be eating, say 3-5 eggs for breakfast a day. I also am pretty limited to whatever my parents make for dinner. As for breakfast and lunch, I have been eating things such as oatmeal, cottage cheese, eggs, etc + breakfast at school as it’s now free where I live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight, reps, sets: I mentioned the weight I’ve been using earlier, and as for reps I’ve been trying 6-8 for 4 sets, but I’m unsure if any of this is right as I find my arms giving out way to early into the sets for an exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days spent lifting: I’ve always lifted weights Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but I’m considering lifting weights 5 days out of the week instead of just three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m basically still a beginner. I could use any advice from anyone out there, as I have no idea how to get efficient results. Any critiques, plans, and help will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll start off with a bit of information:
I am a 16 year old male who is trying to gain weight and tone up. I am currently 6'4"" and weigh around 143 pounds (I know, I'm underweight). 

I work out 6 days a week on average and my routine consists of:

• Pushups (around 50 throughout the day)

• Crunches (2 sets of 25)

• Leg raises ( 2 sets of 30)

• One minute plank

• V sit ups (3 sets of 10)

• Bicep curls (3 sets of 8)

• Squats (3 sets of 10)

Now for the main point of this post. I obviously need to gain weight and my goal is to get to around 160 pounds or so. Should I just be eating as much as possible without taking the quality and health benefits of the food into consideration, or should I be eating nutritious meals?

,gainit,"Hi all, I humbly request advice.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a 20 year old college student. I've been ""seriously"" training since summer of 2019, so about 1.5 years now. I got my numbers up (starting from the bar) for about a semester before that first summer, but didn't really have any idea about nutrition or programming. I didn't have much sports background before, and was very skinny (5'8 138 lb), so I essentially started from nothing. I made OK progress initially (both visually and strength). I lost record of my numbers, but by September 2020, my SBD was likely around 300/190/(spent a long time practicing form for deadlifts), at 168 lb. Up till this point, I was using the nSuns 5 day routine, but had seen diminishing returns and it was getting boring, so I switched to the CoolCicada PPL routine, but kept the nSuns squat layout for the leg days. 

&amp;nbsp;

By November, I had gotten my squat to a max of 345 once (highest working set was 315x4 a week before that max attempt), and bench didn't really increase much--I did 205 with poor, grindy form once, but from September to November, general working sets for the heavier bench day only went from 155 5x5 to 165 5x5. Continued practicing deadlifts and got closer to 300 with solid form.

&amp;nbsp;

I was slightly depressed/lethargic at home for break, and did a couple of weeks of traveling with just body weight exercises, so I pretty much just maintained until January, still doing the PPL routine. Since I had been bulking for the entirety of my lifting journey and was getting a bit fluffier at 177lb, I decided to cut, and since I was not really seeing much progress with a linear program, I also concurrently began Candito's 6 week ""intermediate"" program mixed with his bench program since I needed more practice with bench. Starting that program, I entered my 1RMs at 320/200/300, since I was still feeling slightly rusty from winter break. Currently in the middle of week 5 of the program (and of my cut), and I've lost 8-9 pounds back to 168, and my strength is pretty much the same as 5 weeks before, which is fine. I have to admit, I rarely tracked calories when I bulked--I ate similar whole foods daily, and was gaining weight at a relatively slow pace. Since starting my cut, I've been eating around 2k-2.1k calories daily, about 180g P, 200g C, and 50g F, and walking to and from campus a total of 3 miles 5 days a week.

&amp;nbsp;

During the previous few weeks and last semester, I would never miss a training session, try my best during those sessions, am cognizant about improving form, would eat in a surplus with enough protein, sleep an average of 7 hours, and have done a lot of research on nutrition and training. Yet, I'm not satisfied with my progress both visually and strength-wise. Week to week, I'm not so discouraged by my strength not increasing, since I understand it takes time, but looking back at the last 6+ months, it is a bit disheartening to see minimal progress even as I (think I) put in the work. I compared a progress pictures in the same lighting, pose, and no-pump from today and October, and I can see essentially no difference. I understand progress typically slows as one trains for longer, but seeing as how I'm still so early on my journey, I expected more significant change. Obviously, I'm not giving up and will continue to train with intent.

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice or recommended resources? I'd love to hear some perspectives on how to move forward, and welcome any and all critiques as long as it's constructive. My current goals are to build a more substantive muscular base and improve strength.

&lt;p&gt;During the previous few weeks and last semester, I would never miss a training session, try my best during those sessions, am cognizant about improving form, would eat in a surplus with enough protein, sleep an average of 7 hours, and have done a lot of research on nutrition and training. Yet, I&amp;#39;m not satisfied with my progress both visually and strength-wise. Week to week, I&amp;#39;m not so discouraged by my strength not increasing, since I understand it takes time, but looking back at the last 6+ months, it is a bit disheartening to see minimal progress even as I (think I) put in the work. I compared a progress pictures in the same lighting, pose, and no-pump from today and October, and I can see essentially no difference. I understand progress typically slows as one trains for longer, but seeing as how I&amp;#39;m still so early on my journey, I expected more significant change. Obviously, I&amp;#39;m not giving up and will continue to train with intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice or recommended resources? I&amp;#39;d love to hear some perspectives on how to move forward, and welcome any and all critiques as long as it&amp;#39;s constructive. My current goals are to build a more substantive muscular base and improve strength. Thank you all very much!&lt;/p&gt;

Ok I’m technically 176.6 lol but yesterday I was 176.8 so I’m calling it 177. I’m 31 yrs old.

Then before I knew it, gyms shut down again, and I promptly lost those gains.

Mid-January came around and the gyms were back open. I’ve hit the gym 22 times in the last 40 days and am seeing some results. I’m on Kinobody’s Greek God program, which is a 3 day split. It’s more or less a pull, push, legs/traps split. I decided 3x a week wasn’t enough for me so I’m adding in another 1-2 days a week for mobility, and to do a little extra neck and traps work.

What I Ate because this is r/gainit:

 I did shakes at the beginning but never twice a day and they never amounted over 1k calories probably because laziness. After about 2-3 months I transitioned fully into drinking half a gallon of fairlife milk a day, since then it’s basically been impossible for me to miss protein any day. If anything I tend to go way overboard and have been working on cutting back protein intake. I also made sure to get 4-8 servings of vegetables everyday (mostly spinach) because they made me feel good. Boring chicken and rice a lot but I’ve never really cared about what I ate before so it didn’t matter much to me as long as I hit my macros. I ate 3-6 eggs everyday because I read somewhere they’re filled with micros and immediately trusted that source. I work a physical job so easy access foods were important for those 8 hours, this is when I drank the milk and ate about 900 calories worth of almonds, cashews, and dark chocolate. I incorporated variety at some points but milk, nuts, dark chocolate, eggs, chicken, rice, and spinach were the most frequently consumed foods. I also tracked my calories pretty religiously for 4/5 months but in the past month I’ve gotten lazy and am still gaining around the right amount so that’s nice. 

What I do at the gym:

Slight case of fuckarounditis but I do go to the gym 5 days a week doing a PPLUL split and I train very very hard. Also did 0 direct ab training in this time.

Thoughts about gaining so far:

I can’t stress how much I prefer not having to hear how skinny I am everyday, that was pretty annoying. Other guys seem to respond better to me now, the girl response is mostly the same as before. Around maybe 10ish people in my day to day life have noticed, and like 3/4 ar the gym I go to regularly. I think I’m going to go to 160 and then cut for the summer, but that depends on my satisfaction with my lifts. For some reason I don’t care that much about the bulk belly I have or the fat I gained despite family members pointing it out all the time. Overall I would rate gaining 25 pounds as a positive experience.

Drugs:

None obviously except I did smoke weed once with a friend and ate like $50 worth of sashimi and sushi by myself.",t2_6daof7vq,False,,0,False,[Progress] 22/M/5’7 126.6lbs (57kg) - 151.6lbs (69kg),[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lo32vx,False,dark,0.97,,public,200,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,200,,False,,1613811542.0,,[],{},,True,,1613839732.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;September 3rd, 2020: &lt;/p&gt;

I also tracked my calories pretty religiously for 4/5 months but in the past month I’ve gotten lazy and am still gaining around the right amount so that’s nice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do at the gym:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slight case of fuckarounditis but I do go to the gym 5 days a week doing a PPLUL split and I train very very hard. Also did 0 direct ab training in this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts about gaining so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress how much I prefer not having to hear how skinny I am everyday, that was pretty annoying. Other guys seem to respond better to me now, the girl response is mostly the same as before. Around maybe 10ish people in my day to day life have noticed, and like 3/4 ar the gym I go to regularly. I think I’m going to go to 160 and then cut for the summer, but that depends on my satisfaction with my lifts. For some reason I don’t care that much about the bulk belly I have or the fat I gained despite family members pointing it out all the time. Overall I would rate gaining 25 pounds as a positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drugs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None obviously except I did smoke weed once with a friend and ate like $50 worth of sashimi and sushi by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Two minor problems:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A little more fat gain than I'd like (need to get fat on a bulk, but to be fair I think I was a bit fat when I started, just carried it well on a tallish frame)
2. Some niggly pains at various joints/tendons/ligaments; not major, but nonetheless a sign of stress

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of resting for half a week, resuming, then seeing how I feel. If niggles persist, I will take off another half week. If still persisting, a full week. Still working on form and conditioning the body so hope that these minor pains will eventually fade. Have at times been guilty of lifting too heavy too quickly (not sensible).

During this lower intensity period I will reduce to a caloric deficit as though I was cutting, although keeping reasonably high protein for muscle maintenance.

Essentially I am initiating a (very) miniature cut/repair phase, then resuming the bulk. Depending on fat gain/joint pains, may repeat this every month (half a week) or every two months (full week).

Is this sensible? I'm a beginner, although instinct tells me this could be worth it in the long-term. Obviously concerned about losing muscle gains, and whilst I'm not really believing that this is a danger with such a minor change, would be nice to hear others' opinions.

So I’ve got my breakfast routine sorted. Posted previously about breakfast prep, and since discovered burritos. 100g beef, 2 x eggs &amp;amp; peppers, 1 x hash brown, cheese, hot sauce, tortilla. Bulk prep. In the freezer. Done for the week. Awesome. Circa. 550 calories, 45g protein each. Mixed with my breakfast shake, it’s circa. 1,100 calories and 85g protein before I’ve even got to midday.

However, mind is now going to how to improve lunches and prep for them (as work full time). They’re ok at the moment, but could be better and less time consuming. Don’t want a huge lunch as would prefer to have bigger dinner after all the calories at breakfast. To fit in with my goals, lunch only needs to be around 400/500 calories and 30g protein.

One of the big things that puts me off prepping a week of lunches is I really despise the taste of reheated microwave chicken.

Are there any recipes that you can suggest that avoid this? Or any general tips? Maybe my pre-prepared chicken needs to be in a sauce / broth kind of situation to avoid / mask that awful dry / chemical taste when reheating chicken? Or maybe I should just stick with another meat? But just don’t want to be eating beef 3 x times a day as that will get old. Turkey I’m not a fan of at all. I do like ham though but not sure it’s the best meat for bulking?

Picture on the far left is about 6 months ago, middle picture is 2 months ago, and right picture was from yesterday.

I started my ""fitness journey"" after my break-up about 6 months ago.  I lost 30 lbs following IF 16:8 and doing some kind of physical activity daily (i.e., Greyskull LP with accessories &amp; cardio).  2 months ago I hit my ""goal weight"" and was starting to follow the LeanGains methodology to pack on some muscle.  Unfortunately, in those 2 months I haven't seen much progress; my lifting numbers and PRs have gone up, but not a lot of physical changes.  I have been eating at a very slight surplus with 1 gram of protein per body weight (i.e., 140 grams).

I'm going to start a ""classic"" bulk of 500 surplus calories daily.  Going from eating less to lose weight to eating a lot more to gain muscle has been a challenge, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.

I'm following 5/3/1 for Beginners now with a fair amount of accessories.

https://imgur.com/a/7J0Ne0x (last 3 pics are within 2 days of each other, just different lighting) 

I don’t track my calories to the exact amount, but always make sure I’m getting above 3k per day, and usually around 180-200 grams of protein. My diet is nothing different than the hundreds of posts you see on this subreddit, so not gonna touch on that, but I will say that mass gainer shakes helped out immensely the first month or so when adjusting to a bigger diet. 

Lifts
——-

Unfortunately I have only had access to a smith machine so can’t really compare these numbers to a true barbell lift, but: 

Bench: 145 1rm - 215 1rm

Squat: 185 1rm - 265 1rm 

I’ve noticed consistent growth in all of the accessory lifts I’ve done as well so happy about that. 

Routine
————-
4 day split:

-Chest and Tris 

-Back and Bis

-Legs

-Shoulders, Bis and Tris

-Rest


Goals
———

Short term (Daily/Weekly)

-Weigh myself every morning to get a consistent weekly average of weight 

-Hit 3200+calories per day or more depending on weight measurements

-Gain between .5lb-1lb per week


Medium Term: (3-12 months)

-Hit a true 225 bench press

-Hit a true 315 squat 

-Hit 190 weight 

-Join a new gym with free barbells so I can incorporate deadlift and OHP into my routine 


Long term: (1 year +)

-200 lb weight

-successfully go through a gaining/cutting cycle 
-1000 lb club 


Conclusion
——————
Overall I’ve learned a lot the last 3 months thanks to this subreddit and my brother who is an advanced lifter.

I'm 18yo and have always been really skinny (like really) and I decided to go to the gym since 1.5years now and went from around 55kg to 70kg. (1m76-77 -&gt; 1m81
The problem is that I did gain a lot of muscle but I also gained some FAT.
I was more around 11% bf before and now I'm more at like 15% and I feel like it starts to be a bit too much.

The thing is that I want to lose this extra fat so I know that I should just go on a fat loss.
The thing is that I don't want to be back to like low 60kgs because I would be so skinny again and I just don't want to be THAT skinny anymore.
Honestly, having a bodyfat of around 11% would be perfectly fine for me but I'm really afraid of losing all my gains.
It may be obvious but I have a fast metabolism which means that it was always hard for me to bulk.

But getting back on subject. This is my first cut and I recently decided to cut down to 175lbs from 200lbs. Im dropping my calories from 2,300 to 1,660 and making sure I get around 130g of protein daily to help minimize strength loss.

I work out 5-6 days a week so that means I'm Benching and squatting 3-4x a week. I love the progress I have been making and the idea that I might be losing strength/ Not being able to handle the volume bothers me a little but is something I can accept.

Im sure I will be able to continue making gains on my squats and deads considering they are so low. But I'm curious about more ways to increase my bench during my cut if the volume starts to become too taxing. I want to reach a 330 Bench by july.

P.s My Deads and Squats are low because I injured my lower back due to bad form from both. I decided to drop my weight very low to focus on my form and build from there.

Hi,

24M 5’7 135 lbs

Wanted to ask for some opinions:

I used to work out at least twice a week for my entire life (have been lifting recreationally since I’m 15) and was stable at around 145 lbs that way. Now after last March everything changed and I stopped working out almost completely.

I started having some GI problems around March too that I still have to this date. Now my question is: how realistic is it to lose 10 lbs of muscle/glycogen/water over this period?

I look at myself in the mirror today and can barely recognize myself. My legs look very skinny and my arms too. I wasn’t swole by any means, but I was definitely in decent shape (no visible abs, but solid back and arms for example).

I’ve been worried that all this weight I’ve lost has been from my GI issues, but I just realized some of it could be muscle too.

Did anyone else lose such a large amount of mass just from not working out during 2020?

&lt;p&gt;I started having some GI problems around March too that I still have to this date. Now my question is: how realistic is it to lose 10 lbs of muscle/glycogen/water over this period?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look at myself in the mirror today and can barely recognize myself. My legs look very skinny and my arms too. I wasn’t swole by any means, but I was definitely in decent shape (no visible abs, but solid back and arms for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been worried that all this weight I’ve lost has been from my GI issues, but I just realized some of it could be muscle too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did anyone else lose such a large amount of mass just from not working out during 2020?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

Hey guys it’s me again lmao if any of you remember me from over six months ago! 

Conversions for metric people: 56-72.3kg

As usual, you guys come for the pics so here they are first

For my routine, I just roughly follow the r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine and added some dumbbell exercises with adjustable weights for progressive overload. Feel free to DM or comment to ask more haha. Also, I dance three times a week for around 2-3 hours each time. 

Honestly for me I just workout every other day before I sleep, and with school and everything I can’t be bothered to follow a full on routine with what some of you guys have here. For me I just want to establish the habit of working out and enjoying it so in the future I can take up different routines more easily and progress from there. I’m still 16 and I don’t want to put so much thought into this just yet so this is me not really taking this whole thing overly seriously. 

In the last post, (it’s in my profile still you guys can go check haha) some of you guys commented on the carb/sugar stuff so I really tried to watch that. I lost some weight after that to cut down on the fat and now I’m trying to gain weight again but I’m being more careful this time. What really helps for me recently was weighing everyday to see if I was gaining a sensible amount. 

For 2021, I really made it a point to not skip workouts or at least get something in on my workout days, since consistency is so important and it’s something I lacked last year which slowed my progress. 

Right now I’m still trying to gain weight but I’m really watching the fat and I’ll cut down once summer nears. 

I hope my post inspires someone to at least start or helps anyone low on motivation

Up unto February of last year I could squat fine no problem and had a one rep of 245 (yea not the best I know).

Hi guys, back with another annual progress thread!

This is a follow-up from this post I made two years ago where you can read more about me and my story: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress\_m2159\_110lbs\_50kg\_152lbs\_69kg\_1\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress_m2159_110lbs_50kg_152lbs_69kg_1_year/)

And: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/fbs820/progress\_m2259\_110lbs\_50kg\_156lbs\_707kg\_2\_years/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/fbs820/progress_m2259_110lbs_50kg_156lbs_707kg_2_years/)

**Since the last post, I've gained another 4 lbs this year and have made huge strength and aesthetic gains.**

I still eat the exact same stuff as stated in my post from a year back. However, I sometimes incorporate pork and the odd ""cheat meal"" from time to time, which tend to cause me issues the following days. I won't be doing this anymore from now.

I've since learned that it's important to be grateful for what you CAN eat, even if it's not much. And also the fact that I live a (mostly) pain-free life without meds after my surgeries and daily routine consisting of eating the same foods and taking turmeric, Boswellia, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, propolis, Salmon fish oil, creatine, L-glutamine, working out (and lots of walking outdoors), and a regular sleeping schedule.

Before: [https://imgur.com/a/UOyRXx7](https://imgur.com/a/UOyRXx7) (110lbs / 50kg) 20 years old

Before the before: [https://imgur.com/a/HsV9fAT](https://imgur.com/a/HsV9fAT) (143lbs / 65kg) 19 years old

After: [https://imgur.com/a/gsbUxiV](https://imgur.com/a/gsbUxiV) (152lbs / 69kg) 21 years old

**CURRENT:** [https://imgur.com/a/RtW2Q3s](https://imgur.com/a/RtW2Q3s) **(160lbs / 72.5kg) 23 years old**

&amp;#x200B;

**My workout routine has changed significantly:**

* 10 sets of my max push-ups and shrugs per day (with a tiny 40lbs dumbbell held in both hands, need to upgrade asap). I do this for two days in a row. So about 350-400 push-ups and shrugs with perfect form, really taking my time to do the exercise rather than just chasing numbers.
* 10 sets of my max super wide-grip TOWEL pull-ups and bicep curls. I am going to post a pic later of how I set it up at home. So about 70-80 pull-ups and 50-60 curls with a 40lbs dumbbell. Incredible strength gains in my back, forearms, fingers, and grip overall.

That's it. I do a lot of walking for my legs and also some basic mobility exercises with a resistance band, one-legged calf ""jumping"" raises, and jumping lunges.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some word of advice after many years of doing this:**

* Do stuff that's hard. The numbers don't matter and are subjective. If you can't do more than 5 push-ups in one go, doing 50 per day is going to skyrocket your gains in the next month, then you can move on to more and more to continue offering the same challenge to your body as before
* Perfect form every single time. Humping the ground or looking like you're doing the worm will do little to help you advance along the way. 20 reps with perfect form are way better than 40 half-assed attempts
* For those with digestive issues - calculate your calories needed to bulk up, then experiment until you find your safe foods. Blood tests may be needed regularly at first to make sure you're not increasing your inflammation levels. I'm lucky to be able to eat white bread and not be gluten intolerant, I can't tolerate most fats, but I can eat a shit ton of tahini (sesame paste), so the majority of my calories come from there. The rest are from chicken and rice. I don't calculate macros, but they're probably something like 45% carbs, 35% fats, 20% protein
* If you're easily bored with long, varied routines like me (I know that's a paradox in itself) just find a few exercises that really work well for you and spam the shit out of them
* Researchers constantly come up with contradicting studies. Don't go down the rabbit hole of listening to dudes that spend more time researching the best way to gain muscle and then arguing about it over actually working out. All of those that I know irl think I'm fucking with them when I tell them that I don't go to the gym and only do push-ups and pull-ups

P.S. Can't recommend shaving your head and growing some facial hair enough! I used to be super-feminine looking but now just looking at myself in the mirror finally gives me satisfaction and a ""damn, you kinda look manly"" feeling, which I've read can actually increase your testosterone levels (the looking at yourself in the mirror with a beard part). I'll link up the study later.

,gainit,"Hey guys, been progressing well on lifts, including bench, and I'm always very conscious of my form on bench to prevent RC injuries, yet sometimes post sets I still feel a little inflammation/warmth coming from the RC.  

&amp;#x200B;

My standard routine for bench is to warm up with shoulder swings, across the chest stretches, and then probably 10 reps of bench at 45, 5 reps at 95, 5 reps at 135, then whatever my rep/set-weight is.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm extremely conscious to squeeze my scapula together to be flat on the bench, and maintain that squeeze through the reps.  I use a grip that's fairly wide, about two fingers away from non-knurled ring, that allows for straight up and down forearm maintenance through the movement that hits my chest well.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I'll do a set of 3 175, feel a great pump in my chest, no pain in the RC, other times I'll do a set of 135 for 5 reps and find myself after slightly bothered by my RC.

I am a 15M (5'11"", 155LBS) who has been lifting seriously for about 8 months now, (1 year and half beforehand without proper programming). I also play baseball for my High School JV Baseball Team.

,gainit,"Bit of background….

I spent the whole of 2020 losing weight. Dropped 40lbs to 147lb (Male, 5’11”) 

Got super lean through calorie deficit and cardio, around 10% body fat which was always my goal before I started lifting (yes I know I should have started lifting sooner!)

So now I’ve been lifting 5x per week since 1st December and since 1st Jan have been on a reverse diet. 

Finished my cut on 2000 cals/day and since then I have done:

2 weeks at 2200 (still lost weight)
2 weeks at 2400 (still lost weight) 

Now coming to the end of 2 weeks at 2700 and looks like I will gain around 1lb after the 2 weeks. 

But is this long enough to confirm I’m in a surplus? My brain is telling me no, if I lost weight at 2400 over 2 weeks then I’m not going to be gaining weight at 2700. 

Where I’m still a new lifter I think there’s an element of newbie muscle gain contributing to the ‘gain’ as well as the fact that my diet is a lot more carb heavy than it was when cutting. 

Would you do another 2 weeks at 2700 and then observe the results over 4 weeks? 

I’m REALLY wanting to dial in on my maintenance calories before I dive into ‘bulk mode’ as I want to make my bulk as lean as possible so it’s really important for me to not jump to the wrong conclusions. 

My training, including cardio volume, has been VERY consistent throughout this whole reverse diet phase. 

I’m using the average method of calculating my weight but my daily weight fluctuates so much that it can be hard to make sense even of the average over 1-2 weeks. 

For example my weight this week has ranged anywhere from 145.5lb to 149.7lb - so to use an average of the week to inform a decision about whether I’m in a net surplus/deficit seems a bit dangerous and easy to draw the wrong conclusions.

First off, have checked the FAQ info, but not sure it answers my question really...

I’m looking to improve my breakfast game. I currently eat 2 x eggs quickly scrambled, and a shake (oats, blueberries, yoghurt, banana, protein powder, peanut butter, water).

However, my breakfast appetite has been increasing over the years. Feel like I could be eating more at this time.

But we all know breakfast is early and annoying to do every day. So I want to make something that can last pretty much all week (or at least a few days). Get up early one morning and just do the prep. That I can make one big pot of (I have a big Le Creuset).

I saw Alan Thrall’s mountain man breakfast and it inspired me. I was thinking: sausages, potatoes, onions, peppers, and then lots of eggs all over the top. Maybe some cheese.

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking to improve my breakfast game. I currently eat 2 x eggs quickly scrambled, and a shake (oats, blueberries, yoghurt, banana, protein powder, peanut butter, water).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my breakfast appetite has been increasing over the years. Feel like I could be eating more at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we all know breakfast is early and annoying to do every day. So I want to make something that can last pretty much all week (or at least a few days). Get up early one morning and just do the prep. That I can make one big pot of (I have a big Le Creuset).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw Alan Thrall’s mountain man breakfast and it inspired me. I was thinking: sausages, potatoes, onions, peppers, and then lots of eggs all over the top. Maybe some cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any big one-pot breakfast recipes you know of? Anyone else do this? Do they last long in the fridge? Taste ok reheated? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any info appreciated!!&lt;/p&gt;

Howdy fellas, wanted to update my progress from about 6 months ago, definitely been on and off of training and eating, but also DEFINITELY been gaining mass. 
Eating less sets me back more than training less I would say, find it funny that a cheat day for me is when I only have 2 meals all day, the way my appetite is naturally.

The before photo literally scares me when I look at it, tbf I was suffering from some health issues but regardless, IF YOU’RE SKINNY EAT BIG AND TRAIN BIG, you’ll love and thank your self later.
I hopped out of the shower and literally just had to admire my progress I’m so thankful for learning about intricacies of caloric intake and workout programs on this sub. 
I’m super lean rn in terms of fat, just holding some water weight due to creatine. I’d say I’m actually about 73.5kg

Right now my numbers are going up in the weight room, but I’m only pushing 2500 calories, so I’d def say lean bulking which is exhausting- I’m sleeping for 10 hours minimum but I feel great. I’m trying to move into more intermediate/ advanced programs as I’ve just been sticking to PPL routine, any suggestions are appreciated?!

I’m super lean rn in terms of fat, just holding some water weight due to creatine. I’d say I’m actually about 73.5kg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now my numbers are going up in the weight room, but I’m only pushing 2500 calories, so I’d def say lean bulking which is exhausting- I’m sleeping for 10 hours minimum but I feel great. I’m trying to move into more intermediate/ advanced programs as I’ve just been sticking to PPL routine, any suggestions are appreciated?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My form is rubbish as to be expected from a beginner , it’s weird how I can always push my max for 2 reps. And moving up in weight I can’t push one rep... this is especially the case for deadlifts.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hi guys,

I am just wondering if anyone here has has issues with general stomach issues related to eating. For me, this is general discomfort and mild nasuea when I eat, sometimes with a little acid reflux on the side.

I know there are some types of foods that are tougher on the stomach, and I have done some research on things that should be avoided. The difficulty here is a lot of those things are high calorie/fat foods that are good for bulking. I have also heard that spreading eating across smaller meals throughout the day can help, but I think it is fair to say that for most people this is difficult to do with a regular work/life schedule. I don't have a crippling problem, I don't vomit after eating or wake up vomiting from heartburn. Its just bothersome enough that I have difficulty eating 3000+ calories in a day.

I have a good feeling most people here will suggest talking to my doctor about it, but I am just looking for some insight from anyone with similar experiences.

I should note that I am currently 6'2"" 163lbs or so. My max was around 185lbs, and during this time I was eating a lot, but it was still a struggle as I was often eating til I felt sick. With this pandemic I haven't been working out or eating as much and I have just recently begun making an effort to gain back some weight. But I'm noticing it is even more difficult than ever to eat a lot. I can feel like i'm not very ""full"" per se, but can't bring myself to eat anymore because I feel so bloated. Like I know there's room in there but my body is telling me it's not worth it.

I guess I'm just taking a shot in the dark here and wondering if someone in a similar situation was able to do something simple to allow them to either eat more or supplement macros in another way.

I work from home from 8-5pm and gotta get OUT of this chair more!! I'm in shape but in a huge rut for 3 months.

Here's my idea:

Start an interval timer right at 8am that will **loop all day**:

* **15 minutes**: Work (day job) for 15 straight minutes without interruption \*BEEP\*
* **1 minute**: Get up and Lift/Exercise  

   * Using dumbbells right behind my chair.
   * Can be any exercise as long as I'm hustling the entire minute. Will likely alternate between either a) same exercise all day or b) alternate muscle groups every cycle
   * Lifting for 1 minute is about 8-12 reps
* **4 minutes**: Remaining 4 minutes for break/bathroom/leisure

Then loop. So I would get 3 hard minutes of exercise every 60 minutes.

**8 hour work day = 24 minutes of exercise.**

,gainit,"Pics:  https://imgur.com/gallery/HlbB3zj   First is at 155-160, second at 195. (Wake up, post piss)

Timeline: Get to school freshman year (150), bulk until sent home because of the covid second semester (185). I didn't work out or eat over the summer so started school sophomore year (170), bulk to thanksgiving (195), back to school after winter break (180) then to now (190). 

I didn't work out pretty much at all the entire summer of 2020. Gains are from basically 10 months in the gym spread out over a bit over a year. 

Lifts: 

Bench- 265

Squat- 315

Deadlift- 425

Overhead press- 145

&amp;#x200B;

Diet: Lots of pop tarts, peanut butter, cake, etc on top of the daily eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and tendies. 

Routine: Legs, back, chest. Don't really hit shoulders that much. Core mixed into leg day (sometimes). 1 day off a week. 

Going forward: up the intensity on leg day. For sure feel that I can put a few more pounds on my legs pretty easily to pick me up to 200. If I can clean up my diet but then again pop tarts taste good so probably not. Mixing in some cardio will also be nice but I like doing that from sports which are currently shut down. I May go back into rowing if I can get on the water but that won't be for a month or two. Current lifting goals are 5 plate deadlift, 4 plate squat, 3 plate bench press. Hopefully by end of summer.

,gainit,"Hello all,

I'm currently on 5/3/1, and I did one day so far. I have DL and OHP today.

I was curious about the % of TMax it has you do. For the % it has to start at 40%. I cut that out, because that's barely a warmup. 

It gets as high as 85% TMax for 1xAMRAP with a minimum of 5. For squats, that was tough, but I banged out 7. I think Squats, it worked well, absolutely killed me. 

For Bench, it was almost too easy. Sure, I felt the burn, but banging them out was way too easy. For the 85% AMRAP, I did 11. Should I increase my TMAX or retest my 1RM? I thought it was accurate, but maybe it's not. 

We'll see how DL goes today. My max DL is 425, and I've been doing 3x5 of 365lb. Switching to this, I'm worried it'll be too easy, and at the EOM when I HOPE to have added 25lb to my lifts, I'm worried, it won't have increased as much as it could.

So, my question is:

Should I increase my TMax or %'s, or will 5/3/1 in this fashion, following the plan, actually increase my 1RM, because if I had to guess going by my bench, I'd say no.

I don't want to go on a bulk diet and then go for a cut. I will be happy if my muscles build slowly over time. I am not aiming for a bodybuilder look. Just want to look lean.

,gainit,"Hey folks, what with gyms being sporadically shut down every few months because of the pandemic, I'm sure a lot of you have a fairly solid plan b at home to keep the gain train rolling during lockdowns.

I'm no exception. I developed a workout, named ""death by pullups"" that I like to do on one of my pull days during the week. It added notable width to my lats in 10 weeks and I got way stronger at hauling my body vertically through space.

A few caveats to this: 

×I recommend warming your shoulders up extremely thoroughly prior to each time you do this. Scap depressions on a pull up bar, band pullaparts, low intensity band assisted pullups. Whatever you need to do.

×Run this progression linearly for maybe 8 weeks, then take a break. Do something else for your back work for a month. Then go back to it if you like. This can be stressful on the forearms and could lead to tendonitis of you do it for too long. I don't have a multi grip pull up bar at present, I suspect that if one did you could run the workout progression for longer.

*I do not recommend running this if you aren't already quite good at pullups. This is meant as a method to add goals for the intermediate ""puller"" to progress size and strength in a short period of time. Good form is of course a pre requisite, be honest with how you count reps. 

*The volume below may seem daunting. Trust me, if I can do it with very average genetics, you can too . Just remember to work hard and get that one more rep. As the plan dictates that you start with high weight and move down as the reps increase, the CNS is so fired up that the lighter weights seem so much easier even when the muscles are fatigued. 

×I don't recommend doing much else in the gym on the day you run this. Your lats are shattered, your grip is cooked, your bis are sautéed. 

Test your all out max bodyweight pullups /chinups before your run this. Then again after. I'd be shocked if you honestly don't add 10-12 reps. 


The programme is as follows:

5 rep sets:
-Start off with your weaker grip (overhand/underhand). 
-Pick a weight where the first set is an RPE 8ish
-Try your best to get 5 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, rinse and repeat. 
-If you get all 50 reps, add a small amount of weight next week. 

8 rep sets:
-Go back to your weak grip. 
-Pick a weight where you can get 8 reps, again RPE 8.
-Do 4 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, do 4 sets. 
-if all sets are completed, add a rep to as many sets as you can next time (only increase weight on these sets once you can do sets across with 10 reps). 

Bodyweight:
-You're beginning to see a pattern? 
- 3 sets, 12 reps on weak grip. 
-Rinse, repeat, strong grip. 

Band assisted 
-1 burnout set with your weak grip. 
-1 burnout set with your strong grip. 

You're done. Leave the gym. 

It's simple, it's hard, it's not terribly fun but it gets results. I went from bodyweight+25kg for 5 rep max sets on chinups to adding 37.5kg.

The idea was to add +1 rep per set until i hit 8 reps for my first set, then increase the weight and do a amrap, but i just realised that going up  a weight puts my reps to like 4 for the first set, not sure if too low. Also my bench has been stuck at 7 reps for two weeks.

Been messing around I’m the gym for about a year (3 x 30min sessions a week, machines / cables) and have actually seen nice progress with my body.

However, feel i could genuinely look about 3 times better if I took it more seriously e.g. 4 hours a week and did proper compound lifts with free-weights.

But, I’m not going to lie, the free-weight section intimidates me a bit. I was thinking I could ask a PT to do a few sessions with me to ‘ease me in’. But wouldn’t want to (read: can’t afford) to continue. Would they do this? And even worth it in your opinion? Could help psychologically, but also in terms of doing the actual exercises properly. Or should I just stop being a p__sy?

My current routine is chest+back/rest/arms+legs+shoulders/rest/repeat. 

Do higher volume and I like to do one drop set per muscle group at the end of every workout, I like the pump and the burn and the control with the lower weight at the end..... 

 My chest and back day consists of 4 compound movements each, 4x pushing 4xpulling. At the last exercise of chest and back I strip the weight off and do drop sets. So the volume and the stress on the muscle is fairly high. Then 48 hours later when I train arms, I have two exercises for bicep and two for tricep, on the second exercise, again, I do drop sets. 

That means arms are getting hit with pretty high volume every other day. 

I like that routine, but sometimes I think if I would just do push/pull, each arm muscle would have 4 days of rest, vs 48 hours, getting hit directly and indirectly all the time.

,gainit,"Hey!

Since quarantine/lockdown keeps getting extended I'm finally deciding on getting some adjustable dumbells for bulking up! I currently have a bench with a 7kg barbell and some light plates, but it's all outside in my open garage and we've just had our first snowy weather come through. This has resulted in the weather being below at least -1 degrees Celcius which is simply too cold for me to even bother working out. The stuff is also some old rusty stuff from my dad's past job that we picked up.

I'm severely underweight, (18 years old, 183cm/46kg), and I don't have space for a squat rack inside our home. Therefore I thought, that a pair of adjustable dumbells would be good enough for a 6-day ppl routine while staying at home. Is that true?

I live in Denmark/Europe and I'm willing to pay whatever price for them as long as they are the best I can get. I don't care about the cost as long as they are able to get me from my current weight and up +10kg at least if lockdown keeps going for long enough! I've already trained 1 year before but an eating disorder hit me and I lost from 64kg (March 2020, lockdown start) to my current weight of 46kg (This date).

I also have a bench that is kinda old, but it goes from decline to 90 degrees with a removable lock mechanism.

Any folks here have any suggestions on whether this sounds like a reasonable number for such a plan? Or recs on which calculator to follow. I realise they&amp;#39;re all estimates but they vary so much, it&amp;#39;s confusing. For example, the TDEE calculator suggests  I take over 2700.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve bulked in the past but I wasn&amp;#39;t careful and always gained ridiculously amounts of fat instead of muscle gains or strength so I&amp;#39;m looking to take it really careful this time after having trimmed down hard.
Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

With quarantine round 2 happening its given me time to reassess where i’m at and I figure it’s a good time to plot my plan for when gyms reopen to stop fucking around since this time off from the gym has made me reflect on my gainit goals and given me all the motivation to grind hard for it when they reopen.

I’ve just been spending quarantine eating at a maintenance calorie wise with high protein to try and preserve the bit of muscle I have built over the years while doing some resistance band stuff. But when I can get back into my gym and have access to actual decent gym equipment (which should be soon), i’d love some advice on any routines you can recommend and any other advice for gaining hypertrophy. 

My focus for the next year at least is to try and put on some serious size and I definitely am focused on hypertrophy since my goal is primarily (and pretty much exclusively) aesthetics. Prior to this most recent lockdown in my area I had 4 months of gym time and I was doing a 4 day split made for me by an online trainer and I was making some decent progress on that. Just trying to debate whether I continue on that once my gym reopens or if I should switch to a program that any of you with similar goals to me have had great success with. 

I find I tend to get a bit of analysis paralysis when it comes to routines and customizing them to my goals or areas where i'm lacking so I could definitely use some advice there. Also, how long should someone stay on a specific routine for? Sometimes I see people say no longer than 12 weeks, othertimes it's when you stop progressing.

,gainit,"Hi,

So, I've been bulking since the start of the year and I've gone from 152 lbs to 156 lbs over the past month. Over the past week my lifts haven't been going up. Rather than feeling fresh, I feel tired and sore when going into a workout.

Currently, I am eating between 2600-2800 cals a day. I am 25 years old, 156 lb and 6'2. At 152 lbs I was 7.1 % bf, but I don't know about now. I eat over 200 grams of protein a day.

I've been gaining on my current calories, just because I only get any exercise when I go to the gym. Otherwise, I am sitting down from the moment I wake-up.

My workout routine is a modified version of the 6-day reddit PPL.

**Push day (A/B):**

4x5-8 Bench press/OHP

3x8-12 OHP/BP

3x8-12 Incline

3x8-12 DB press

3x8 Skullcrushers ss w/ lat raises

3x8-12 tricep extension machine ss w/ lat raises

**Pull Day:**

3x8-12 Pullups 

4x5-10 Pendlay row 

3x8-12 Wide pulldowns

3x8-12 Chest supported row

4x8-12 Face Pulls ss w/ barbell curls

4x8-12 DB preacher curls

**Leg day:**

70 Bw squats

4x8-12 BB Squats

4x8-12 Stiff legged Deadlifts

3x8-12 burpees as high as possible

&amp;#x200B;

Every other day I hit abs, with 3xmax leg raises followed by 4x8-12 cable crunches.

Right now I can do bench for 125x7, squats for 135x12, deadlifts for 205x12

**Is that too much volume, or are my calories just too low? I am confused, because I've been gaining weight and I can see a physical difference, but my lifts have not been progressing. My cals seem rather low, when I compare my calories to other's bulking cals.**

I'd prefer to keep up with the volume, because I really look forward to going to the gym. The only thing that is sucky is that I am not progressing in the weights I've been doing, and I am sore before starting a workout.

Do you guys think I should make some changes, or keep chugging as is and hope my body's ability to recover catches up?",t2_35c4i7my,False,,0,False,Not Recovering: Is my workout volume too high or are my calories too low?,[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lbgqn9,False,dark,0.87,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1612359656.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;ve been bulking since the start of the year and I&amp;#39;ve gone from 152 lbs to 156 lbs over the past month. Over the past week my lifts haven&amp;#39;t been going up. Rather than feeling fresh, I feel tired and sore when going into a workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am eating between 2600-2800 cals a day. I am 25 years old, 156 lb and 6&amp;#39;2. At 152 lbs I was 7.1 % bf, but I don&amp;#39;t know about now. I eat over 200 grams of protein a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been gaining on my current calories, just because I only get any exercise when I go to the gym. Otherwise, I am sitting down from the moment I wake-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My workout routine is a modified version of the 6-day reddit PPL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push day (A/B):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x5-8 Bench press/OHP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 OHP/BP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Incline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 DB press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8 Skullcrushers ss w/ lat raises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 tricep extension machine ss w/ lat raises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull Day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Pullups &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x5-10 Pendlay row &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Wide pulldowns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Chest supported row&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8-12 Face Pulls ss w/ barbell curls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8-12 DB preacher curls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leg day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70 Bw squats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8-12 BB Squats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8-12 Stiff legged Deadlifts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 burpees as high as possible&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every other day I hit abs, with 3xmax leg raises followed by 4x8-12 cable crunches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I can do bench for 125x7, squats for 135x12, deadlifts for 205x12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that too much volume, or are my calories just too low?

I will list my shit, and at the bottom i will write a couple of questions. Also i tried to format it nice, so u can read it better. I hope this helps.

Okay so im **6'5""** and i started to really eat way more like 3 months ago. Since then ive gained like 10 pounds, so now im at **175lbs**. I believe these are called noob gains tho. 


**My diet:**


My Tdee should be somewhere around 3000 and i pretty much eat somewhere around 4000kcal every single day.

These consists of:

600 oat cereals


700 pbj


600 for a snack (burritos, walnuts, or egg sandwiches)


700 for dinner (most of the time i eat rice or pasta with some extra shit like beans or turkey and some vegetables)


1200 shake with oats, banana, ice cream, milk, chia seeds and olive oil



I think this is considered a dirty bulk. 



**My workout:**

Its kinda scuffed i think. Due to lockdown i train at home, but i train 6 days of the week. I am doing low intensity and high rep workouts, as i only have 2 dumbbells, each with 22pounds. My routine is to start Monday with workout A, then B, then A, then B, then A, then B, then rest.





**Workout A:**

4x 25 pushups


4x 15 bicep curls


4x 15 dumbbell benchpress on the ground (22lbs each)


4x 6 shoulder dumbbell shoulder raises (22lbs each)


4x 15 dumbbell rows (22lbs each)


4x 15 weighted bench dips (44lbs on thighs)


**Workout B:**

4x 15 weighted squads (22lbs on each shoulder)


4x 15 sumo deadlifts (44lbs)


4x 15 romanian deadlifts (44lbs)


4x 15 (per leg) weighted bulgarian split squads, (22lbs)


4x 15 lying hamstring curls (22lbs)



On all days im doing 3 kinds of planks 3 times for 30 seconds






**So my questions are:**

1. how good is my diet, and do i have to eat more after gaining some weight?
2. how is my workout, and how far will low weights get me?
3. is gaining around 15pounds in the next 6 months a realistic goal?

,gainit,"Hey all, 

Been lifting hard for 7 months since July 1st. June of '19 to July of '20 was basically just cutting and running to lose weight. 

Dropped to 189lb, and was ready to physically start packing on muscle. So I ate at 500cal surplus, dropped to a 250kcal surplus, then went back, when I realized that ""hey... I need to eat more food"".

At a 3,250kcal intake right now. Usually get slighty above that, just make sure to never be below it. 

Strength gains definitely saw an increase after the increase food. 

My 1RMs are currently:

Bench: 215lb - Definitely my weakest lift. I have a training weight of 160lb for 4x8. I could definitely be doing better, but it's my first year lifting so whatever. 

Squat: 280lb - This is just a guess, since my training weight is 245lb for 5x5. I don't generally lift for strength, just hypertrophy. This and DL are there to make me stronger. I'm scared to try a 1RM for squat. Which is silly, because I have my safety rails right there.

EDIT: 1RMed the other day at 335. Super happy.

Dead Lift: 425lb - This, while not as amazing as it could be, is my strongest lift. I definitely had more progress on DL than anything else, and I love doing it. Currently, my training weight is 365lb for 3x5, and my 425lb was a very wobbly lift, but I got it up. Started using a belt recently. Made a huge difference.

As the title says my 14YO started lifting in our home gym recently. We are all for it, it's great.

However I'm a bit concerned with his repeated requests for different supplements. First it started with protein powder which we had no problem with, then witamins, fish oil - which was fine as well. EDIT - the supplements I mentioned above I'm totally fine with. Those below worry me a bit. 

However now he's asking for creatine and caffeine because he 'needs energy when doing his morning workout'. For the time being we said no to that. He claims that he's done all the research, however I wanted a second opinion.

On top of that there's a niggling thought in the back of my mind saying: 'he's trying to solve every problem he has with a supplement'.

Are we just being overprotective or is this a legit concern.

I recently maxed my deadlift at 425lb and my bench at 215lb. 

Today, I hit 335lb for squat. That puts me only 25lb away from joining the 1000lb club at my gym. Pretty good for 7 months of lifting.


Until today, I have been primary lifting for hypertrophy. However, I have one month left until I start my cut. 8 months of bulking is enough for now.

I would like to hit that extra 25lb between now and the end of the month, which means focusing my lifts and eating on strength gains. 

First, is it possible to add that last 25lb in one month? Second, on top of a three day strength program, should I add another 500kcal to my daily diet?

I'm at a surplus of 500kcal right now and eating 3,250 ATM. This would put me at 3750.

PERSONAL INFO:

\[Been gaining for about 4 months. Canadian. 21 y/o Male. Started in November 2020 at 132 lbs/6'2"", minimal exercise. Started by going for about 2500 cals per day, plus daily bicep curls with bags of flour (essentially 40lb barbell curls), pushups and situps. Currently in January 2020 I'm at 145 lbs, getting about 2800 cals per day. I invested in a 22.5 lb dumbell and a door chinup bar which are sweet as fuck. Nowadays, my workouts are sporadically made up of 70-rep sets of pushups (diamond/full form/reduced progressively), chinups, wide-grip pullups, self-weighted chest presses, etc. Happy with my workout routine, nothing to complain about there.\]

Okay, now to the main question/issue:

I've been trying to find ways to consume more of my calorie carb split (I do 35 prot 35 fat 30 carb) as complex/low GI carbs, since I find that the simple stuff (maltodextrin-heavy mass gainer shakes) makes me really lethargic when I consume it in high doses (plus I'm prone to prediabetes so I wanna avoid that y'know). Issue is, all the complex carbs I try to consume in the same amount as the simple ones are just so fucking tiring to eat. Like a solid hour of eating oats, or lentils, or brown rice, like jesus christ it's so slow. I think the fibre just makes it so time consuming to eat, and yeah it might be more healthy but fuck. Also it fills me up which makes eating more hard since I have GERD/acid reflux. lol.

Also, I don't wanna be eating like 400% of my daily fibre and having rock solid shits every few hours.

,gainit,"Disclaimer:  Even though my opinion doesn't matter, I am going to give it to you anyway.  I'm not some record breaker or an overly successful entrepreneur.  I'm just some dude next door that lifts.

Are you a goal-oriented lifter?  Sure you are, you plan your training in advance and probably have a specific way to make sure you're recovering enough e.g. calories, macros, sleep.  The first thing we should ask ourselves in the gym is why are we doing this?  If it does not serve a specific purpose then discard it, Jim Wendler taught me that, but he also taught me AMRAPs, but what purpose do they serve?

AMRAPs serve 2 purposes that I can think of: To do the exercise to complete exhaustion and to measure a repetition max.  I will be focusing on the first one, as going for a rep PR is testing, and training is different than demonstrating. I spent a solid year testing my lifts all of the time and seeing what I could put up instead of lifting what I KNOW I could put up.  This resulted in negative progress and it's a lesson you don't have to learn the hard way, I already did that for you.  

So we are taking a movement to at least technical failure, which is usually done on the last set of an exercise., but how often are you doing that?  Every week?  Every workout? At the end of every exercise?    There are clear benefits we get from training to failure, but you should ask yourself if the pros outweigh the cons.  You will benefit similarly by training close to failure, but it won't cost you as much.  Say you AMRAP the last set of your first exercise in the gym, what do you think that costs?  What did it cost today?  What about the rest of the week?  How many sets or reps did you lose because of it, and likely more importantly, how badly did the quality of the rest of your work suffer?  Well the answer can't be zero or nothing unless it was an isolation movement done at the end of a workout, but I will bring that up later. I want to focus on AMRAPs for compound lifts you do early in training.  If you AMRAP the last set of bench, what happens to your OHP next?  Some people think they're getting away with it, but everything costs something.  

I'd like to get back to goals, and I am an extreme believer in specific goals and specificity in general.  As I mentioned before, you likely have your training written down already, and you know exactly what exercises you will be doing with how many sets logged before you even touch a barbell.  Even if you are using rate of perceived exertion, you have a specific number of reps you want to hit beforehand.  To me, this is undervalued.  Knowing exactly what will be asked of you from the exercise before you approach it is huge; it mentally preps you and tells you the exact amount of effort you will need.  This leads to higher quality sets.  AMRAPs are aimless, you might have an idea of where you'll land, but it's not specific enough, and when things aren't specific enough, they can burden you psychologically. I'm not sure the best way to word it, but if you have trained using AMRAPs I'm sure you know what I mean.  Instead, train with intention, train on purpose, know exactly what you need to ask of yourself so you can do it with intent.  AMRAPs have an unsure element to them, and when you are unsure, then what exactly is your intent?  You are doing something unspecific, you simply cannot have intentions that are specific enough.  This leads to uncertainty.  Training with uncertainty introduces doubt, which is EXTREMELY self-destructive. Doubt is to the soul what pain is to the body.  Set a very specific target and hit it EVERYTIME.  Prescribing yourself reps and hitting all of those reps builds confidence, so you won't have a good reason to doubt yourself.  Your body can only do what your mind tells it to, so train that too.

There is a secret great goal setters have, they know exactly what they want, when they want it, and how they're going to get there.  Saying ""I  want to gain weight"" is good, but we can do better.  ""I want to gain 15lbs by June"", now THAT puts some iron sights on your m4.  Furthermore, you put more on the line with specificity, you know exactly how to approach it.  You can break it down by the month or even week to get more specific and this holds you more accountable more often, especially with a deadline.

Now is AMRAPing your last set of tricep pushdowns or lateral raises going to damage your recovery enough to matter?  Probably not, but I would still argue that having a more specific purpose in ALL of your training is more beneficial to you psychologically, which is definitely the most overlooked thing when it comes to training in general.  

AMRAPs are fine as a metric, as a way to find a repetition max when you are testing.  I do not think it should be a strength training staple though, I find it to be poor mental hygiene.",t2_fb0wp,False,,0,False,Should AMRAPs be a strength TRAINING staple?,[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_l9e369,False,dark,0.6,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1612134618.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer:  Even though my opinion doesn&amp;#39;t matter, I am going to give it to you anyway.

I spent a solid year testing my lifts all of the time and seeing what I could put up instead of lifting what I KNOW I could put up.  This resulted in negative progress and it&amp;#39;s a lesson you don&amp;#39;t have to learn the hard way, I already did that for you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are taking a movement to at least technical failure, which is usually done on the last set of an exercise., but how often are you doing that?  Every week?  Every workout? At the end of every exercise?    There are clear benefits we get from training to failure, but you should ask yourself if the pros outweigh the cons.  You will benefit similarly by training close to failure, but it won&amp;#39;t cost you as much.  Say you AMRAP the last set of your first exercise in the gym, what do you think that costs?  What did it cost today?  What about the rest of the week?  How many sets or reps did you lose because of it, and likely more importantly, how badly did the quality of the rest of your work suffer?  Well the answer can&amp;#39;t be zero or nothing unless it was an isolation movement done at the end of a workout, but I will bring that up later. I want to focus on AMRAPs for compound lifts you do early in training.  If you AMRAP the last set of bench, what happens to your OHP next?  Some people think they&amp;#39;re getting away with it, but everything costs something.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to get back to goals, and I am an extreme believer in specific goals and specificity in general.  As I mentioned before, you likely have your training written down already, and you know exactly what exercises you will be doing with how many sets logged before you even touch a barbell.  Even if you are using rate of perceived exertion, you have a specific number of reps you want to hit beforehand.  To me, this is undervalued.  Knowing exactly what will be asked of you from the exercise before you approach it is huge; it mentally preps you and tells you the exact amount of effort you will need.  This leads to higher quality sets.  AMRAPs are aimless, you might have an idea of where you&amp;#39;ll land, but it&amp;#39;s not specific enough, and when things aren&amp;#39;t specific enough, they can burden you psychologically. I&amp;#39;m not sure the best way to word it, but if you have trained using AMRAPs I&amp;#39;m sure you know what I mean.  Instead, train with intention, train on purpose, know exactly what you need to ask of yourself so you can do it with intent.  AMRAPs have an unsure element to them, and when you are unsure, then what exactly is your intent?  You are doing something unspecific, you simply cannot have intentions that are specific enough.  This leads to uncertainty.  Training with uncertainty introduces doubt, which is EXTREMELY self-destructive. Doubt is to the soul what pain is to the body.  Set a very specific target and hit it EVERYTIME.  Prescribing yourself reps and hitting all of those reps builds confidence, so you won&amp;#39;t have a good reason to doubt yourself.  Your body can only do what your mind tells it to, so train that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a secret great goal setters have, they know exactly what they want, when they want it, and how they&amp;#39;re going to get there.  Saying &amp;quot;I  want to gain weight&amp;quot; is good, but we can do better.  &amp;quot;I want to gain 15lbs by June&amp;quot;, now THAT puts some iron sights on your m4.  Furthermore, you put more on the line with specificity, you know exactly how to approach it.  You can break it down by the month or even week to get more specific and this holds you more accountable more often, especially with a deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is AMRAPing your last set of tricep pushdowns or lateral raises going to damage your recovery enough to matter?  Probably not, but I would still argue that having a more specific purpose in ALL of your training is more beneficial to you psychologically, which is definitely the most overlooked thing when it comes to training in general.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMRAPs are fine as a metric, as a way to find a repetition max when you are testing.  I do not think it should be a strength training staple though, I find it to be poor mental hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;

Diet
Breakfast- 
2 packs of oatmeal with 2 scoops of peanut butter, 1 whole banana and some apple cinnamon cheerios- roughly 935 calories 
Lunch- 
normally I eat whatever we had the Night before or butter noodles with Swanson chunk chicken- roughly 500 calories 
Supper- 
It varies but most of my meals are homemade so it’s hard to track but usually chicken penne with mixed vegetables 
 Snacks- 
cashews with oikos topped with strawberries , these cookie dough bites and honey 
Calories roughly  600  
I also make a hefty shake with protein powder oats, peanut butter and a banana 
MyFitnessPal is a godsend!

Calories roughly  600&lt;br/&gt;
I also make a hefty shake with protein powder oats, peanut butter and a banana 
MyFitnessPal is a godsend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;———————-/-
I have been slacking off on counting calories ever since the calendar switched over but I have a base that I can work on and I have been happy with my progress &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion- I am not where I want to be but I am extremely happy with my gains! I want to thank y’all for the knowledge to do this!&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hi, hope every is doing well. A while ago I posted a progress update on how I went from 54KG to 72kg over a year. I am now 74kg. And I have been stuck here for a while. Obviously, I know to gain weight and break the plateau, but I simply wonder if it's worth it at all. I am hovering at around 3300 calories to maintain. I naturally don't have a big appetite, I had to discipline and force myself to be where I am at today, but I think I reached my breaking point. 

I simply can't take any more food. But on the other hand, I'm still not satisfied with my physique. Well, mostly. If you remember I also ranted about my legs being the only part not developing on par with my upper body so that's why I kept bulking up at 72kg. I thought I could reach 80 but seems to me now insane with how much food I'd have to chuck to get there. So I suppose my legs have to wait a little more.

Now here is what I was thinking and need your advice on this. I'm thinking of doing a cut to re-adjust my calorie intake. Cut back to 70, 68kg. And slowly re-bulking from there. My first bulk was aggressive and that's why I think my calorie intake is so high right now. So I was thinking if I cut and take things slowly again, my calorie intake would readjust. (Idk if I'm brosciencing this lmao.) 

Either way, current measurements: (for reference point, started with empty bar on everything)

,gainit,"Hi,

I am 23M, height 190cm (6ft 3in), 52kg (115 pounds). My BMI is 14.3 which is severely underweight.

Since last week I have started to focus on my diet and I am keeping an account of calories consumed. I was able to consume 2500+ calories/day and my weight increased from 50kg to 52kg in 7 days.

I have gained this weight on a healthy vegan diet - bananas, rice, tofu, soy milk, nuts, veggies, and seeds. On an average per day, I'm consuming high carbs (simple and complex) in excess of 330g, around 60-80g protein intake, and 38g fiber, 40g fat and 99g of sugar. I take Vitamin B12, D3, Omega-3 DHA supplements daily. 

I have done minimal workout at home for 3 days which included squats, plank exercise (tried push-ups but could not do). I am mostly home these days doing desk job, so not much movement. But I go for a walk after dinner. 

My main goal is to reach a healthy BMI (68 kg) first and then increase my weight to the ideal: 80 kg. I do not want to turn all the food I'm consuming into body fat. Therefore, I would like to join the gym and channelize the protein intake into muscle growth. Since I'm quite skinny, I can see bones protruding from my joints and shoulder. Therefore, I am looking to have solid arms, shoulder and calf muscles, for now. Later on I can work on other parts of my body. 

**What do you suggest should I join the gym immediately or do I bulk up for now, hit the 68kg mark, do minimal workout at home, and then later join the gym once I'm in normal BMI region?**

Greetings, guys

I can see that everyday some of you good folks make really impressive progress and every single one of you has been an inspiration of mine through this process. So, first of all THANK YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

Little backstory,

I used to be really obese, by obese I mean I was around 100kg of pure fat, no exercise, wasn't moving my body at all and spent my entire days in house playing video games as a teen.

Decided that I have to stop my negative habits if I didn't plan to die by 25 of heart disease or diabetes.

Have to admit that it was really tough process losing all of that weight, not that much physically as mentally challenging it was.

Days, weeks, months went by and eventually with all the hard work I lost that weight. I lost around 66lbs if I recall correctly.

And there came the new phase, the new ""SKINNY ME"".

Pretty much, the only thing about being skinny that I liked is that every clothing piece suited me pretty decent in comparison and the fact that I made it to goal that I set for myself.

Being skinny for some time actually brought up that feeling of being really weak, felt really low with libido too. Didn't feel that strong at all.

So, I decided to step up my game and gain some muscle. And, oh boy, I didn't even realize how hard it actually was. Like, the eating part is probably the hardest. Forcing your body to eat and shoving that food up your mouth is really the worst. Peanut butter is life savior in that case tho.

After few months of peanut butter and feeling sick I came to realization that I actually gained pretty decent amount of weight and when I think about it, now I feel really really strong in comparison when I was skinny.

Don't really like that part where I gained a bit of fat, but the fact that I feel a lot stronger and physically better is compensating in that case.

Overall, I'm pretty happy where I'm at right now.

Keep up the good work guys!

I'm 24M, currently 82.9kg as of this morning, 182cm tall. According to a FitTrack scale I own, I currently sit at 17.4% BF. I was I believe around mid 20s% when I first started losing fat. Recently I've been focusing on also building muscle in the last few months.

As of this coming weekend I am at the end of a 5 week cut, eating initially 2000, now down to 1900 cals a day, 180+g protein, under 50g of fat (usually well under), the rest carbs.

I'm very keen to bulk and get bigger. I don't want to come off a cut and instantly put all that fat back on, but I also want to maximise my muscle growth from the time, energy and effort I'm putting into my workout and diet routine.

People's opinions differ hugely on if I can bulk or not. Many say if you're above 15% BF, which I am, then you need to keep cutting. Some say cut, maintain, cut, maintain, until you're below 15%, then again, bulk. Others say a small, lean bulk over a long time can cause body recomposition.

My question is: In my situation, what would you do? Switch into a lean bulk? Keep cutting, and if so, until when?

,gainit,"I am seeing a lot of submissions asking if they should do X if they only have very little weight. While this is not optimal (hate that word, especially for lifting), there are dozens of ways around this.

I usually train with light weights, because I get most of my programming from the 5/3/1 Forever book, and Jim has you base your numbers off of your training max, which is 85% of your 'actual' 1rm. So most of my strength work is around 55-85% of my real 1rm, so it's absurdly light given the rep scheme. This allows me to put a lot of focus into each set and do every rep with intention. I never have the ""let's just get this over with"" attitude, and you won't either if you do your work with intention. Move the bar with a purpose.

**Tempo**
This is my go to; my favorite dance move. I incorporate brief pauses or purposely slow down the eccentric to make the set more challenging. I also like to put a lot of force into the concentric, so if I were to put 20 more pounds on the bar it would still fly up. 

**Rest periods**
Cut them shorter. I was doing 10x5 squats a couple weeks ago and I decided I was going to rest only 30 seconds because it felt very light and I was on my game. I don't use this one as much, because resting let's me visualize the next set and helps me train on purpose. But it's effective and just another form of progressive overload.

**Increase Frequency**
Have you heard of easy strength by dan john? If you don't know who that is then go read about him, he has an old school approach to lifting and is incredibly wise. But easy strength is essentially picking 5 movements and doing them everyday. Ultra high frequency, low intensity and volume. It worked very well for me after I took a hiatus from lifting and returned. 

**Increase volume**
This is an easy fix to low intensity, but I always add a set before increasing reps because it's easier and ensures you're doing more quality work than if you just added a rep to each set. You don't want your 2nd-5th set suffering because you burned yourself out on the first set by jumping the reps too fast.

There are many more approaches to getting stronger/bigger with limited weights such as drop sets or rest:pause, but these are my go tos, and in this specific order.

Will post new photos after I finish this program.

# Back story

I've been skinny my whole life (still am, albeit better than before haha). I'm also in terrible shape (being skinny **does not** equal being fit...and fit I am not...I've gotten sore for days helping a friend move a few moving boxes). It's not that I have an eating disorder or anything, I eat really whatever I want whenever I want to. It's just that ""whenever I want"" seems to be naturally less than most. I don't think about food, I don't crave food...if anything, eating is kind of a nuisance for me. There are countless times I've worked an entire day and have completely forgotten to eat. My friends all ""hate me"" because I ""eat whatever I want"" but in all reality, they're just seeing me at at that moment and not seeing all the other times when I put absolutely zero emphasis on food or making an effort to eat it....I'm just generally not hungry, and when I am, I eat something (""something"" being the operative word, as I don't make an effort to eat either healthy or unhealthy...just ends up being food). I think that's probably my biggest issue (although I didn't know it until I began this whole thing). The reason for saying ""my biggest issue"" is that I've tried gaining muscle (unsuccessfully) a multitude of times throughout my life, all with little to no success. I just assumed I was one of those people who ""can't gain muscle"" and left it at that.

# Why I Began

With the whole pandemic going on, I've been seeing a lot of my face on conference calls and the like. I've had a minor issue with my smile (two teeth are a bit crooked). I figured what better time to get Invisalign than now...I'm not physically at work, when I go out I have to wear a mask, etc. Once I got my trays I thought ""well, what else can I change? I've got to wear these things for 8 months, maybe I can ""tie another goal"" into this one"". I landed on making one last attempt at gaining muscle, but figured I'd go all out (both in researching nutrition and the equipment I'd be using). I figured if after the pandemic is over I can have a nice straight smile and look better physically I could essentially treat the pandemic as my personal ""cocoon"" from which I could emerge a...well, I don't want to call myself a butterfly, but you get the gist yeah?

# Why P90X?

Because I was overwhelmed by all the ""at home lift routines"" and wanted something that I could just simply follow, immediately, and not wonder what to do next.  Also because, probably more importantly, as mentioned previously, I'm in terrible shape. I *wanted* to get straight into a lifting program, but deep down I was pretty damn sure I'd hurt myself almost immediately and that'd be the end of it. I wanted to start with ""Body Beast"" but I figured before starting a lifting regimen I should probably get myself into some sort of shape first. Let my nervous and muscular systems ""learn"" how to work together, learn movements, learn ""form"", etc. Not to mention building some cardiovascular endurance. I've read a LOT about P90X, and while it gets a bad rap from some, it still seemed like overall most people endorse it. Now that I've completed P90X I've moved onto Body Beast.

# Nutrition

I have no problem following a workout program, so I knew that wasn't the crux of my problem (I've followed them religiously in the past and gotten no results...and that lack of results caused me to abandon working out altogether as I relegated myself to the ""permanently skinny club""). I researched a ton and landed on doing a 40/30/30 split (protein/carbs/fat) on about 2300 calories a day. Given my aversion to giving food any amount of effort or time, I needed to make things as simple as possible. So I decided on simply eating the exact same thing, every day, with the exception of dinner (I did make sure that my dinner was always a meat, a starch and a fresh vegetable, but it gave me enough daily variation to have at least one thing different). Every single day my routine went (and is back to going):

* **6:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, quarter cup steel cut oats
* **7:30am** \- workout
* **8:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, 1 cup chocolate milk, 1 egg, 2 slices bread
* **12:00pm** \- 1/2 cup cottage cheese, homemade salad (romaine, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers), homemade tuna salad (on top of the salad, which consisted of tuna, hard boiled eggs, onions, mayonnaise)
* **2:00pm** \- homemade smoothie (1 cup mixed fruit \[strawberries, blueberries, raspberries\], orange juice, 1% milk, 3ozs mixed nuts \[cashews, walnuts, almonds, pecans, brazil nuts\])
* **5:30pm** \- dinner
* **8/9pm** \- 1 scoop casein protein powder

I ate (and am back to eating) that exact thing every single day. Some of my friends think it's crazy and that they could never do that...but as it turns out, my indifference to food actually helps me on this point. Because I don't really care what I'm eating, *I never care what I'm eating.* It makes no difference to me that it's the same thing, every day. If anything, it's easier, because I don't have to think about it. I ""meal prep"" on Sundays (cut/chop everything for a weeks worth of salads, make a weeks worth of tuna salad, pre-make my smoothies and freeze them in foodsaver bags). The only thing I make ""on the fly"" is my dinner each night.

**If you have a look at the graphs in the photo** I linked to in the beginning of the post, you'll see me immediately begin to lose weight after November 31st (which was the date I finished P90X and then stopped eating the above and working out regularly).

# Equipment

I wanted to put a fair amount of money into this, as yet another reason to keep me sticking with things (if I'm going to spend over $1,000 on something, it'll keep me motivated on days where said motivation might otherwise be lacking). I bought a Wyze scale, an adjustable weight bench, smoothie machine, 3 months worth of protein powder, BeachBody subscription, water bottle and two 71.5lb AtivaFit adjustable dumbells.

# How it Went

Well, personally, I'm happy with the outcome. I only missed 4 days of the workout program, but otherwise stuck with it ""as prescribed"". Some interesting and entirely unexpected things happened that I'm quite happy about. My skin looks a thousand times better...a few wrinkles have all but disappeared. I had a few areas of eczema on my leg and face as well, and they have **completely** vanished (and they've plagued me for years...I purchase hydrocortisone cream once every month or so...and it's literally gone without a trace now). To say ""I feel a thousand times better"" would be a massive understatement. My energy levels are through the roof, I sleep like a dead body, my relationship has benefited from it (wink wink)...it's, well, amazing.

# What Next

After the roughly month I took off (and the weight I unintentionally lost during that time) I decided to give ""Body Beast"" a shot, now having more confidence that I wouldn't injure myself almost immediately. I'd like to see if I can get to 180lbs and then cut some fat off...I'm noticing that while gaining muscle, my body fat percentage climbs right along with it so presumable if/when I can get to 180lbs, I'll have a fair amount of fat to shave off at that point.",t2_z73am,False,,0,False,"[Progress] M/35/5'11"" - 136-&gt;157lbs - 3 Months of at Home Workouts",[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_l4y1lz,False,dark,0.97,,public,222,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,222,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1611638893.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 month progress photo (before and after) - &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/5Lx1Nar.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/5Lx1Nar.jpg&lt;/a&gt; .

Squat 1RM: [https://imgur.com/a/w6Znd1o](https://imgur.com/a/w6Znd1o)

Like most people here I wanted to fit into my clothes better and was getting tired of people commenting on how skinny I was. For the past year I've been running a PPL routine that i've put together with some basic research with one rest day per week. I work out in the morning monday-friday and eat right after I get back from the gym. I am trying to find a new routine focused on powerbuilding as I love trying to push Squat, Bench, and Deadlift while continuing to focus on hypertrophy. I started out in my apartments gym and once I felt I needed more resistance after a month I signed up for a gym membership around mid February and then Covid shut down the gym until June. During that time I just focused on doing light cardio work 3-4 times a week.

Food wise i am rough tracking calories by eating a shake in the morning that is just over 1k calories and then 3-4 small meals throughout the day after that consist of a mix of chicken and past egg and tortilla rollups, salmon/veggie burgers and protein oat peanut butter mix throughout the day. When I've tracked calories it comes out to 2800-3000 calories per day. I am planning on cutting around April, but right now I don't mind the excess belly fat.

Shake Recipe every morning is below:

* 2 cups of milk
* half a frozen banana
* 1 scoop chocolate protein
* 3/4 cup of oats
* 4 tablespoons of peanut butter

* Bench 135
* Squat 185
* Deadlift 225

Current

Push day

* Flat Barbell Bench 5 set of 3-5 reps
* Incline Dumbell bench 4 sets 8-12 reps
* flat bench close grip bench 4 sets 8-12 reps
* Tricep push downs 4 sets 8-12 reps
* Cable flys 3 x8 low 3x8 high
* diamond pushups to failure 3 sets \*dips 3 sets to failure mix between chest and tricep focus

Pull

* Deadlift 5 set 3-5 reps
* Lat Pull down 4 sets 8-12
* bentover barbell rows
* preacher curls 4x8 or 21's x 3

,gainit,"Hey everyone, sorry if this post gets a little long. 

So basically, I've been working out for about 5 years now, and I don't look it. I'm a PT student so I have a lot of knowledge, good nutrition, consistency, etc. but one major roadblock throughout the entirety of my training has been form. 

I can recognize good/bad form in others, but I am horrible about it when it comes to myself. I can't see myself from all angles, so it's hard to focus on when I'm actually in the gym, but sometimes when the gym is empty I will set up my phone as a camera to check. 

I did that the other day as I hit some DLs, and upon review my back curved A LOT (this explains my recent back pain). Now I'm upset because all the progress I thought I made (finally hit a 1rm of &gt;300) was made with sloppy form. Back to 135 again, I guess. This has happened several times. 

I have decided to do nightly stretches and exercises to strengthen my hip flexors, but one thing has been bugging me. I want to bulk, because after all these years I'm still 185 lbs at ~16% bf. But I can't bulk with bad form...and I cant drop weights and expect to put on muscle either. So...

Do I drop the weight on key lifts for now, and go heavy on isolation exercises where my form is better? Do I drop weights, and get lean while I focus on form? Or do I maintain until I have my form perfected? I'm at an impasse and tired of spinning my wheels. 

Any advice or encouragement is appreciated. Fitness is my passion but I'm still pretty bad at it.

Hey y'all, back with a 2nd year update. 30 lbs gain in 2 years, def not all muscle but super happy about my progress. Recap: I've struggled with being under weight and having a myriad of GI issues for my entire adult life. I had never weighed above 130 lbs. Only recently have my eating habits felt ""normal"" and holy moly what have I been missing the past 15 years of my life. For the first time \*ever\* I finally feel ... right/normal. I can actually eat a full plate without feeling or needing to throw up. I have enough energy to make it through the day. I don't have to fight off dozing off during work or while driving. I'm not sure exactly what clicked after 28 years, but I know I started consistently working out 2 year ago and other aspects of my health and especially my GI issues started improving drastically.

DIET:

I don't follow a diet plan other then eating somewhat healthy and eating a complete breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. Again, being able to eat more then a bowl of cereal in a day without feeling full is a new experience for me so I honestly just try and eat as much as I can.

ROUTINE:

I \*had\* been hitting the gym 4 days a week generally doing a variation of PPL and little cardio, but since the pandemic I've been doing what I can in my garage ""gym"" - I have an adjustable dumbell set that's done a admirable job. I still get in 45 mins or exercise everyday and tend to stick to a ""at home"" variation of ppl

Because of life, there have been many days where I don’t even come close to my daily goal, but despite that I’m gaining at a good pace and I don’t really understand how or why.

On an ideal day I eat 3 meals and drink my shake that rounds out to about 990 calories with rarely any snacking throughout the day.

Mornings are usually 3-4 eggs, toast, with some variation of a side , then I make my shake which I drink throughout the next few hours. Lunch has typically been a double wrap burrito from chipotle at LEAST 3 times a week. It’s expensive but hopefully it’s paying off. Dinner is whatever my mom makes, which I appreciate since I’m busy with school. It’s honestly hard to keep track of my calories for things like homemade food not prepared by me, but I typically stuff myself with whatever food is there and hope for the best which you will probably flame me for, but it seems to be working so far. I also drink half a gallon of water throughout the day and that’s it.

As I’ve mentioned there are just days where I simply don’t get it done. It’s usually the weekends, where I have a time commitment from the very early morning to almost mid afternoon. I eat breakfast (Bacon Egg and Cheese + Coffee from Dunkin’) those days, and will probably eat a late lunch (Moes or Chipotle) after I’m done with my obligations. But by the time I get home on weekends (after legs on Saturday especially) I find myself having been too tired to go and make my shake/figure out dinner. I just shower and crash until the next day. Let’s assume I get 1600 calories on those weekend days from my two meals.

Sorry for rambling, but my main question revolves around whether or not the “calorie goal” is as strict as people make it seem. Is there supposed to be room for error? I figured when people stress the daily aspect, it’s for a reason.

On average I may have 4 great days of eating a week, one solid, and two where I know I didn’t eat enough. Despite that though, I’ve had gained steadily.

,gainit,"This topic comes up all the time, but evidently it needs to be repeated again:

**YOU MUST DO CARDIO.**

Cardio &amp; Conditioning Work is not optional, and it's not a suggestion. It's a MUST-DO. This is a non-negotiable.

- ""But I'm only trying to build muscle, I have no interest in building endurance""...

- ""I'm already a hard-gainer as it is. I don't want to burn the additional calories""...

- ""I just don't have time to do cardio, it's boring; I mean really, really boring"" etc.

Have you ever said any of these things? These are the most common excuses for skipping cardio &amp; conditioning.

Never mind the manifold health benefits for cardio. Never mind the fact it can help boost appetite significantly. 

Let's look at this instead through the lens of this metaphor: YOUR BODY IS AN ENGINE. (Well, *you* are the *vehicle,* and your muscles are the engine, rather). You are much like a finely-tuned machine that creates movement and work. And how does a motor accomplish this? It's the pistons firing up &amp; down that drive the transmission, which translates into rotation of the wheels. We all understand that the force of the internal combustion engine is what moves the car or truck along. Are you with me so far?

Well, how would you build a stronger engine, an engine with more torque or more horsepower? The fastest route is through a simple increase in DISPLACEMENT. (I say ""simple"", but it's anything but that. It requires a great deal of machining to do this. Honestly, it would be faster to just swap out engines altogether. But I digress). So what would that look like? You would bore out each of the cylinders to a larger diameter, and swap out the pistons with larger ones. In a nutshell, you would increase the total cubic inches of volume wherein the combustion happens. Does that make sense?

*More displacement equals more fuel/air mixture equals bigger boom equals more force.*

In a limited sense, this would be a way to achieve ""engine hypertrophy"". You make a bigger engine.

But in practice, can you do (only) this? Can you simply make your internal combustion chamber larger and have it work?

**NO.** No it's not enough to have a larger engine block. And why is this? Because there's a host of other mechanical mechanisms that also need to be in place to support an increase in displacement. You would also want to re-machine the valve openings and install larger valves (to let fuel in, and let exhaust out more rapidly). The engine would also require larger diameter intake &amp; exhaust manifolds. It would also likely require a higher-flow fuel pump. It would also overheat easier, which would necessitate a more robust cooling system (higher pressure &amp; higher volume of engine coolant) etc.

All these requirements are based on the fact that a larger combustion process requires more air to match the increase in gasoline which fuels the process. A larger engine also results in a higher volume of exhaust gases after the explosion. The combustion of a larger engine runs hotter, which means the cooling requirements are greater. The whole point of this allegory is YOU CAN'T SIMPLY MAKE A LARGER ENGINE. All the supporting systems will need to be upgraded too.

Again, this is just a metaphor. But the thrust of my post is thus: *If you build bigger muscles through lifting, you're also going to need to upgrade your supporting physiological processes!* So stop thinking of ""cardio"" as for ""endurance"" only. Instead, envision cardio as HELPING YOUR MUSCLES **BREATHE.** Your ability to lift a meaningful volume of challenging sets within a reasonable time depends on your muscles ability to get adequate fuel, to dispose of metabolic wastes efficiently, and to oxygenate all of the tissues that are involved in performing the lift itself.

Is resistance-training enough to improve your resistance training? No, it's not. Lifting in &amp; of itself doesn't burn a ton of calories, and it doesn't really ramp up mitochondrial activity. Supplemental cardio &amp; conditioning work will increase your total energy in the gym. It will make higher-rep sets easier to hit. It will help you be ready for the next set sooner. It will reduce muscle soreness in the days following each session. It will help get glycogen &amp; nutrients back into the muscle and tendon, to repair them faster and more efficiently. It will increase insulin sensitivity significantly etc. etc.

If you're bulking in a massing phase, you should be doing even *more* cardio than when you're cutting!

If you want to minimize fat accumulation on a bulk, you need to be doing more cardio &amp; conditioning!

If you're having difficulty recovering, but you're eating &amp; sleeping enough, you likely need more cardio!

Cardio/Conditioning can be as simple as adding a couple of brisk walks every single day. Two 10-minute walks are quick, easy, require no special equipment, and can be done right outside your front door. You don't need to suit up, drive to the gym, and sweat out on a stairclimber for an hour (unless you enjoy that!). Simply add brisk walks a couple times per day, every day. If you ever feel drowsy after a big meal, go for a walk. It tends to energize you, and pick you right back up.

Another favorite of mine is skipping rope. For a small investment ($12-15 bucks), you can get a jump rope and skip for 5-10 minutes per day (this is in addition to the brisk walking). I like intervals (skip for 20 seconds, pause for 10 seconds, repeat). Or shoot for a total number (100 skips, 500 skips, whatever). Just get better at it, and build up volume over time. A little bit every day, every other day, adds nothing to your allostatic load. It's not really fatiguing whatsoever.

What else can be done with little/no equipment? HILL SPRINTS. (Find a hill, run up it, walk back down, sprint back up. Repeat a few times). The goal with the heavier conditioning like this is to get winded; you *want* to get out of breathe, and continue to keep pushing into it. If you have a backpack, you can fill it with books and/or a couple dumbbells, and walk with that for distance, hopefully uphill! Wrap those weights in a blanket or pillow, and walk for 30-45 minutes. A canvas bag can also be purchased for little cost, and filled with sandbags. This can be used for front carries etc.

Look, I know cardio is additional work. But if you want to make the most of a bulking phase, ADD CARDIO.

Just move more every day, and make a point of getting winded/gassed/totally-out-of-breath a couple times per week.

Your total energy will go up, your focus &amp; attention will improve, your gym aggression and recovery will increase.

There's like 20 different reasons to add cardio/conditioning work, but I can't think of a single reason NOT to.

,gainit,"So I've just reached the 1 year progress point and thought I'd post on reddit which has been my main place for motivation and advice. I haven't made major progress but I'm happy with where I'm at.

I haven't been to the gym once since I started my fitness journey. At the start I just wanted to do some home workouts with dumbbells and build a foundation to then go to the gym, but then the pandemic came. Because of this I have never done any barbell lifts and I haven't attempted a pull up ever. I can't get a pull up bar as I am too afraid of damaging the door frames in my rented apartment.

# Before and After Pictures

1 Year progress, going from 155lbs to around 175lbs at the moment. Height is around 6'2"".

# Training

I started out with a dumbbell full body workout that I found on Simeon Panda's YouTube that had some basic exercises that consisted of:

* **Pushups, Bent Over Rows, Bicep Curls, Tricep Kickbacks, Overhead Press, Squats, Stiff-Legged Deadlift, Leg Raises**

In the beginning I couldn't do one push up and used very light weights, doing 2 sets of 8-12 reps. After a month or two I started doing 3 sets. I would do this workout whenever I felt like it, sometimes everyday for a week and other times just once or twice a week.

After a few months of that I progressed into a PPL dumbbell split that I've been doing ever since. My dumbbells only go up to 45lbs so I can't do anything crazy.

Dumbbell PPL Routine:

***Chest, Shoulders &amp; Triceps***

* **Pushups / Floor Press - 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps**

I do a version of that ab workout every day or two with some variations now and then. Admittedly I've skipped a lot of leg days, they are just not as enjoyable as the upper body days. Maybe once I get under the squat rack I'll enjoy them more.

Now I can do around 15-20 pushups in one set and feel much more comfortable doing them. I add weight to the dumbbells each week to try and make progress but it's hard since I only have a limited amount of weight to add.

# Diet

When I started working out I had just started learning how to cook so I was having 3 meals everyday and probably getting around 2500 calories in most days. I bought a mass gainer powder that I'd have 3 scoops of with 700-800ml of milk after a workout.

As for my diet right now, I try to get in 3000-4000 calories. I succeed most days but its not always the cleanest food. I usually get between 120-180g of protein. For breakfast I have 3 Weetabix with chocolate soya milk, a banana and a glass of fruit juice every morning, around 700kcal. My lunches vary. I was making a green smoothie with fruit juice, an avocado, spinach and peanut butter that was around 700kcal but it was too expensive so I've stopped making it. I'll usually have a sandwich and a couple clementine's or Baked beans on toast, lets say 500kcal. Dinner is usually around 800-900kcal, my go to meals are Tuna pasta, Chicken fried rice with chicken breast and 2 eggs, Beef burgers, Chicken breast with a sauce, rice and broccoli, etc. About 30 minutes to an hour after my dinner I'll have a protein smoothie that's around 700-800kcal. 400ml milk, 1 banana, 1 or 2 tbsp. of peanut butter, 1tsp. Nutella, 1 scoop whey protein. Around 10 or 11pm I'll have something else to eat, usually another sandwich or a couple pb&amp;j sandwiches. That's about all I eat + some other snacks and unhealthy foods in-between. I'm going to start having a glass of whole milk with my lunch and later meal to get some more calories in. I definitely have more space to eat as I have a big appetite it's just I don't really enjoy eating and don't know what to eat without being super unhealthy.

I don't take any supplements or creatine, except protein powder.

Hopefully the world returns to normal soon and I can make some real gains in the gym. I'm pleased with the progress I've made though and hope to continue gaining weight this year.

,gainit,I'm a 5'5 123 lb M. About 8-9 lbs gain was the belly fat I gained during the quarantine and now I have around 20-25% body fat lol.

And this is what I’ve been eating this week:

I wake up at 5 and do my workout/attempted yoga and meditation for my mind. Finish somewhere around 6:30 for the lot.

Then I have my breakfast at about 8ish after getting to work:

Berroca + 1 pint/1L of water.
60g mornflake oats
Crave dale full fat milk 250ml
1 tbsp peanut butter KP
1 tsp honey
1 black coffee
Multivitamin

Then at about 12-1ish I have lunch.

This week it’s been:
100g basmati white rice
25g baked oven crisps
1 Pepsi max 
1 wagon wheel
1 tbsp Nando’s Perinase 
50-100gram tenderstem broccoli 
100g green beans
350g chicken breast

Dinner varies as other people in my family eat differently but an example meal would be:

4 Thick pork sausages
100g peas 
400g mash
150ml gravy

Snacks
50g Bombay mix
1 apple 
1 banana 

I’m have about 3L water a day (hopefully)

,gainit,"Hello,

I (18M 5’10.5” 148lb) have been currently trying to bulk since mid-late December. My routine is usually as follows:

Monday: Pull day

Tuesday: HIIT workout

Wednesday : Leg day

Thursday: Running if possible

Friday: Push day

Saturday: HIIT workout 

Sunday: Indoor cycle if possible 

(On my running days, I do interval sprints for 45 minutes-1 hour or so. On cycle days, it’s about the same. On HIIT workouts, it’s usually a 35 or 40 minute workout from Fitness Blender.)

My main question is: am I doing too much cardio that ruins my muscle growth? I go as hard as possible on lifting days, so that’s not a problem. However, (especially with running), I feel that I do too much cardio and it’s ruining my gains. I also try to eat more calories than I burn and usually eat chicken, pasta, steak, fish, and other high-protein foods in my meals, as well as a protein bar, frozen fruit protein shake, a banana, a mandarin, and a spinach salad with eggs, bacon, and eggs everyday.

&lt;p&gt;Decline Press 4x8-12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incline Press 4x8-12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chest Flies Machine 4x8-12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iso lateral wide chest (machine?) 4x8-12&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Greetings Once Again Gainers,

Like many of you gainers, I work an office job in front of a computer at a desk that has minimal physical demand and lots of sitting.  This allows for unique opportunities for gaining, IF one is willing to take a few unique actions in order to maximize the potential contained within.  I wanted to share some tips I’ve picked up along the way so that you can make the most of your situation.  This should work for those of you that are stuck in an office OR for those of you that are full time students, but even those of you with less sedentary lifestyles may be able to pick something up from it.

---

**THINGS TO BUY** 

* INSULATED LUNCHBOX.  Having a way to bring food to the office is key to ensuring you have food to eat.  You don’t want to eat out for every meal, as it’s costly and you have minimal control over food quality.  You also run the risk of losing your parking space if you leave for lunch.  AND, if you bring food, you don’t run the risk of working through lunch, which is typical for you workaholics.  My wife bought me [this one]( https://www.amazon.com/Performa-Punisher-MealPrep-Bag-Accommodate/dp/B077GRQFQN/ref=sr_1_35?dchild=1&amp;keywords=punisher+insulated+lunch+box&amp;qid=1611162229&amp;sr=8-35) for my birthday, and it’s really awesome, but you can get something simple.  The other benefit of having your own lunchbox is you can keep your food in it and next to you vs using the office communal fridge, which prevents food thieves from eating your lunch and leaving you hungry.  And, of course, I keep writing “lunch”, but in truth, I pack a LOT of food for work.  I literally eat something every hour that I’m at work, and that lunchbox goes a long way to ensure that I have enough food to get me through my shift.

* STAINLESS STEEL WATER BOTTLE.  I like a [half gallon size]( https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Bottle-AOZEX-Insulated-Leakproof/dp/B085S6M2TR/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3QOFYWV32ZGIW&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=stainless+steel+half+gallon+water+bottle&amp;qid=1611162464&amp;sprefix=stainless+steel+half+gall%2Caps%2C179&amp;sr=8-8) like that one.  If you’re gaining, you’re eating a lot of protein.  Protein, as a macronutrient, requires more water for digestion than any other macronutrient.  It’s why most “survival food” has minimal protein in it and much more fats and carbs.  But you don’t run the risk of dying of dehydration in an office IF you’re keeping hydrated.  The other perk about drinking a lot of water while working is that it will force you to get up more frequently so that you can go use the bathroom, which can prevent the maladies associated with remaining in a seated position for so long.  I aim to fill and drink this 3 times in a shift, getting in 6 liters of water a day.  Oh yeah, and steel tends to have less toxins associated with it compared to drinking from plastic bottles, and this is environmentally friendly compared to junking a bunch of single use plastic bottles, so that’s cool too.

* GLASS FOOD CONTAINERS. [This]( https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Storage-Containers-Piece-Proof/dp/B082SN4QH6/ref=sr_1_4?crid=X03R665LMPQ6&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=glass+storage+containers&amp;qid=1611162677&amp;sprefix=glass%2Caps%2C196&amp;sr=8-4) is the set I have, but there are a ton out there.  That lunchbox I linked came with containers, and I still use them for veggies and sandwiches, but when it comes to food that needs reheating or has sauces/staining elements to it, glass is the way to go. Zapping plastic in the microwave never sits well with me, and if you put something with pasta sauce in a plastic container the stain never gets out.  I also find that food tends to stay fresher in glass containers, which is great if you make things in bulk and eat them throughout the week.  I’ve had leftover last MUCH longer once I switched from tupperwear to glass containers. 

* GRIPPERS.  [Captains of Crush are King]( https://www.amazon.com/IronMind-Captains-Crush-Hand-Gripper/dp/B0094WEFJM/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=captains+of+crush+grippers&amp;qid=1611165376&amp;sr=8-4), but I have heard good things about heavy grippers as well.  These are great toys to have at the office whenever you have some downtime and wanna get in some sort of training.  People tend to neglect their grip a lot in their training, and these dudes will right fix that.  Make no mistake: these aren’t sporting goods store grippers that you’re going to mindlessly click for a million reps: this is a real workout.  

* PLASTIC OR BAMBOO SILVERARE.  If you’re fortunate enough to have your own desk, make sure it has a lot of ready to go silverware in it.  Nothing is worse than packing a whole bunch of food for work and then finding out you have no way of eating it because you forgot to pack THAT.  Consequently, I picked up some [bamboo silverware]( https://www.amazon.com/Bamboo-Utensils-Cutlery-Set-BEWBOW/dp/B07MGVXFWJ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&amp;keywords=bamboo+silverware&amp;qid=1611162990&amp;sr=8-9) that is attached to my lunchbox now so that I know I’ll never be without.  Also great when there are surprise office birthdays, because people always remember the cake and always forget the forks.

* SLOW COOKER/INSTANT POT.  I’ve written about all this already in my post on [bachelor bulking]( https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ijjm9h/bachelor_bulking_quit_making_shakes_learn_how_to/), but seriously, get some sort of way to make a lot of food with little effort, put it in the BIG glass container, then transition it to the little glass containers and put that in your lunchbox for the day.

**THINGS TO DO** (workouts before work, full sessions, conditioning sessions, tabata)
* WORKOUT BEFORE WORK.  One of the best things you, as a gainer, can do is to workout BEFORE you get to work.  Why?  Because training makes you hungry, and if you’re struggling to gain, increasing appetite before you get to work is a GOOD thing.  Sure, it also helps make you awake and is good for health and all that, but we’re talking about gaining here.  You can either do a full on lifting workout, a 10-20 minute conditioning workout, OR you could even do a simple short Tabata style workout.

If you’re unfamiliar with what Tabata is: [here]( https://www.t-nation.com/training/tabata-method) is a great article on it by Dan John.  Yeah, it talks about fat loss, but since we’re using it to TRIGGER appetite and THEN eat, it works well for our purposes.  Burpees are a great movement to use this on, as they require no equipment and you can knock it out stupidly quick.  If you have MORE than 4 minutes, look for some Crossfit WODs or just do a simple circuit workout.  You could do something like 5 burpees-10 push ups-20 squats for as many rounds as possible in 10-20 minutes.  Either way, get in the training BEFORE work and then spend the entire time you’re there eating out of that lunch box.  And speaking of eating…

*OFFICE DRONE SNACKS**
These are the foods you should have at your desk, ready to go at a moment’s notice to get your gain on.

* PROTEIN BARS.  I’m a big fan of [Quest](https://www.questnutrition.com/collections/protein-bars), but there are tons of great brands out there.  Costco sells a knock off of Quest that is quite good and cheap, and I buy a lot of those as well.  These are perfect to keep at the desk or in a backpack/pocket for when you need to get on a protein fix.

* NUTS.  I’m not going to link you to nuts: you can figure that out.  But nuts have just TONS of positive qualities associated with them due to their healtful fats, and they are very calorie dense.  Have a jar at your desk.

* DRIED FRUIT.  Raisins, prunes, dates, figs, whatever.  These things don’t spoil and are packed with calories, along with nutrients.  Another fantastic snack.

* NUT BUTTERS.  Peanut butter, almond, cashew, etc.  This, combined with your plastic or bamboo spoon, is absolute money for a quick and easy snack.  I’m actually really into the brand [Nuts N More]( https://nuts-n-more.com/collections/online-store), which is a peanut/almond butter mixed with a protein powder for a slightly better macro breakdown, but as long as you stick with the natural stuff that requires stirring you should be just fine.

* INSTANT OATMEAL.  I like [this brand]( https://www.betteroats.com/), because it coming with it’s own measuring pouch is pretty cool, but again, there are a lot of choices out there.  Instant oatmeal is a real treat on a cold day, and you can use your office microwave or coffee maker to get some hot water to make this quick. 

* POP TARTS.  Man I love pop tarts.  That said, you probably shouldn’t eat them.  …but man I love pop tarts.

Since August 2019, my 5 rep exercises have gone from:

1 set, 5 reps:
Deadlift: 150lbs, 305lbs

Everything else is 5x5:

Squat: 135lbs, 270lbs

Bench press: 95lbs, 165 lbs

Overhead press: 55lbs, 115lbs

Barbell row: 85lbs, 165lbs

Keep in mind these second numbers are just what I’m currently progressing through on PPL (through the Clank app), not like an official max or anything. 

I just don’t know where to go from here. I want to be, you know, jacked, but don’t know if I get there through bulking (I’ve pretty much been on a bulk since I started), or cutting then bulking again. I included pics where I’m flexing but also just passive to show how far my stomach can extend. I’m 180lbs, 5’8”, 18 y/o. From the front, my arms seem kind of lacking but then in other pictures they look okay. Don’t really know where to go to get where I wanna be, through switching programs, cutting or bulking, etc. Been eating 3500 cals almost everyday, definitely getting enough protein.

Also how’s my progress in general? Could it have been better?

Perhaps you guys can help me a little bit of a dilemma I've been having. This indecisiveness has been bugging me for the last couple of months.

&amp;#x200B;

27M, 175 cm, 73-75kg, Natural (for now?)

I've been lifting seriously and consistently for almost 5 years, mainly focused on hypertrophy. In this time I have put on some weight (+10-12kgs) and I am quite content with the results. 

My routine is usually Chest/Back/Legs/Shoulders/Arms , and sometimes I switch to something more similar to PPL. I try to choose weights that allow me to get to 10-12 reps before failure, I might throw in some supersets and dropsets here and there. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've been wanting to take up boxing (or maybe muay thai/mma) and I've been struggling to figure out how to make it fit with my current weightlifting routine without sacrificing too much on that front. 

I understand some sacrifice needs to be done, but I don't even know where to begin, and how to adapt my current weightlifting routine to fit with this new high-intensity gain-killing activity I want to take up. AND how to do it without getting injured !!

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I would be able to maintain my current muscle mass without improvement in size, and make significant improvement in Boxing / MMA. Is this a realistic goal? Or am I being too optimistic?

Waist: ~25 to 28.5""

My wrist and ankle circumference are 6"" and 7.5"" respectively.

#2.1. Training  (part 1 June 2019 - August 2020)

So when I first started working out, I didn't know anything about how to exercise. At the very beginning I couldn't even do a normal push up I was so weak. I didn't even know pull ups were a thing or the fact you had to actually train your back. I didn't start working to get jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. And the only exercises I knew were push ups, sit ups and squats. I didn't have any equipments, neither did I have time or money to go to a gym. I first started with an app called 30 Day Home Workout Challenge or something like that. It had different variations of push ups and sit ups. It took me about 3 months to build up to 10 normal push ups. During this time I was watching a lot of YouTube videos about bodyweight workouts and fitness in general. I didn't have a pull up bar. So I did my pull ups first on a door ledge and then on a collapsible gate with towels wrapped around it otherwise my hands would bleed. The first time I did negative pull ups, after mere 3 reps I had incredible pain in my elbows that lasted almost a whole week. I could neither fully straighten or bend my arms. However I kept going and slowly, very slowly got better until I could do it for some reps without pain.

I had also stopped using that app and was trying things myself. However I didn't know what I was doing. I thought I knew everything from watching YouTube videos but clearly that was not the case. I was following AthleanX and was doing 17 different curl variations with my 25lbs red resistance tube. Most of my exercises were of the same intensity (didn't change the progressions to make it harder) and I always did everything to failure. Was trying out different things like density training, drop set everything, mechanical drop set everything and what not. I was the perfect example of doing fuckaroundities.

Around last year March it slowly occurred to me that I was not moving forward. There was no progress. In fact, I made all the progress in the first 5-6 months and for almost a year I didn't make any progress. Neither strength not physique wise.

I was now following a workout app called Calisthenics. It's not too bad except it used ridiculously high volume and hardly any change in intensity. I was exhausted after each session, but no substantial progress was made... (to be continued)

● Strength level during this period - 10-12 pull ups, 25 push ups, 12 dips (all max)

#2.2. Training (part 2 August 2020 - Now)

I was becoming suspicious of what I was doing and the advice I was getting. During this time (May-June 2020) I read the book Power to the People by Pavel Insulin and it almost completely changed the way I looked at exercising. It was something very new and interesting. I started getting more and more curious about the concept of strength training; started reading more about it on the internet, frequently visiting Powerlifting related forums and getting more knowledge about bodyweight training. Then I got the book ""Science and Practice of Strength Training"" by Vladimir Zatsiorsky and ""Building the Gymnatics Body"" by Christopher Sommer.  And it changed everything. 

I started building and following my own routine and made huge changes to my training (this is around August-September). The major changes was making the rep range 3-5, upping the intensity, taking more rest time, reducing the number of exercises and focusing compound movements while applying the concept of progressive overload. And my strength increased rapidly!

It's important to know that all this while I was training at home at around 3am (then I used to sleep at daytime and stayed up all night). And for equipment I only had a light red resistance band. I used the kitchen counter to do dips and used an old backpack + some bricks for extra weight in pull ups and dips. In June I bought a pair of gymnastics rings which I hung from the gate. And in late October I started going to the park very early morning (5am) worked out there. I also bought a heavy band (50-70lbs) this November.

● Current strength level - max weighted pull ups is approx 25kg (with a brick between my legs), max weighted dip would be around 30kg (I can do about 4-5 reps with the same brick mentioned above). Chest to Wall Handstand Push Up 5 reps (still can't balance a handstand). 3-4 one arm push ups on each arm (clean form). I can hold a straddle front lever for 5-6 seconds but I'm not training Front Lever anymore so that I can fully focus on one arm chin up training. For one arm chin up I can do band assisted (same light band) OAC with 1 finger distance from the ring and where I hold the band. For back lever (supinated) I can hold about 10s of advance tuck open hips, I feel like I'm almost ready for straddle. I'm also training for bent arm planche on Rings where I'm at around 12-15s with advance tuck open hip position. I'm working on my handstand but still can't balance it. I can hold an L Sit on the floor for 20s. Max bodyweight pull is 15-16. I can also do about 5-6 full Dragon Flag however I never trained for it.

#3. Routine

I follow a template, not a fixed routine as exercises keep changing as I move up the progression ladder. It looks somewhat like this -

Day 1. 

A. OAC Progression 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B1. Back Lever 3-4 sets of 3-5/5s-15s superset with 
B2. 10 Reverse Hyperextension (3 min rest)

C1. Weighted pull up 3 sets of 6-8 (2 min rest)
False Grip Hang 3 sets of max hold superset with 
C2. Bicep curls with that ~25kg brick to failure (1m 30s rest)

Day 2. 

A. The hardest pushing exercise that I can do (right now it is RTO Dips with Rings 90° turned out through out the whole movement) 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B. Elevated Dominik Sky style pike push up 4 sets of 5-8 (3 min rest)

C. Bent Arm Planche progression on Rings 3 sets of 10s-20s (2 min rest)

D. Weighted Dip + heavy band 3 sets of 5-8 (2 min rest)

E. Bodyweight Triceps Extension 3 sets of 10-12 (1m 30s rest)

Then repeat day 1...

Along with these I also train handstand for 20-30 min a day and flexibility + mobility for an hour but different time of the day. Everything combined it takes me about 3 hours a day for a full training.

#4. Nutrition

For hypertrophy or weight gain (and loss) diet is one of the most important factors. However I'm helpless in this situation. I can't afford enough food to get big. I eat what is cooked in home. I don't track my macros or calories. I eat rice twice a day (as lunch and dinner) with curries, a glass of milk, I'm not a vegetarian but I rarely eat meat because it's expensive, I also don't eat fish because it tastes very bad, I eat 1 banana before training right after waking up, 2 eggs, loads of potato and for breakfast or snacks in the evening I eat bread with peanut butter. I also drink sattu which contains a good amount of soy protein (about 20g in 100g/2 glass). I have only gained about 10lbs this year which speaks volume about my diet however there is nothing I can do about that.

#6. About me

If you are still reading this (wow lol) and if you are curious about how I got into that low weight in the first place, here's a brief history of me. When I was 9 months old I had a deseas called Steven Johnson's Syndrome (Toxic Epidermal Nacrolysis stage). It's a very rare (like one in a million in US) and severe deseas (Google for more info). I didn't die but I had permanent damage to my eyes. I'm visually impaired, have photophobia/light sensitivity (that's why I used to sleep at daytime) and dry eyes. I was in a blind boys hostel from the age of 6-12 where I didn't eat enough. My weight was very low. I used to poop like once in 2 weeks. Not to mention I incredibly weak I was. My parents got separated when I was like 10 and I stayed with my mom. I started working out not to be jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. 

And I'm totally aware of the fact that my progress is very slow, objectly it's very bad. I'm almost 2 years into it what do I have to show for it, freaking elbow lever? I can't even do a handstand or a muscle up which is nothing short of embarrassment at this point. I want to be very good at what I do, and clearly I'm showing no signs to indicate that. If I keep training hopefully this year will be better and I may have something better to show for next January.

&lt;p&gt;My wrist and ankle circumference are 6&amp;quot; and 7.5&amp;quot; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2.1. Training  (part 1 June 2019 - August 2020)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I first started working out, I didn&amp;#39;t know anything about how to exercise. At the very beginning I couldn&amp;#39;t even do a normal push up I was so weak. I didn&amp;#39;t even know pull ups were a thing or the fact you had to actually train your back. I didn&amp;#39;t start working to get jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. And the only exercises I knew were push ups, sit ups and squats. I didn&amp;#39;t have any equipments, neither did I have time or money to go to a gym. I first started with an app called 30 Day Home Workout Challenge or something like that. It had different variations of push ups and sit ups. It took me about 3 months to build up to 10 normal push ups. During this time I was watching a lot of YouTube videos about bodyweight workouts and fitness in general. I didn&amp;#39;t have a pull up bar. So I did my pull ups first on a door ledge and then on a collapsible gate with towels wrapped around it otherwise my hands would bleed. The first time I did negative pull ups, after mere 3 reps I had incredible pain in my elbows that lasted almost a whole week. I could neither fully straighten or bend my arms. However I kept going and slowly, very slowly got better until I could do it for some reps without pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had also stopped using that app and was trying things myself. However I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was doing. I thought I knew everything from watching YouTube videos but clearly that was not the case. I was following AthleanX and was doing 17 different curl variations with my 25lbs red resistance tube. Most of my exercises were of the same intensity (didn&amp;#39;t change the progressions to make it harder) and I always did everything to failure. Was trying out different things like density training, drop set everything, mechanical drop set everything and what not. I was the perfect example of doing fuckaroundities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around last year March it slowly occurred to me that I was not moving forward. There was no progress. In fact, I made all the progress in the first 5-6 months and for almost a year I didn&amp;#39;t make any progress. Neither strength not physique wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was now following a workout app called Calisthenics. It&amp;#39;s not too bad except it used ridiculously high volume and hardly any change in intensity. I was exhausted after each session, but no substantial progress was made... (to be continued)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;● Strength level during this period - 10-12 pull ups, 25 push ups, 12 dips (all max)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2.2. Training (part 2 August 2020 - Now)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was becoming suspicious of what I was doing and the advice I was getting. During this time (May-June 2020) I read the book Power to the People by Pavel Insulin and it almost completely changed the way I looked at exercising. It was something very new and interesting. I started getting more and more curious about the concept of strength training; started reading more about it on the internet, frequently visiting Powerlifting related forums and getting more knowledge about bodyweight training. Then I got the book &amp;quot;Science and Practice of Strength Training&amp;quot; by Vladimir Zatsiorsky and &amp;quot;Building the Gymnatics Body&amp;quot; by Christopher Sommer.  And it changed everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started building and following my own routine and made huge changes to my training (this is around August-September). The major changes was making the rep range 3-5, upping the intensity, taking more rest time, reducing the number of exercises and focusing compound movements while applying the concept of progressive overload. And my strength increased rapidly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to know that all this while I was training at home at around 3am (then I used to sleep at daytime and stayed up all night). And for equipment I only had a light red resistance band. I used the kitchen counter to do dips and used an old backpack + some bricks for extra weight in pull ups and dips. In June I bought a pair of gymnastics rings which I hung from the gate. And in late October I started going to the park very early morning (5am) worked out there. I also bought a heavy band (50-70lbs) this November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;● Current strength level - max weighted pull ups is approx 25kg (with a brick between my legs), max weighted dip would be around 30kg (I can do about 4-5 reps with the same brick mentioned above). Chest to Wall Handstand Push Up 5 reps (still can&amp;#39;t balance a handstand). 3-4 one arm push ups on each arm (clean form). I can hold a straddle front lever for 5-6 seconds but I&amp;#39;m not training Front Lever anymore so that I can fully focus on one arm chin up training. For one arm chin up I can do band assisted (same light band) OAC with 1 finger distance from the ring and where I hold the band. For back lever (supinated) I can hold about 10s of advance tuck open hips, I feel like I&amp;#39;m almost ready for straddle. I&amp;#39;m also training for bent arm planche on Rings where I&amp;#39;m at around 12-15s with advance tuck open hip position. I&amp;#39;m working on my handstand but still can&amp;#39;t balance it. I can hold an L Sit on the floor for 20s. Max bodyweight pull is 15-16. I can also do about 5-6 full Dragon Flag however I never trained for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. Routine&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow a template, not a fixed routine as exercises keep changing as I move up the progression ladder. It looks somewhat like this -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. OAC Progression 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B1. Back Lever 3-4 sets of 3-5/5s-15s superset with 
B2. 10 Reverse Hyperextension (3 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C1. Weighted pull up 3 sets of 6-8 (2 min rest)
False Grip Hang 3 sets of max hold superset with 
C2. Bicep curls with that ~25kg brick to failure (1m 30s rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. The hardest pushing exercise that I can do (right now it is RTO Dips with Rings 90° turned out through out the whole movement) 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Elevated Dominik Sky style pike push up 4 sets of 5-8 (3 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. Bent Arm Planche progression on Rings 3 sets of 10s-20s (2 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D. Weighted Dip + heavy band 3 sets of 5-8 (2 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E. Bodyweight Triceps Extension 3 sets of 10-12 (1m 30s rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then repeat day 1...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with these I also train handstand for 20-30 min a day and flexibility + mobility for an hour but different time of the day. Everything combined it takes me about 3 hours a day for a full training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. Nutrition&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hypertrophy or weight gain (and loss) diet is one of the most important factors. However I&amp;#39;m helpless in this situation. I can&amp;#39;t afford enough food to get big. I eat what is cooked in home. I don&amp;#39;t track my macros or calories.

,gainit,"Hi all,

So im currently a noob lifter and have been working out on a 4 day split,

- Monday and Thursday
 - flat barbell press 4 x 10
 - deadlifts 5 x 10
 - Overhead press 5 x 10
 - Incline dumbell press 4 x 10
 - dips 4 or 5 x 5 to 10


Tuesday and Friday
 - pull ups or Lat pull down 5 x 10
 - Squats 5 x 10
 - Dumbell seated rows 5 x 10
 - Seated reverse fly 5 x 10
 - Bicep Curl 5 x 10

So this is my 4 day plan... I keep track of my weight and keep them at a range of around 1 maybe 2 from failure. 

The biggest issue I have is that unless i take long breaks by the time I reach the 5th exercise Im pretty rooted and have been finidng that the exercise is super lack luster... 

Last few weeks Ive been cutting the 5th out all together as im pretty flat. 

Im wondering if this is because im new? Starting lifting with my brother (not super structured around 6 months ago) And my body will adjust as I do it more? 

My weekly sets arent crazy high for anything, chest is top with 16 total but that's within the 10 to 20 range i keep hearing.

I posted in thr r/loseit sub and the response i got was to check sleep and diet.

Sleep i aim for 8 hours but get closer to 7. (Rogan and Mathew walker set me on a straight and narrow path on that)

Im currently in a 500 cal deficit, 500 seems to be the amount that most recommend so not sure if this is the problem.",t2_g9fag,False,,0,False,"New lifter...

&lt;li&gt;Overhead press 5 x 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incline dumbell press 4 x 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dips 4 or 5 x 5 to 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday and Friday
 - pull ups or Lat pull down 5 x 10
 - Squats 5 x 10
 - Dumbell seated rows 5 x 10
 - Seated reverse fly 5 x 10
 - Bicep Curl 5 x 10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is my 4 day plan... I keep track of my weight and keep them at a range of around 1 maybe 2 from failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I have is that unless i take long breaks by the time I reach the 5th exercise Im pretty rooted and have been finidng that the exercise is super lack luster... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last few weeks Ive been cutting the 5th out all together as im pretty flat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im wondering if this is because im new? Starting lifting with my brother (not super structured around 6 months ago) And my body will adjust as I do it more? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My weekly sets arent crazy high for anything, chest is top with 16 total but that&amp;#39;s within the 10 to 20 range i keep hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted in thr &lt;a href=""/r/loseit""&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; sub and the response i got was to check sleep and diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep i aim for 8 hours but get closer to 7. (Rogan and Mathew walker set me on a straight and narrow path on that)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im currently in a 500 cal deficit, 500 seems to be the amount that most recommend so not sure if this is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve lurked this subreddit for years and up until about two and a half years ago, I honestly never thought I could bring myself to finally get up to a healthy weight. 

I’m gonna preface this by saying I’ve struggled with body dysmorphia a lot in the past, partly due to my autism and partly due to being called skinny my entire life. HOWEVER, I’ve been relentlessly working on my self-respect and my mental health in general, so it’s leveled out a lot for me.

I should also say, this isn’t a super dramatic transformation and I’m well aware. As I’ll talk about later, I honestly didn’t even set out with gaining weight as a goal until recently, so most of this is just the consequence of living better, not getting fucked up all the time, and eating (a little) better. YMMV. Anyway-

As with so many of you guys, I thought the whole time that it was just my metabolism, and that things would never get better. Well today, I got a memory on my phone of an old shirtless picture. I swear to god y’all my jaw almost hit the floor. I didn’t remember being THAT skinny. So I took another picture of myself today to compare, and that really helped me check my dysmorphia. I have so much trouble actually understanding how I look to other people, but when I saw the pictures back to back it just hit me like a ton of bricks how much healthier I am these days. 

If I’m being real, I didn’t do much to change my weight (at least from a training standpoint). I started doing calisthenics about a year ago and before that I took a job doing electrical work. I’ve also been incredibly lucky to find a partner that loves cooking and eating healthy, and she’s been really helping teach me better habits on that end. After seeing those pictures side by side though, I’ve decided to go all in. I want to feel my best and be as healthy as I possibly can be. 

Anyway, thanks for reading my dumb rant. I love y’all, if you’re a skinny dude like me I’m sure you’ve heard it a million times at this point but you really can gain that weight and be healthy.

In the morning, in addition to your normal breakfast you're going to make a high-calorie protein/mass-gaining shake.  I'd say aim for \~1000 calories in it (this can vary depending on your calorie needs), and use whole foods, i.e don't drink some store-bought massgainer filled with sugar and other crap. I'm not going to dump a recipe in this post because there are plenty of different shakes to be found by searching on this subreddit or elsewhere.  However, I do have my own recipe that's worked very well for me so if people want to know what it is I'd be happy to share in the comments.  

Again, this isn't a replacement for your normal breakfast or another meal.  Instead, you're going to drink this throughout the day, in between meals or during meals, whenever, as long as you get it down.  This is even easier to do now since many people are still working/taking classes from home.  If you are out of the house for a while during the day, get one of those big hydroflask etc. bottles that will keep it from getting gross and drink it throughout the day.  You can drink it in one sitting if you prefer, but I sometimes feel too sick after doing that.  

This was a game-changer for me the first time I was serious about gaining weight in college a few years ago.  It's much easier to consume/digest a shake than adding an extra big plate of chicken/spinach/rice, and you can get even more calories anyway.  If you spread out your consumption throughout the day you barely notice how much extra food you're getting on top of your normal 3-4 meals.  

Some of you new guys may have already started doing this, and if so props to you because you're on the right path.  Also, this is definitely not something you must do.  You don't need any liquid calories to gain, but if you feel like you're already eating as much as you can, then add this to your diet and I guarantee you will see results.

&lt;p&gt;I stopped and took a 3 day break. Now back on day 1, after doing pull ups my elbow is getting really tight, even when doing tricep extensions after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m having trouble describing the feeling. Anyone have any idea on how I could try and troubleshoot this or tips on what this can be described as? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW: I sit on a computer 8+ hrs a day and my wrists/fingers sometime get sore / tight from the fact that my hand and arms are stretched to the keyboard / mouse &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t see doc for a good 2-3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Mythical Strength recently made a post talking about GOMAD and pushed me to make a post sharing my experiences, as I've been doing it since 2018 (with a 10 month break because I stopped training). [Here is his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/kug8ma/the_gallon_of_milk_a_day_gomad_doing_it_right). He specifically stated GOMAD is not sustainable and I'm going to go over why that's wrong. I'll include some tips that winners do as well.

Disclaimer: You don't do this for health reasons, I am in no way advocating you should drink a gallon of milk every day to get more vitamin D. You do it because of the calories, macros, price, and most of all it's so fucking easy. If you can tolerate milk and have trouble gaining weight then I have no sympathy for you. Also I'd like to point out that my opinion doesn't matter, but I'm gonna give it to you anyway.

I'm 6'3, before I started lifting I weighed 165lbs. My peak is 240lbs. I took a long break from lifting and dropped down to 170ish by the time I returned, which was this past August. I am now back to 230 with most of my strength back. I don't know why I feel compelled to say this, but if your activity level goes way down, stop drinking so much milk.

Always whole milk, anything else and you're just pulling your pud. Also, put the empty pints away, drink it straight from the jug or you'll spend all day pouring and doing dishes. 

Much like training, you don't start out pounding a gallon of milk in one sitting. That is one of my goals, but I always chicken out after a half gallon. I started out at 3 gallons a week, and I wasn't even trying to do GOMAD, it was just how much milk I drank. I jumped to 4 very quickly after that and that's when I realized how little effort it took to gain weight versus actually having to chew so much damn food. From there it just felt intuitive and I drank it like water. If you want to reach a gallon a day, progressively overload your milk intake, you will hardly notice it once you have achieved a gallon a day/enlightenment. When you are drinking that much milk, drinking it is refreshing. If I ever get nausea, milk is the first thing I reach for. When I use to go to commercial gyms, I would bring a big ass thermos that held about a quarter gallon of milk with me and drink it between sets.

Maintaining for the long term works great assuming you don't develop some sensitivity towards lactate. Here are three questions people ask me when they find out I drink a lot of milk:

**Won't that make you really fat?**- It can if you don't use your body for anything. 

**Isn't that really unhealthy?**- It's probably not the healthiest thing you could be doing, but it's not as bad as you might think. I've had plenty of checkups with my doctor and blood tests. The only thing that was abnormal in my blood tests is creatinine levels, which are elevated because that's what they do when you exercise. Also, there are people that drink soda everyday and I rarely feel the need to ever drink any because I slam so much milk.

**Doesn't that get crazy expensive?**- No. Think of all of the other things you don't have to buy because so much of your intake is coming from milk, then compare how much that costs to milk. It's pretty damn efficient moneywise. You don't need to buy whey either, protein powder is just derivatives of milk anyway so it's redundant. 

I'm closing, GOMAD isn't a meme. Weighing less than 200lbs as an adult male is, and maxing out your bodyweight squat/deadlift while taking 3 different supplements + mass gainer then complaining about being skinny is. Adding raw weight to your body and lifts isn't.  It is sustainable and will probably make your life easier, as a big chunk of your macros and calories are predetermined.

Two months ago, after losing enough body fat, I started a bulking phase (for the first time in my life). As I read everywhere, I started increasing bit by bit my caloric intake, however I kept losing weight, so I ended up reaching 3000 calorie/day, and now I am finally gaining weight.

However, according to my scale (which, although not very precise, is quite consistent), the rate at which I am gaining seems, at least to me, quite slow.

When I started the bulking, I was around 68kg (~150lb). After two months (the first one I was adjusting the caloric intake, and then Christmas came...), while in an upper/lower workout routine for 4 days a week + some cardio after upper training + 1 specific cardio day, I am at 70kg (~154lb). According to the scale, I gained approximately 1kg of muscle, and 2 points of bf percentage.

My caloric intake atm is approximately 3000 calories, divided in 100 fat / 350 carbs / 180 protein (dancing a bit around those numbers).

I still have a long ways to go, but I’ve enjoyed my time in this sub, thanks for everyone who has helped! I know none of this stuff is revolutionary, and I am not as good of a writer as some poster on here, but this is what I would have told myself 10 weeks ago:

-Don’t go “all in” right away. I think this is a common mistake, I realized I really needed to put on weight, got a little scared, and ended up eating the most food I had had in a single sitting. I felt like crap for the next 2 days. I felt full for these days and in turn, probably ended up eating less.

-I was eating a lot less than I thought I was. Again, I think this is pretty common, I thought I was eating a lot, but when you don’t eat for 6,7,8 hours after breakfast, it’s almost impossible to get in enough calories. 

-I feel so much better, in almost all aspects of life. I no longer feel tired all the time, I’m getting better sleep, and despite it being counterintuitive, I am literally running faster than I ever have in my life. I was hesitant to “bulk” as a distance runner, because a low body weight is so emphasized in the sport. But too little is probably worse than too much, I look forward to running so much more, and have a new love for the sport. 

-I don’t care if I put on a bit of fat. I definitely had some body image issues going on, and thought I wouldn’t like how I looked bigger, it’s the complete opposite. I look more full, and yes I have some fat, but that’s honestly for the better in my case. 

-I’m weak as hell. This is more of a goal looking to the future, as I have made major progress, but still can’t really lift to save my life. I’ve been running Westside for Skinny Bastards, and seriously enjoyed it. 

In the end, I may not have put on as much weight or even as much muscle as I probably could have. I missed meals, messed up workouts and so on.

,gainit,"So I have been doing this routine for about 3 months now. Each day has a compound lift that ends with AMRAP. As a beginner, is it ok to be pushing this absolutely until failure everytime? Even if your form starts to lack? I know the original routine says only as many as you can do with good form, but I've been seeing posts and comments here stating that it doesn't matter.

He is trying to lose weight though, nothing hardcore, but he's trying to atleast NOT gain weight.

I weigh 78kg or 173lbs and am around 16% bodyfat @ 5ft 8/173cm/1.72 m

My nutrition is great and I always hit my macros.


I usually train one body part a day and always push myself very hard. I don't really reserve energy and go to failure in all my working set. 

Monday: Chest
Always start with heavy dumbell press 5 sets of 5 reps, 4 sets of failure for upper and lower chest on incline dumbell press, 5 sets of cable or dumbell flys

Tuesday: Biceps
15 minutes of light weight, trying to activate my bicep and get good mind muscle connection (biceps are terrible)
Usually superset weighted pullups into seated bicep curls and then a burn out with lower weight. I repeat these 3 exercises 4 times with around a minute and a half rest time between

Wednesday: Back
Back really isn't an issue for me as I have decent genetics for it. Seated row machine for 5 sets of failure reps into 4 sets of bent over rows, and then 4 sets of rack pulls to failure

Thursday: Shoulders
Shoulders are similar to my back, where I have decent genetics. I usually start with something like a seated shoulder press doing 10+ reps to failure for 4 sets and then doing the same with rear delt flys. I will then usually do a burnout drop set

Friday: Legs
Begin with heavy squats, 5 sets of 5 into 4 sets of 10+ reps to failure on leg press. 4 sets of machine leg extensions to 10+ reps failure and the same with hamstring curls. Then I finish off with calf raises with weight to failure for 8 or so sets. My calves suck...

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday: Biceps
15 minutes of light weight, trying to activate my bicep and get good mind muscle connection (biceps are terrible)
Usually superset weighted pullups into seated bicep curls and then a burn out with lower weight. I repeat these 3 exercises 4 times with around a minute and a half rest time between&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday: Back
Back really isn&amp;#39;t an issue for me as I have decent genetics for it. Seated row machine for 5 sets of failure reps into 4 sets of bent over rows, and then 4 sets of rack pulls to failure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday: Shoulders
Shoulders are similar to my back, where I have decent genetics. I usually start with something like a seated shoulder press doing 10+ reps to failure for 4 sets and then doing the same with rear delt flys. I will then usually do a burnout drop set&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday: Legs
Begin with heavy squats, 5 sets of 5 into 4 sets of 10+ reps to failure on leg press. 4 sets of machine leg extensions to 10+ reps failure and the same with hamstring curls. Then I finish off with calf raises with weight to failure for 8 or so sets. My calves suck...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday: Light cardio &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday: Rest day&lt;/p&gt;

From June 2018 to January 2021

Disclosure: I had a little weight training experience from college so some of these gains were ""muscle memory-esque"". Really never looked anything close to impressive in college though, and I feel I hit college level after a month or two of lifting again.

There was one cut between these photographs. It was from 213lbs to 187lbs and I would consider it a failure considering how much muscle/strength I lost.

My routine started as a high volume high intensity ""fucking around"" routine where I focused on mind muscle connection and doing what I wanted. Gained some good size doing that, but lost a bunch from my cut.

I eventually decided to start tracking my lifts and following an actual program and have been doing the following routine for about a year and half: https://rippedbody.com/intermediate-bodybuilding-program/

I modify the program to fit my needs in many ways though. It's more of a skeleton. It has been quite successful for me.

I eat a ton of food, usually only focusing on protein goals. I take creatine and sometimes whey protein. Chicken, rice, canned fish, sweets, fruits, milk, nuts, stews, etc. Gaining weight through the 220s was very slow going and tough.

I hope it doesn't need to be said due to my size and conditioning, but I am very much natty.

Starting off, I did the whole eat big to get big thing and ended up getting a bit fat so I decided to do a body recomposition after about 6-7 months. I did a decent amount of research on how to do it, however after the first two months the physique didn't really change. The past 3 months have seen some changes, I've lost around 4kg and my body fat went from approx 22% to around 17-18% (according to the scales) and I've put on some muscle. Essentially, I'm a bit leaner and a little bit bigger then before I start working out. Because of the slow progression, I've been debating undergoing a proper cut, getting lean, before beginning to seriously bulk. Some advice on whether or not do this would be greatly appreciated.

Before I forget, I do track my calories as best I can (eating a slight surplus on the days I workout and a deficit on rest days) as well as tracking my progress in the gym. I did start off quite physically inept having embarrassingly low one rep maxes on the main 3, despite this, they've now risen to mind blowing highs of: 75kg for bench, 90kg for squat and 120 for deadlift. My progression in the gym and lack thereof in the physique is my reason for the post, so some wise words would be awesome.

Thanks very much :)

,gainit,"Just wanted to see if anyone else here is a super hard gainer like me. Getting a bit worried. 

I’m 6’2”, 24 years old healthy male. Been training for 4 years or so.

Last year I gained 12 pounds (168-180) after surgery in a matter of 6 months, while slowly increasing my maintenance calories from 3700 to 4100.

Recently, the weight have stalled around 180 pounds, and I had to increase my intake to 4,200 calories.. looks like the scale hasn’t moved at all for the 5 days. 

The problem is - I don’t live a super active lifestyle. A sedentary office job with gym 3 times a week, but the calories I need to eat are higher than many people on this sub. My TDEE should be way lower than this. 

I track everything diligently using Cronometer, averaging exactly what I plan for the day - 4,200.

Should I just accept my ridiculous metabolism and keep increasing calories until the scale starts to move? At what point should I be seeing a doctor? 

My goal by the end of the year is to be 210lbs, so that’s a little less than 4lb for me to gain in a month. I don’t mind some fat, but I can’t imagine how much I’d need to eat to get there.

,gainit,"Howdy Gainers,

**INTRO**

The infamous ""GOMAD"" approach to gaining weight has been around for about a hundred years now, with pioneers such as Milo Steinborn and Joseph Curtis (JC) Hise leading the charge on it in it's infancy and other great men of strength such as Paul Anderson and Doug Hepburn continuing it's momentum.  It's been written about by authors such as John McCallum and Randall Strossen, and even advocated by more modern types such as Chase Karnes and Matt Reynolds.  HOWEVER, as is often the case with great ideas, the telephone game (I'm dating myself there I'm such: do kids call it the textmessage game now?) has been in effect, and much of the truth behind this method has been lost.  I figure it's worth having a discussion on the subject.


**MY BACKGROUND/EXPERIENCE**

I did the gallon of milk a day approach to gaining back in 2006, while I was in college and on a meal plan, which definitely made things easier.  I paired it with the ""Super Squats"" program, as that is where the idea was heavily emphasized.  You can read about that program [here](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Super+Squats&amp;qid=1610290584&amp;sr=8-1).

In the 6 weeks I drank the gallon of milk a day and ran the program, I also ate a diet that consisted of a LOT of food, and ended up putting on 12lbs in 6 weeks.  I drank 2% milk, as we did not have whole milk in our dinning hall.

Prior to drinking a gallon of milk a day, I had legit not had milk as a beverage since my childhood.   This required a re-acclimation to milk, which I will discuss momentarily.

**WHAT GOMAD IS NOT**

* Healthy.  Understand that from the forefront.  That's not the point of it.  If your goal is maximal health, you should NOT be drinking a gallon of milk a day.  

* Sustainable.  This is a blitz approach, paired with extreme training, to get extreme results.  You won't be doing this for life.  6 weeks was right for me.  Some folks run it for longer. 

* A first resort.  A lot of trainees want to jump onto GOMAD right away, but this is something that's done AFTER you have real nutrition sorted out.  If you're living off weight gain shakes and don't know how to boil water, do NOT do GOMAD.  Learn to cook.

**WHAT GOMAD IS**

* A way to get in an extra 2000+ calories a day with a ton of protein on TOP of a already heavy diet.  The reason milk is advocated is because liquid tends to ""fill in the cracks"" left behind when you have a full stomach.  Basically, you always have room for milk, so while you're mainlining solid calories you can use the milk to get in even MORE restorative calories to recover from VERY intense training.  And that's the thing: don't just drink a gallon of milk a day and run Starting Strength.  You need to be training hard enough that you NEED all those extra calories.

* A last resort.  Maybe not THE last resort, but things should definitely be squared away on the rest of the nutritional front BEFORE you do this.  A gallon of milk a day on top of a terrible diet is going to mean terrible results.

**MISTAKES PEOPLE MAKE**

* If you are like me and NOT a regular milk drinker, do NOT just jump into a gallon of milk a day overnight.  Super Squats and Brawn both talk about how one needs to ease into milk consumption.  I started off by drinking a glass of milk at night before bed for a week.  It was a great way to get in a few extra calories before sleeping, and helped get my gut used to milk while I was too busy being unconscious to feel it's effects.  I then started working a glass of milk into one of my meals of the day on top of the glass before bed.  Eventually all meals had a glass of milk with them, and then I was ready to fully commit to the process.

* On the above, I don't discount that people ARE lactose intolerant, but I also imagine some folks are just not accustomed to drinking milk, and easing into the process will help redevelop that tolerance.  If you ARE lactose intolerant, this is, of course, a terrible idea, and you should not do it.

* Drinking the milk too quickly.  Don't try to get your gallon knocked out so it's ""out of the way"": drink it over the course of the day.  You'll feel much better.

**IF I DID IT AGAIN**

I'd go with something like fairlife or raw milk personally.  As I get older, I'm trying to put better things in my body.  But for a broke college kid, ""free"" milk was awesome.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infamous &amp;quot;GOMAD&amp;quot; approach to gaining weight has been around for about a hundred years now, with pioneers such as Milo Steinborn and Joseph Curtis (JC) Hise leading the charge on it in it&amp;#39;s infancy and other great men of strength such as Paul Anderson and Doug Hepburn continuing it&amp;#39;s momentum.  It&amp;#39;s been written about by authors such as John McCallum and Randall Strossen, and even advocated by more modern types such as Chase Karnes and Matt Reynolds.  HOWEVER, as is often the case with great ideas, the telephone game (I&amp;#39;m dating myself there I&amp;#39;m such: do kids call it the textmessage game now?) has been in effect, and much of the truth behind this method has been lost.  I figure it&amp;#39;s worth having a discussion on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY BACKGROUND/EXPERIENCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the gallon of milk a day approach to gaining back in 2006, while I was in college and on a meal plan, which definitely made things easier.  I paired it with the &amp;quot;Super Squats&amp;quot; program, as that is where the idea was heavily emphasized.  You can read about that program &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Super+Squats&amp;amp;qid=1610290584&amp;amp;sr=8-1""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 6 weeks I drank the gallon of milk a day and ran the program, I also ate a diet that consisted of a LOT of food, and ended up putting on 12lbs in 6 weeks.  I drank 2% milk, as we did not have whole milk in our dinning hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to drinking a gallon of milk a day, I had legit not had milk as a beverage since my childhood.   This required a re-acclimation to milk, which I will discuss momentarily.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey everyone, I wanted to ask you guys what are some realistic strength goals to set for the new year, and what may be good programs or programming ideas to achieve these goals 

Here [https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/workouts/stevedensitystrength.pdf ] is my current program, I’m on week 14 of 16, and I really like it, and I’ve been making good progress (+5 pounds every week on all my barbell lifts) 

I’ve attached my current estimated ORM’s (estimates by symmetric strength, I’ve also included the lifts I imputed to calculate those maxes, or in some cases estimates done by me), it’s important to note before running my current program I did all stupid self programming and really only wanted to gain strength in weights Dio’s and chins ups, so I have terrible strength imbalances. I didn’t even start OHPing until about may of 2020. I was a big idiot. Some imbalances are also because I train from home and have limited equipment so I was not or currently am not able to train certain movements. 

I am 18, 5’10 and weigh 210lbs, I first started working out with basic calisthenics almost 3 years ago, my estimated maxes are 

Bench: 260-270 (225-230X5-6)
OHP 180 (165X3)
Deadlift:315X6-8
Barbell Hack squat (don’t have a squat rack) 315X6-8
Weighted dip +135X8-10 
Weighted chin up: +90X3-5
Cheat row:255X8-9

*if it changes anything, I do my OHP from my bench by putting the pegs at the highest slot, and then turning and facing the wall while seated, but no back support. 

*DIps and chins numbers were from lifts from when I was a little lighter, though I’m fairly certain as I’ve gained weight I’ve kept the same weight added. 



I really look forward to getting stronger, I’d like to build up my bench, OHP, and deadlift a lot, but I also would like to continue in strengthening my Dips and Chins. Should I re run my current program or maybe look into something new? Maybe try something totally different or invest I chains or a sling shot?

,gainit,"https://oatsandwheytoday.blogspot.com/2021/01/feed-conversion-ratio-simple-fact-of.html

What is the FEED CONVERSION RATIO, and does it have any relevance to hard-gainers? Yes, so tuck in for a long read. You need to know that foods you eat are not 100% utilized. You do not digest everything you eat. Some of the calories you eat slip out the other end. **Digestion is never 100% efficient.** How can we know this? Well, pardon the ""yuck""-factor, but if you've ever seen corn or peas in your stool, you know it. If lactose makes you gassy, that attests to this. The very fact that 30% of nuts you eat are eliminated, if not well-chewed, is also proof of this. THIS is why I often say, ""You're not a hard-gainer, you're a hard-digester"". This is often the result of mal-absorption.

**See, it's not how much you can eat, it's how much you can digest.** And some people are just ""not as good"" at digestion. This isn't your ""metabolism"", this is poor food utilization. Additional factors contribute to our ability to process the foods we eat. Food calories can be lost in other ways, to other physiological processes. But we want to maximize the conversion of our calories into weight gain, correct? This is why I wanted to take a moment to have a closer look at this concept of Feed Conversion Ratio. Where does this ratio come from? And does it have any relevance to a hardgainer simply trying to put on good weight?

This Feed Conversion Ratio comes from the livestock industry. These are the folks who fatten up pigs and cattle, to get them to market. These are the people who are highly invested in getting their animals quickly to a certain weight. The animal's gains are literally the farmer's profits. And it would be ideal if each pound of feed produced a pound of meat. But it's nowhere close to this number! The ratio averages 3:1 in the example of a pig. It takes roughly 3 pounds of feed to yield 1 pound of weight. As an example, you might feed 665 pounds of feed to a pig in the weeks it weighs between 40 pounds and 280 pounds. You would calculate the ratio as ""665 pounds of feed divided by 240 pounds of weight gain for a score of 2.77"". You could thus say ""the Feed Conversion Ratio is 2.77:1"" in this instance.

Now, every animal has a different score for feeding efficiency. For beef cattle, FCR calculated on live weight gain of 4.5–7.5 was in the normal range with an FCR above 6 being typical. Some data for sheep illustrate variations in FCR. An FCR (kg feed dry matter intake per kg live mass gain) for lambs is often in the range of about 4 to 5 on high-concentrate rations. As of 2011 in the US, broiler chickens has an FCR of 1.6 based on body weight gain, and mature in 39 days. A lower first number in the ratio is desirable, as less feed is required to yield the same amount of meat.

If it requires 6 pounds of feed to make each pound of beef, versus 3 pounds of feed to produce a pound of pork, versus only 1.6 pounds of feed to grow a pound of chicken, then it's obvious that chicken is more economic in the simple sense that you spend less on animal food to grow the animal for market sale. But even on a species-by-species basis, there is variance within the species breed-by-breed. Sure, the average for a pig is 3:1. But some breeds of pigs might require 3.5 pounds of feed, on average, to gain a pound of weight, while another breed of pig only needs 2.6 pounds of feed to gain that same pound of pork. The latter breed gains weight &amp; muscle with less food.

By this logic, we must extrapolate a conclusion that even among human people, there is not an equal ability to convert food into weight with an identical efficiency. We cannot assume that everyone responds to food (calories) in an identical manner. Is this due to ""metabolism""? Largely, NO. Studies in metabolic wards have confirmed that although some people do have higher basal metabolic rates (resting metabolism), the effect is very slight. It's on the order of about 150-200 calories. Of people with identical height, weight, and body composition, one person might burn 150 more calories in a day. That's really not a lot. So what's going on with hardgainers who swear up &amp; down that they're eating so much more than everyone else? Is this really happening?

First, can we even find a Feed Conversion Ratio for humans? It doubtlessly exists. But that would be beyond the scope of this article. Moreover, it would be highly impractical as well as unethical. For starters, we aren't eating an iso-caloric pelletized food kibble for all of our food intake needs. We also aren't looking at basic-rate growth from infancy-to-adulthood based on per-pound of feed; we're looking in the particular context of weight gain in response to resistance-training hypertrophy. But we don't need to know a rate of efficiency. It's enough to know that the absorption &amp; assimilation of food is variable. And it's affected by other variables, besides enzymatic digestion.

Environment and Temperature can have a big effect on appetite. A pig’s environment can affect its food consumption and conversion. The ambient temperature of the pen must be kept in the thermo-neutral range or it will have a negative influence on a pig’s appetite. Pigs that are cold will eat more feed. Pigs that are hot will eat less. High humidity can also reduce appetite, as can poor ventilation. As a human goes, I can personally attest that I don't want to eat as much when it's too warm, or too stuffy. If ""poor appetite"" is a complaint of yours, this could be one explanation: Your environment is simply too warm for you to get the signal to eat for warmth! A meal should make you warm, due in part to the thermic effect of food. Digesting food requires your body to ramp up, and if you're already warm, hunger may be blunted or muted altogether. And conversely, if it's far too cold, animals will eat more, but also burn more, for heat. Some calories will be lost to heat, when they could have been used for growth.

Are we pigs in a pen being raised for food? Certainly not. But is it unreasonable to assume ambient temperatures play a factor in appetite, as well as metabolism, in the human? Burning body fat for heat is an element of ""calories out"", and it's the largest component of non-exercise energy expenditure. Are you guilty of insisting on wearing a T-shirt in the house during Winter, instead of bundling up a little bit indoors? Not-eating when too warm can impair appetite some of the time, coupled with over-burning when exposed to cooler temperatures and needlessly burning calories for heat another part of the time, can both contribute to impaired weight gain for two different reasons.

Animal Stress also factors into appetite strength. If the density of pigs in the pen is too high, they will experience stress which results in eating less. I'm aware that only so many extrapolations can be made from our pig-farming corollary here, but this also bears legitimacy: People, too, often eat less in times of stress (some are known to eat more, but that's not our demographic). Common stress can play a big role in appetite impairment. So it goes without saying, you might be experiencing stressors in your life, even if unbeknownst to you. Making time to relax before eating a meal might help unlock some of that. A simple 10-minute walk to clear your head and get some fresh air can work wonders in giving your appetite the boost it needs. Mindfulness &amp; meditation may also promote de-stressing.

To shift back to another topic, there is also an effect that results in poor food utilization, which I call the ""Novel Meal Phenomenon"". This is the result of an excessively varied diet, to which the body does not have sufficient time to adapt. This is something you can observe if you've ever had a dog: They acclimatize to their particular brand of dog food and this produces a firm healthy stool. But if you switch food brands suddenly, they'll typically have loose stools for the next couple of days while they adjust to the different macro composition and nutritional profile of the food. This is why it is recommended to mix a little of the new food with the food the dog is already accustomed to, in order to gradually transition the dog to the new food over a couple of weeks, rather than switching all at once. This gives your canine companion some time to re-calibrate its own production of digestive enzymes.

When you are exposed to many of the same foods on a regular basis, your body starts to anticipate them and becomes more efficient at processing them. And although there's still not 100% conversion to usable calories for energy, repair, and growth, more of the total food value is harnessed. If you are often troubled by loose and sloppy bowel movements, it might be due to the novel foods that you've eaten; you've thrown your gut biome a curve-ball. (It's not that those foods are necessarily ""bad"", and had you eaten only those meals, you likewise would have adapted to them over time, by modifying your endogenous enzyme profile). It's a demonstrable fact many people are enzyme-deficient. Some have a poor stomach pH, and will not absorb foods the same way as someone else can. But this is easily remedied. There's a limit to what enzymes you can make, but not to which enzymes you can take.

This is why I'm continually recommending either supplemental digestive enzymes, or enzyme-rich food sources, or both, if you're trying to gain meaningful mass. If you provide digestive support, you will convert more of the foods you eat into mass. If you're hell-bent on running GOMAD (Gallon of Milk a Day), but milk always makes you gassy and crampy, Dairy is probably not a desirable candidate food. (Though if you're determined to attempt it, it would behoove you to either drink only lactose-free milk, or take a lactase-containing digestive supplement alongside it each time. What sense is there throwing a food into the mix, if you're unable to process a component of the food?) Additionally, there is value in probiotics for gut biome support. 

Simply lowering the stomach pH (making it more acidic) can also help. Eating more citrus fruits, berries, and fibrous greens is another tactic to improve digestion. You'll be getting necessary vitamin C, valuable polyphenols and other micro-nutrients, but the biggest value is in digestive support. They also contain fermentable carbs that nourish the gut biome. These are the intestinal bacteria that help digest your other foods. Some of the things you cannot digest, your gut flora will digest for you. Then, you digest the gut flora, and the circle is complete. A thriving gut biome is absolutely necessary not only for raw digestion, but for overall health. At times, I've also kept a bottle of lemon juice in the fridge (not lemonade, but un-sugared, un-watered-down pure lemon juice), of which I drink a Tablespoon-sized shot after a large and bloating meal; it greatly assists in breaking down foods.

Further, this is also why I recommend sticking to 3 or 4 of the same meals which comprise 90% of your bulking diet. Find a handful of meals you don't mind eating all the time. Beef &amp; rice, chicken &amp; pasta, chili &amp; cornbread, beef &amp; bean burritos, tuna sandwiches, whatever your jam is. Rotating through the same small selection of meals will make food prep easier, it will make calorie tracking easier, and it ultimately helps take the guesswork out of what to eat next when it's time to eat again. But equally important, your delicate gut biome will become more adept and adroit and maximizing food absorption. More of the calories you consume will convert into usable energy, primarily in the form of meaningful weight gain. Try thinking of your stomach &amp; intestines as a living creature you have to take care of, like an exotic pet. And when you provide for all the needs of this magical animal, it returns the favor by nourishing and growing YOUR body in return. When it is happy and healthy, it will bestow great gains upon you!

It&amp;#39;s a demonstrable fact many people are enzyme-deficient. Some have a poor stomach pH, and will not absorb foods the same way as someone else can. But this is easily remedied. There&amp;#39;s a limit to what enzymes you can make, but not to which enzymes you can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I&amp;#39;m continually recommending either supplemental digestive enzymes, or enzyme-rich food sources, or both, if you&amp;#39;re trying to gain meaningful mass. If you provide digestive support, you will convert more of the foods you eat into mass. If you&amp;#39;re hell-bent on running GOMAD (Gallon of Milk a Day), but milk always makes you gassy and crampy, Dairy is probably not a desirable candidate food. (Though if you&amp;#39;re determined to attempt it, it would behoove you to either drink only lactose-free milk, or take a lactase-containing digestive supplement alongside it each time. What sense is there throwing a food into the mix, if you&amp;#39;re unable to process a component of the food?) Additionally, there is value in probiotics for gut biome support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply lowering the stomach pH (making it more acidic) can also help. Eating more citrus fruits, berries, and fibrous greens is another tactic to improve digestion. You&amp;#39;ll be getting necessary vitamin C, valuable polyphenols and other micro-nutrients, but the biggest value is in digestive support. They also contain fermentable carbs that nourish the gut biome. These are the intestinal bacteria that help digest your other foods. Some of the things you cannot digest, your gut flora will digest for you. Then, you digest the gut flora, and the circle is complete. A thriving gut biome is absolutely necessary not only for raw digestion, but for overall health. At times, I&amp;#39;ve also kept a bottle of lemon juice in the fridge (not lemonade, but un-sugared, un-watered-down pure lemon juice), of which I drink a Tablespoon-sized shot after a large and bloating meal; it greatly assists in breaking down foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, this is also why I recommend sticking to 3 or 4 of the same meals which comprise 90% of your bulking diet. Find a handful of meals you don&amp;#39;t mind eating all the time. Beef &amp;amp; rice, chicken &amp;amp; pasta, chili &amp;amp; cornbread, beef &amp;amp; bean burritos, tuna sandwiches, whatever your jam is. Rotating through the same small selection of meals will make food prep easier, it will make calorie tracking easier, and it ultimately helps take the guesswork out of what to eat next when it&amp;#39;s time to eat again. But equally important, your delicate gut biome will become more adept and adroit and maximizing food absorption. More of the calories you consume will convert into usable energy, primarily in the form of meaningful weight gain. Try thinking of your stomach &amp;amp; intestines as a living creature you have to take care of, like an exotic pet. And when you provide for all the needs of this magical animal, it returns the favor by nourishing and growing YOUR body in return. When it is happy and healthy, it will bestow great gains upon you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Ability to Digest &amp;amp; Convert Calories into Gains is Intimately Connected to a Thriving Gut Biome!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have been tracking my weight daily for about a month now and it has only gone down about 2 pounds. I don't really know where to add more food to my day, especially the days that I work. I work at a fast-food restaurant (let's just say we are pretty popular here in the Midwest). I work from 5:30am-2pm four days a week. I don't eat breakfast before I leave my house seeing as I leave quite early. I eat my breakfast on my break at 8am and my lunch at 2:30pm when I get home. My schedule and calories is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

**Breakfast: (about 400 cal)**

handful or 2 of cheerios before leaving home, coffee on my drive, packed breakfast of apple, 1/2 pb and j

**Lunch/pre-workout meal: (about 400 cal)**

wrap made of tortilla, meat, mayo and mustard, veggie straws on side and usually a little caffeine boost for pre-workout

**Post-Workout: (150 cal)**

1 scoop ON protein powder with 1 cup of almond milk

**Dinner: (800-1000 cal)**

whatever my mom makes that night. usually consists of meat, potatoes, veggies. varies night to night, but I always eat 2 helpings

**Snack: (300ish cal)**

somedays I eat a bowl of cereal before bed, other nights I make a banana shake that totals about 300 cal. 

**Total each day:** about 2300-2400 cal

&amp;#x200B;

I know this number is below what I should be consuming, but the thing is I don't know where to add more food. I can't eat at work during my shift, so there's a long time period where I go without food. Once I get home I eat a quick supply of carbs and protein then go to the gym. I come home, have my shake, then eat dinner about 20 minutes later. 2 hours after dinner I eat another 300-400 cal snack then go to bed shortly after. I feel full after I eat, so I'm not saving any room or anything. 

I have been lifting on GZCLP for about 4 straight months now, and my gains are leveling off. I know I need to gain weight, but I am having trouble. I track calories religiously, and I read this subreddit till my eyes cross. I am obsessed with lifting, fitness, food, and gaining weight. I feel I may have an ED but I am unsure.

,gainit,"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for all of the useful information over the years as I've lurked. My bulking journey has been good, but we should always strive for better than where we were before, and you all have helped me push towards that ideal of continuous self-improvement.

Throwaway-ish because I don't want any medical information associated with my main account.

Over the past several years, I've been dealing with some odd medical issues that have culminated in a tremendous amount of kidney stone passages, muscle weakness, fatigue, and other negative physiological symptoms.

I'm in my early 20s, the prime time to be putting on some muscle, so this threw a bit of a wrench into my plans.

I'm going to be be on a low-protein (\~.8-1 g/kg) + high alkaline (fruits and veggies) diet, absolutely zero creatine supplementation, and lower-calories overall (no more high-calorie surpluses, so close to  maintenance).

I ask for no sympathy, and am only posting this to remind everyone to keep maximizing your gains while you can - one day you might not have the option!

I know this subreddit usually leans towards *maximizing* gains, but any recommendations on *optimizing*  gains with a restricted diet are greatly appreciated. Of course, I'll talk to my doctor further, but the ""collective wisdom of the crowds"" in a subreddit often offers interesting ideas!

,gainit,"Ive viewed the FAQ regarding shake recipes, but I have a few questions about the logistics.




1. Most recipes include whey/whey isolate. Where do I buy whey like this? Most stores around me only carry ON and other big name brands. Are these fine or is there a better choice?




2. Do you guys drink them slowly or finish them in a quick sitting? I could imagine that I would feel like shit if I downed it instantly, but I also don't want to extend it too far that it breaks into times where I should be eating, but now I feel full.





3. Do you guys generally drink one a day (assuming you dont live off them and eat other meals?)




4. Should I consider adding maltodextrin or dextrose, and if so, where would I even get it?
