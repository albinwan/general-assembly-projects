1,"20 years old and male, started exercising in earnest in January after being skinny my whole life. My situation is that I get 7-9+ hours of sleep every night, but at some pretty fucked hours. I tend to go to sleep pretty late (2-3am, sometimes even later) and wake up around noon (the move to virtual/asynchronous university classes has made it easy to stay on top of work while sleeping in most days, living at home). I've been fairly consistent with eating 3000+ calories everyday for the last few weeks (up from the 2000-2500 average I was hitting in the first few weeks), but I'm wondering if the loss of those morning hours is hindering the benefits I get from my diet and exercise, since I eat my last meal/snack by around 11pm or midnight anyway.

1,"Gotten back into lifting after grabbing some adjustable dumbbells and for the first time, decided to try and do a program. Been trying to use https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/6-day-dumbbell-only-workout this one while swapping out excercises here and there, but, specifically on chest day, I get extremely fatigued after one pressing exercise and it makes it difficult to do another, at least with good form. It doesn't really effect my Pull days, but it does impact my legs only because I half ass train them and often skip a day.

I've always been a heavy-as-you-can type of guy, but with dumbbells it seems volume is the better option. If I start off with flat DBs and hit 3x12 then 2x8 or 10 with the same weight (because I tire out), if i try to do Incline/Decline after it I almost physically can't.

1,"Hey guys, I'm a girl in my 20s. I weigh 130lbs. Im 5'7"". I'm basically skinny fat. My butt is small but round, just not super muscular and firm. Most of my excess fat is localized in my love handles. It's really not a lot and I look skinny in clothes but I just want to be more muscular. I figure body recomp is probably useless for me because it'll take a lot longer for me to gain muscle and lose the fat.

My TDEE is about 2000 calories (I eat a lot and am always hungry so I guess I have a fast metabolism). So I think I should bulk, at about 100 or 150 caloric surplus. My question is, if I successfully gain muscle during this bulk (for about 3 or 4 months) will I lose the stubborn love handle fat naturally, just as a result of having more muscle (since muscle burns more calories at rest??). 

Also, will I gain a lot of fat during a bulk for this period of time? I don't eat processed food, refined sugar, etc.  I strictly eat paleo with the exception of potatoes to control the symptoms of my autoimmune disease. Lots of protein, lots of greens, etc.

Age: 20, Sex: Male, Height: 5'10, Weight: 135-138 lbs, natural

Experience: Started seriously working out since September 2020, stopped between November till end of Jan due to personal issues. Restarted in Feb in a proper gym and have good form in main lifts such as Bench, OHP, Squart, and DL. In my 3 months or so of serious training I have gained significant progress and people have noted my size difference.

Main goals: Increase size and strength. Mix of hypertrophy and strength. But mostly appreciate aesthetics.

Current Maxes:

Bench: 125 lbs for 3 reps ( can be done for about 3 sets given 2 warmup sets and 2 sets of 115 lbs)

Deadlift: 145 lbs. Can continue to increase, not sure where my limit is but slowly increasing to avoid injury

Squat: 135 lbs. Slowly increasing, can do 3 set of 7 reps given warmup sets and others

Overhead Press: 75 lbs, slowly increasing. Can do 4 sets of 5 with prior warmup

Question regarding LM Bulking Routine:

1. I understand the exercises that are on the program, but I was wondering whether I can modify it to fit my 6 days a week workout schedule. I am also unsure about what weight to use for the workout and how to increase. For example, what should I start with now and how much should I increase per week?
2. I noticed there aren't any ab exercises in this program. I therefore assigned Wednesday's rest day as the designated abs day
3. Stiffleg deadlifts vs regular deadlifts?
4. Any app recommendations to store this program on? I am currently using the Gymshark app. But would appreciate maybe an app that contains a ""weeks"" function and another function that alters your set weights based on new max PRs.

1,"From August 2019-September 2020 I did little to no consistent training. I went from 230ish to 170 at my lowest. Coming back to training was really hard, and I sympathize with you if you are restarting after losing everything. I want you to know that although you may  THINK have lost all of your muscle and strength gains, they are still there just laying dormant. Years of training results in additional satellite cells being created and etched into your muscles that stick around for *decades*. 

I was 175 when I started back up. The first time I came back to the gym, I was warming up to squat and [fell backwards on my ass almost every set.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEIRK8uA7i-/?igshid=13gd8vqnv96wb) I was so mad at myself and my body. I knew how to squat in my mind, but my body just didn't have the skill anymore, it had to be redeveloped. I wasn't even as close to upset at how little weight I could move compared to actually not being able to squat. Be nice to yourself when you come back, you know how to do it, but you need to be patient with your body as it relearns. 

It has been 6ish months since I have returned to lifting and I have already set lifetime PRs and gained all of the weight I lost back. In fact, I am 245 now and that is also a lifetime PR. Here is what I did the first 2 and half months and my advice for returning to the gym:

**DO NOT test your maxes**

After I realized my body lost a ton of motor patterns, I was so upset, it is such a bad feeling. On top of that, I knew I was weak. To help protect my ego, I refused to learn my maxes on lifts, it would only cause more harm to me mentally. Ignorance is definitely bliss when you're starting again from scratch, and you have no business pushing yourself to the max at this point. You will thank yourself for choosing to ignore the truth at this time later down the road, I promise.

**Accumulate work capacity**

This should be your number one priority. Your tolerance for work capacity has dropped so far down and you need to ease back into it. Go very slow! Do not jump in the deep end right away, you have no business running a 6 day routine with 5-7 exercises a day, 2 exercises a day and some light conditioning will take you far at this stage. 

**Focus on practicing**

Those motor patterns that are 'gone' are still there, just dormant. You cannot force or rush this phase, it is a process. Focus each training session around a compound movement and do not go anywhere close to failure. You should barely be straining at first, your muscles need to relearn the movement and you need to focus on coordination. Trying to build muscle at this point is asinine and not what we are after. Your body is terribly inefficient at moving weight again but will regrow exponentially faster than the first time if you do it the right way. Keeping it light without a ton of volume is perfect, that way you get more practice than muscle damage. 

**High frequency, low intensity low volume per session**

I originally said low volume, but that's really not true on a weekly basis. I lifted everyday, but only did 2 exercises of 4-6 sets of 6-10 reps. This is all you need at first and I promise it will set you up for success. You will not be stuck training like this for long.

**How to pick weights** 

I recommend you read easy strength by dan john, as this had a lot of influence on my returning to training.

This was very simple for me, just pick a weight that used to be your first or second warmup set. It should be extremely light, like lighter than you are probably thinking right now. You can do more with light weight, you can put more force into the bar than required or change the tempo to make it more difficult. F=ma, there I just proved it scientifically. If you choose a weight that's too heavy, not only can you not do these things, but you also don't have room to progress and you might end up missing. 

**How to progress**

The first month I used a very simple double progression model, which is to say you don't increase load until 2 variables are achieved. For example, say my deadlift day starts at 3x6 (which it did). The next session I'd do 4x6. The session after that I'd do 4x8, then 5x8, followed by 5x10. Only after I reached 5x10 on an exercise would I add weight and reset to 3x6. And I usually only added 10lbs each time I reset back to 3x6. The second month, start adding in hard conditioning, hill sprints and 60/120s are my go to and will always be a staple for me. I recommend you go easy on conditioning at first though.

**When to stop and move on**

You'll know you're ready when you are confident enough to test your maxes. 2.5 months back for me was enough. I tested my maxes and about 85% of my strength was back. 

Returning after a layoff can feel daunting and is a dreadful experience, but you will pick up where you left off in a very fast time frame. You'll get those gains back so fast that you'll feel like you're on steroids. [This](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFA6RWOgKqC/?igshid=pbpl1bae3ogd) is only a few months away from [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLzvb0sAz87/?igshid=1lsfrtu2ciw55).

1,"Happy weekend y'all!


I've been putting off lifting for a long time and my apartment gym just recently opened up again. I'd liked to start a beginner lifting program with what is available to me at the gym and what I have at home.


At the gym:
 
Dumbbells ranging from 5 to 100 lbs (i think)
Lat pull down machine
Bench machine
Tricep pull down machine (or whatever it's called)
Cycle equipment


Home

Pull up bar (thought it fits my door frame terribly)
Resistance bands (up to 25 lbs)


I think the biggest issue will obviously be getting s good leg work out in, but there must be something I can sub in that will work for a few months.

Any suggestions?",Help me design a beginner program with the equipment I have available to me,"Help me design a beginner program with the equipment I have available to me Happy weekend y'all!

1,"I'm nearing my weight goal by being only 4kg away. My body, over a year and a half since starting training, has seen an amazing change. I couldn't be more happier. Not quite the goal body I'm aiming to but it's the next best thing. The thing is, meanwhile, I have put on a lot of size. It was hard and painful work. And I'm loving the look of it. 

However, it wasn't all muscle. Naturally, gaining so much weight I gained a fair bit of fat too. It's really not that much. I kept definition everywhere except in my abdomen area. If I flex really hard the abs will show, but yeah I did grow a bit of gut. Anywhere else is pitch perfect. Defiinition on my chest, traps, shoulders and arms. Now I'm contemplating cutting but like an extremely low deficit. I'm talking near maintenance levels of deficit. The reasons are twfold: I'm afraid to look scrawny again and lose a lot of my muscle. Secondly, my legs, however, did not see the development I hoped I'd get. I'm afraid if I cut they'd just get even thinner then they are right now. 

PS: I'm also afraid of losing the strength I gained, which is pretty cool for my size.

1,"BACKGROUND &amp; GOALS: I am a classic case of skinny-fat (very little muscle due to previous irresponsible crash dieting with very little weight training experience in the past, 16% body fat, look terrible with fat concentrated on my belly). 

My strategy to fix my physique has been to gain muscle at a slow rate, even if I gain a little bit of fat along the way (with the thinking that if I gain more muscle than fat as I go, my bf% will go down through the process). 

DIET: I am eating 1g of protein per lb of body weight per day and am only eating a 100-200 calorie surplus each day. Fats: 20-30% (was higher, but have brought this down), carbs: 30-40%, protein: 30-40%. I'm really trying my damndest to be exact with my tracking. Eating almost exclusive homemade, quality food.

TRAINING: I am in my second week of PHUL. Really liking the program. Am focusing on the proper rep-ranges with progressive overload being my focus. I am getting stronger.

SLEEP: at least 8-9 hours

My electronic scale is telling me that my bf% is going UP and that my skeletal muscle is going DOWN which is the exact opposite of what I am after.

My body simply rejected food for nearly two weeks and my gains have worn off me. I haven't stepped foot inside the gym for nearly 4 weeks however part of that is because I moved cities and the city I moved to went straight into lockdown when I got there.

1,"Hey r/gaintit,

I've been following this subreddit since November and in January, I finally started to do something about my lack of gains. January 1st, I was 150 lbs, and I'm 6'3. I take in roughly 2800-3000 calories a day. I do push/pull/legs twice a week and Sunday is rest day. I now weight 165 lbs and have been seeing some solid gains.

Since starting, I've been able to see results everywhere EXCEPT my chest. My chest feels stronger if I press it but in terms of mass size, it doesn't look any different. I currently do - dumbbell bench press, dumbbell incline bench press, inclined chest flyes and push ups (regular and wide). Push ups seem to be the only exercise where I feel my chest after the work outs, the rest feel like it works my traps more than anything.

Wanted to ask - is this normal? Is chest harder to see gains than other muscle groups? Should I try other exercises or could something be off with my form?

General info - I do not have access to a gym and probably won't for a few more months. No dip station and can't make a home one either with the stool chairs I have in my apartment. Have access to a workout bench, pull up bar, two dumbbells that go up to 40 lbs each (which I can bench press for 3x12, albeit I'm winded after) and tensions bands.

I’ve been on a gradual weight loss for several years having started out weighing 97.5kg and have gradually worked it down to now floating around 70kg - obviously I’m happy with this and I’m somewhere between skinny fat and ‘toned’.

My goals never to be ‘huge’ but I do want to get some more size to my arms and fill my shirt out, I can’t lift that heavy but I do want to start taking increasing strength more seriously when the gyms reopen (UK lockdown atm) and I know feasibly to do this I’ll need to increase my calories.

**Background:** I’ve always been small. 5’9 &amp; 140lbs. I boxed for 4 years but didn’t weight train, I decided to start lifting weights after I got diagnosed with a detached retina. 

It was a lot to learn, and I started off barely benching the bar. Even though it was embarrassing to be at the gym, I still went. 

I bulked to 160lbs during my first year, and continued cutting/bulking cycles. (This is very ineffective, and looking at my physique today, I realize that.) 

In 2019, I got deployed and dropped to my lowest weight ever at 138lbs when it was all said and done. Upon returning home I immediately got back in the gym, and muscle memory hit me like a train. Within a month I was back to 160lbs &amp; I’m currently fluctuating between 175-180lbs

MUSCLE MEMORY IS A DRUG! (I wasn’t even necessarily bulking when I came home, I was eating out constantly and just enjoying myself, but my training was very serious.) 

Overall Transformation (More at the bottom.) : [Imgur link ](https://imgur.com/gallery/5lBqwbA)

 
**Stats:** 5'9"", Male, SW 140LB, CW 180LB

**Lift Progress:** I’m aware I’m not very strong, my numbers should be higher for someone who’s trained for 4 years. But I like to focus on bodybuilding vs powerlifting. There is no shame in that! I stopped worrying about numbers a couple years ago, and I am much happier now that I don’t have that weight on my shoulders. 

**Bench:** 65LB &gt; 245LB (no lie, I barely could do the bar. My first max was legitimately 65lbs) 

**Squat:** 95LB &gt; 315LB

**Deadlift:** 135LB &gt; 375LB

**OHP:** 45LB &gt; 135LB (Most impressive in my opinion, OHP utilizes much more than just shoulder strength! Good technique can get you stronk) 

**Diet:** I tracked calories using the infamous MyFitnessPal app. I started at 2700 cals, &amp; slowly transitioned into 3200 cals. Eating this many calories has always been difficult for me, I thought I was a “hardgainer” but then I realized I was using that as an excuse as to why I’m not hitting my goals. My most successful way of thinking was forcing myself to eat 1000 cals in the morning, &amp; 800 for lunch. Dinner was easy to get calories in, because I could consume 500 cals before the gym, and whatever remained I could fit in after the gym. 

IF YOU’RE BULKING: Breakfast is a HUGE indicator on how your day will go. If you can wake up 30 mins earlier than normal, you’ll have more time to cook quality food and put a dent into the days calories. My favorite breakfast was always: 6 scrambled eggs, 2 Kodiak Pancakes, a bowl of strawberries, &amp; 2 packets of oatmeal. 

Lunch: Usually 8-12oz of chicken breast and 1 cup of rice. With a side of steamed broccoli (thank you instant pot) 

Dinner (Pre Gym): 1 pack of ramen (the sodium gives you joocy pumps.) And a banana (cus helth.) 

Post Gym: 2 scoops of protein shake (50g of protein.)

Dinner (Post Gym): Pasta noodles &amp; ground beef or steak. (Depends what I have time to cook) 

**If I didn’t hit my required calories, I would make my homemade mass gainer shake. 

MY MASS GAINER RECIPE:
-2 scoops of protein
-1 cup oats
-1 spoon of Peanut Butter 
-1/2 banana (eat the other half, it’s just a yummy snack) 
This amounted to approximately 700-800 cals, depending on your protein. 


**Routine:**

I’ve pretty much followed PPL for my whole lifting career. I tried nSuns for a bit, but I didn’t like doing 8sets of power lifts. I was more focused on doing bodybuilding movements. I’ve never done anything out of the ordinary with my training, it’s always been pretty basic and just use what I had at my gym.  


PUSH DAY: 
5x5 Bench Press (FLAT) 

4x12 Bench Press (INCLINE) 

4x15 Pec Deck (Fly’s)

4x10 Chest Press

4x10 Lying Dumbbell Skullcrushers (I noticed I get more activation out of my triceps by using dumbbells versus a EZ bar or barbell.)

4x12 Rope Push Down

4x10 Reverse Pull Down (Use a bar for these and grip the bar underhand, this is my favorite triceps exercise. I’ve never felt activation quite like this.)


PULL DAY
5x5 Deadlifts 

4x10 Barbell Row

3x10 Good Morning (usually after the 3rd set my lower back is like “nah fam” so I rarely went over 3 sets) 

4x10 Lat Pulldown 

4x10 Cable Row 

4x12 Bicep Curls

4x7 Hammer Curls (HEAVY)

4x10 Incline Dumbbell Curls 

4x21 21’s (great to finish off with.)

4x10 Rear Delt Fly


LEG DAY (.. and shoulders)
5x5 Barbell Squat

4x8 Front Squat 

4x10 Leg Press

4x15 Leg Extension (go light, work the eccentric motion. Try to take pressure off your knees, this exercise is notorious for wrecking knees.)

4x12 Hamstring Curl (go light, focus on the SQUEEZE, if you do these right you may have Charlie horses that night in bed. ) 🥴

5x5 Overhead Press 

4x15 Side Lateral Raise 

4x15 Front Raise (Dumbbell) 


***TIPS***

Buying a crock pot / instant pot is a game changer. I could throw a roast or even a steak in the crock pot, let it cook on low while I slept. And when I woke up, I had a fresh meal ready to go! 

DON’T WEIGH YOURSELF EVERYDAY (this can be counterproductive when you get tunnel vision on a number. I weigh myself on Mondays / Thursdays.. And always weigh yourself at the same time everyday. First thing in the morning is best, before you eat.) 

Getting in calories immediately after the gym is an easy way to hit your calorie numbers. Your body is taxed and can absorb more food right after (jk Idk if that’s even true but that’s what I tell myself🤔) nah but for real, it’s always easier for me to get in calories right after the gym, so I usually double scoop a protein shake. 

Creatine is your friend, take creatine. No you don’t have to hand in your natty card, and it won’t cause you to behave any differently. But it does retain water and help you become more “full looking” 

GET BLOODWORK DONE! Usually bloodwork is only recommended if your cycling steroids, but you NEED TO KNOW if your body is producing enough Test, and if certain supplements are needed for your diet!!

**Background:** I’ve always been small. 5’9 &amp; 140lbs. I boxed for 4 years but didn’t weight train, I decided to start lifting weights after I got diagnosed with a detached retina. 

It was a lot to learn, and I started off barely benching the bar. Even though it was embarrassing to be at the gym, I still went. 

I bulked to 160lbs during my first year, and continued cutting/bulking cycles. (This is very ineffective, and looking at my physique today, I realize that.) 

In 2019, I got deployed and dropped to my lowest weight ever at 138lbs when it was all said and done. Upon returning home I immediately got back in the gym, and muscle memory hit me like a train. Within a month I was back to 160lbs &amp; I’m currently fluctuating between 175-180lbs

MUSCLE MEMORY IS A DRUG! (I wasn’t even necessarily bulking when I came home, I was eating out constantly and just enjoying myself, but my training was very serious.) 

Overall Transformation (More at the bottom.) : [Imgur link ](https://imgur.com/gallery/5lBqwbA)

 
**Stats:** 5'9"", Male, SW 140LB, CW 180LB

**Lift Progress:** I’m aware I’m not very strong, my numbers should be higher for someone who’s trained for 4 years. But I like to focus on bodybuilding vs powerlifting. There is no shame in that! I stopped worrying about numbers a couple years ago, and I am much happier now that I don’t have that weight on my shoulders. 

**Bench:** 65LB &gt; 245LB (no lie, I barely could do the bar. My first max was legitimately 65lbs) 

**Squat:** 95LB &gt; 315LB

**Deadlift:** 135LB &gt; 375LB

**OHP:** 45LB &gt; 135LB (Most impressive in my opinion, OHP utilizes much more than just shoulder strength! Good technique can get you stronk) 

**Diet:** I tracked calories using the infamous MyFitnessPal app. I started at 2700 cals, &amp; slowly transitioned into 3200 cals. Eating this many calories has always been difficult for me, I thought I was a “hardgainer” but then I realized I was using that as an excuse as to why I’m not hitting my goals. My most successful way of thinking was forcing myself to eat 1000 cals in the morning, &amp; 800 for lunch. Dinner was easy to get calories in, because I could consume 500 cals before the gym, and whatever remained I could fit in after the gym. 

IF YOU’RE BULKING: Breakfast is a HUGE indicator on how your day will go. If you can wake up 30 mins earlier than normal, you’ll have more time to cook quality food and put a dent into the days calories. My favorite breakfast was always: 6 scrambled eggs, 2 Kodiak Pancakes, a bowl of strawberries, &amp; 2 packets of oatmeal. 

Lunch: Usually 8-12oz of chicken breast and 1 cup of rice. With a side of steamed broccoli (thank you instant pot) 

Dinner (Pre Gym): 1 pack of ramen (the sodium gives you joocy pumps.) And a banana (cus helth.) 

Post Gym: 2 scoops of protein shake (50g of protein.)

Dinner (Post Gym): Pasta noodles &amp; ground beef or steak. (Depends what I have time to cook) 

**If I didn’t hit my required calories, I would make my homemade mass gainer shake. 

MY MASS GAINER RECIPE:
-2 scoops of protein
-1 cup oats
-1 spoon of Peanut Butter 
-1/2 banana (eat the other half, it’s just a yummy snack) 
This amounted to approximately 700-800 cals, depending on your protein. 


**Routine:**

I’ve pretty much followed PPL for my whole lifting career. I tried nSuns for a bit, but I didn’t like doing 8sets of power lifts. I was more focused on doing bodybuilding movements. I’ve never done anything out of the ordinary with my training, it’s always been pretty basic and just use what I had at my gym.  


PUSH DAY: 
5x5 Bench Press (FLAT) 

4x12 Bench Press (INCLINE) 

4x15 Pec Deck (Fly’s)

4x10 Chest Press

4x10 Lying Dumbbell Skullcrushers (I noticed I get more activation out of my triceps by using dumbbells versus a EZ bar or barbell.)

4x12 Rope Push Down

4x10 Reverse Pull Down (Use a bar for these and grip the bar underhand, this is my favorite triceps exercise. I’ve never felt activation quite like this.)


PULL DAY
5x5 Deadlifts 

4x10 Barbell Row

3x10 Good Morning (usually after the 3rd set my lower back is like “nah fam” so I rarely went over 3 sets) 

4x10 Lat Pulldown 

4x10 Cable Row 

4x12 Bicep Curls

4x7 Hammer Curls (HEAVY)

4x10 Incline Dumbbell Curls 

4x21 21’s (great to finish off with.)

4x10 Rear Delt Fly


LEG DAY (.. and shoulders)
5x5 Barbell Squat

4x8 Front Squat 

4x10 Leg Press

4x15 Leg Extension (go light, work the eccentric motion. Try to take pressure off your knees, this exercise is notorious for wrecking knees.)

4x12 Hamstring Curl (go light, focus on the SQUEEZE, if you do these right you may have Charlie horses that night in bed. ) 🥴

5x5 Overhead Press 

4x15 Side Lateral Raise 

4x15 Front Raise (Dumbbell) 


***TIPS***

Buying a crock pot / instant pot is a game changer. I could throw a roast or even a steak in the crock pot, let it cook on low while I slept. And when I woke up, I had a fresh meal ready to go! 

DON’T WEIGH YOURSELF EVERYDAY (this can be counterproductive when you get tunnel vision on a number. I weigh myself on Mondays / Thursdays.. And always weigh yourself at the same time everyday. First thing in the morning is best, before you eat.) 

Getting in calories immediately after the gym is an easy way to hit your calorie numbers. Your body is taxed and can absorb more food right after (jk Idk if that’s even true but that’s what I tell myself🤔) nah but for real, it’s always easier for me to get in calories right after the gym, so I usually double scoop a protein shake. 

Creatine is your friend, take creatine. No you don’t have to hand in your natty card, and it won’t cause you to behave any differently. But it does retain water and help you become more “full looking” 

GET BLOODWORK DONE! Usually bloodwork is only recommended if your cycling steroids, but you NEED TO KNOW if your body is producing enough Test, and if certain supplements are needed for your diet!!

1,"Recently my knees have been getting painfully sore during lifts. Its not sharp knee pain, but the area around my knee feels like its swelling/sore. I started noticing it on my squat days, and now I'm also noticing it on deadlift days. I feel fine on days I don't lift legs, and my legs feel fine until I get to my 3rd sets (I'm doing 5/3/1). The last time I had knee issues was from bad form when I first got into lifting like 7 or 8 years ago, that was quickly fixed and I've been fine since.

I've been icing my knees, but I'm wondering if the lack of cardio in my workouts may be contributing to my knees possibly getting weaker? (if that's even a thing) I'm currently squatting and deadlifting more than I ever have in my life, so my knees are probably not used to this. 

Anyone have a good workout to build strength in the knee area for heavier lifting, or advice? Is this just a ""ice them and rest them"" kind of situation or should I be doing stuff to support my knees? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also: I currently don't wear knee sleeves (but have been thinking of buying some), or any other physical gear for squats. Just flat converse shoes - and a belt when I deadlift.

Edit: thank you everyone for the solid advice! It seems pretty obvious I need to learn to squat with a knee sleeve and possibly look into a supplement for the pain/swelling (whatever it is). Thank you all again!

1,"M / 28yrs / 168lbs. / 5' 10"" / 19% bf

Background: About two years ago, I was a very pudgy, unathletic 185lbs. when I decided to start making an effort to better my health. I learned about CICO, began tracking my calories and making sure I wasn't eating more than 1500 calories/day, as well as started training for half-marathons. This became a pretty on-and-off routine for me during the past two years. Eventually, I was able to get down to 158lbs, and felt pretty great, but I was still physically weak, with not much muscle on me whatsoever.

Five weeks ago, I decided to join a gym and shift my focus towards weight lifting and bulking for the first time in my life. My issue is, I feel like I'm gaining too much fat too quickly, and I honestly feel like shit.

When I started my bulk, I began by eating 3,000 kcal/day, which was a 500 kcal surplus from my TDEE, and I made sure I was getting 160g protein/day. As I started to notice I was putting on more than 1 lb./week,  I started reducing my daily calorie intake, and right now I'm consuming 2,500 kcal/day. But, over the past five weeks I have gained 10 lbs, and my belly is getting noticeably larger at a much faster rate than my muscles. Right now, I feel fat, constantly bloated from forcing myself to eat enough food, and because I'm always bloated I consistently feel lethargic and very low energy. I honestly felt physically better when I only ran and focused on eating fewer calories, which I know is counterintuitive. But, I want to get bigger, stronger, and start putting on muscles, and I know I can only do that by eating more calories.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently doing nSuns 4days/week, as well as running \~15 miles/week.

My typical diet right now is 340g cottage cheese + 1 scoop protein powder for breakfast / chicken breast + leftover veggies + cup of rice for lunch / dinner is usually pretty variable, but I try to keep it within my calorie and protein goals for the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm really just looking for reassurance on whether this is a normal experience, and if I need to suck it up and start raising my daily caloric intake and just accept that fat comes with muscle. I know that five weeks is not a very long time at all to start seeing any progress whatsoever, but if I'm making mistakes, I'd like to start course-correcting as soon as possible.

Not being able to get enough food down is an actual problem that a lot of powerlifters and bodybuilders often face when they’re trying to push the number on the scale. Force feeding is hard work, and can make for being extremely uncomfortable when you have to eat beyond the point of satiation. I’ve been there. The scale stops moving, calories are already extremely high, and you’re really full after every meal and even before your next meal. It can be really frustrating feeling bloated. After all, they say your gut is like a second brain. So if digestion isn’t on point, it’s not unheard of to be unhappy because of it.

I do not have a problem with appetite anymore. There is a number of strategies I have implemented to help getting the food down. I hope the tips that I have accrued throughout this offseason help you out and allow you to get more food down the hatch.

1. PROTEIN IS VERY SATIATING. I started my last prep at 280g of protein per day. That’s a lot of protein for an 82kg person. No wonder I was struggling to finish my meals (I always did though. Despite having to force it down.) The protein was too excessive for my bodyweight. However, I didn’t get my protein that high on purpose. It happened by default when I was upping my carbs. The small amounts of protein you get from carbs such as rice, potatoes and pastas all add up. When I was increasing the calories, I mistakenly kept my serving size of meat for each meal the same. This ended up me continually adding protein to my diet beyond the point of it being excessive. Even a lot of fat sources contain quite a high amount of protein. Fats like nuts and cheese add protein as well. So the approach I took this year was this. Keep protein at 1g/2.5-3x BW in kg. When upping carbs, drop volume of meat per meal to suit with the added protein I’m getting from that meals carb source. Keep in mind, carbohydrates are protein sparring, so especially in a calorie abundant environment, having a little less protein from animal sources won’t be detrimental to progress. It will be helpful, because you’ll be able to get more carbs down. Unlike protein, carbohydrates are appetite stimulating. Leaving you hungrier and ready for your next meal. Every 60 days, I readjust my Fat and Protein numbers to suit my new bodyweight. This usually only makes for a small increase of 5-8g for each. Like I mentioned in a previous blog, my fats stay right around 1g/1kg BW. So keeping fats low and protein moderate, allows me to eat the least satiating macro more, allowing for continuous calorie progression, and no feeling of bloat or distension.
2. 10 MINUTE WALKS. A common problem that people struggling to consume enough calories due to being too full is not efficiently digesting what they’re eating. The first step is to eat foods that you can digest easily. And then consider going for a brisk 10 minute walk following that meal. Improve digestion, improve appetite, also, improve metabolism.
3. Stan Efferding’s patent pending MONSTER MASH. A way I have found making very large meals less intimidating is by making it into a mash by adding roughly 30 mL of chicken broth to it. It makes the large meal SO much easier to eat. It’s almost like the meal is already chewed up for you, you just need to send it down the hatch. Chicken broth has a lot of health and immunity benefits, but it also makes for meals that sit real easy in the stomach, and somehow, probably magic, don’t fill you up. This make consuming 1,000 calories in a sitting feel like Childs play.
4. IF YOU CANT EAT ALL YOUR CARBS, THEN DRINK ‘EM! I use orange juice. 3 times a day, 500mL each. 50g of carbs, 215 calories, fucking delicious. This makes for 150g of carbs, 645 kcal a day just from liquid. It is as satiating as 500 mL of water. Go figure. Plus, loaded with micronutrients.
5. SMALLER, MORE FREQUENT MEALS. No science or research papers to back this one up. The way I see it is simple. I want to look like a bodybuilder, so, i’ll eat like one. Provide the body with a message, hopefully the body gets the message. Give the body enough cellular signalling to achieve the goals that you are intentionally providing it. If you want to fast all day and look like your hobbies include yoga and Prius conferences, then go for it. I find it difficult getting 5,000 calories in, in a 4 hour window. So my solution is simple. Do it the way the bodybuilders have done it from the start. Eat from the moment I get up, to before I go to bed.

This list is simple. Really simple. But it’s these little details that often get overlooked when assessing ones diet. Constant overfeeding, in my opinion, leads to blown-out midsections and enlarged waists. I feel like I fell prey to this after only a year of force feeding. I started the mass phase very lean, got to power-shovelling the food, ate beyond satiation, dieted back down, and my waist was noticeably larger then before. If you’re digesting your food properly, hunger levels follow as a result. If you’re NOT hungry for your next meal, instead of forcing the next one day, firstly, address why it is that you’re not hungry. If you were breaking down food efficiently, you’d be ready to eat every single time that next meal was knocking on your bodybuilding goals door. 

As a side note, Pro Tan emphasises that SHIT out of stretch marks. Blow out your waist? Better get comfortable with the stretch marks on the glutes, hips, lower back and lower abs to stick out like dogs balls.

There’s no such thing as a hard gainer. Every single person that i’ve conversed with who self-diagnosis’ themselves as struggling to put on weight, is simply put, not even close to trying hard enough. Force feeding is really uncomfortable, but it’s not the only means of getting those needed calories down. Learn to choose foods that you can eat in large quantities, pick foods that are extremely dense in calories, and address digestion issues. If the scale isn’t moving upwards, it’s not because you’re a hard gainer, it’s because it doesn’t mean enough to you. To actually illicit some change in bodyweight, you may have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It took me a while of struggling to continue the linear progression of weight gain to start implementing the five tips I outlined above, but when I did, eating became a lot more enjoyable, and easier. Like they say, “Compliance is the science.” So get to eating, but eating smart, and in a manner that stimulates hunger, and not alleviate it.",IMPROVING APPETITE,"IMPROVING APPETITE  Thought this might be an interesting read for the kids on here trying to break through weight plateaus.

I do not have a problem with appetite anymore. There is a number of strategies I have implemented to help getting the food down. I hope the tips that I have accrued throughout this offseason help you out and allow you to get more food down the hatch.

1. PROTEIN IS VERY SATIATING. I started my last prep at 280g of protein per day. That’s a lot of protein for an 82kg person. No wonder I was struggling to finish my meals (I always did though. Despite having to force it down.) The protein was too excessive for my bodyweight. However, I didn’t get my protein that high on purpose. It happened by default when I was upping my carbs. The small amounts of protein you get from carbs such as rice, potatoes and pastas all add up. When I was increasing the calories, I mistakenly kept my serving size of meat for each meal the same. This ended up me continually adding protein to my diet beyond the point of it being excessive. Even a lot of fat sources contain quite a high amount of protein. Fats like nuts and cheese add protein as well. So the approach I took this year was this. Keep protein at 1g/2.5-3x BW in kg. When upping carbs, drop volume of meat per meal to suit with the added protein I’m getting from that meals carb source. Keep in mind, carbohydrates are protein sparring, so especially in a calorie abundant environment, having a little less protein from animal sources won’t be detrimental to progress. It will be helpful, because you’ll be able to get more carbs down. Unlike protein, carbohydrates are appetite stimulating. Leaving you hungrier and ready for your next meal. Every 60 days, I readjust my Fat and Protein numbers to suit my new bodyweight. This usually only makes for a small increase of 5-8g for each. Like I mentioned in a previous blog, my fats stay right around 1g/1kg BW. So keeping fats low and protein moderate, allows me to eat the least satiating macro more, allowing for continuous calorie progression, and no feeling of bloat or distension.
2. 10 MINUTE WALKS. A common problem that people struggling to consume enough calories due to being too full is not efficiently digesting what they’re eating. The first step is to eat foods that you can digest easily. And then consider going for a brisk 10 minute walk following that meal. Improve digestion, improve appetite, also, improve metabolism.
3. Stan Efferding’s patent pending MONSTER MASH. A way I have found making very large meals less intimidating is by making it into a mash by adding roughly 30 mL of chicken broth to it. It makes the large meal SO much easier to eat. It’s almost like the meal is already chewed up for you, you just need to send it down the hatch. Chicken broth has a lot of health and immunity benefits, but it also makes for meals that sit real easy in the stomach, and somehow, probably magic, don’t fill you up. This make consuming 1,000 calories in a sitting feel like Childs play.
4. IF YOU CANT EAT ALL YOUR CARBS, THEN DRINK ‘EM! I use orange juice. 3 times a day, 500mL each. 50g of carbs, 215 calories, fucking delicious. This makes for 150g of carbs, 645 kcal a day just from liquid. It is as satiating as 500 mL of water. Go figure. Plus, loaded with micronutrients.
5. SMALLER, MORE FREQUENT MEALS. No science or research papers to back this one up. The way I see it is simple. I want to look like a bodybuilder, so, i’ll eat like one. Provide the body with a message, hopefully the body gets the message. Give the body enough cellular signalling to achieve the goals that you are intentionally providing it. If you want to fast all day and look like your hobbies include yoga and Prius conferences, then go for it. I find it difficult getting 5,000 calories in, in a 4 hour window. So my solution is simple. Do it the way the bodybuilders have done it from the start. Eat from the moment I get up, to before I go to bed.

This list is simple. Really simple. But it’s these little details that often get overlooked when assessing ones diet. Constant overfeeding, in my opinion, leads to blown-out midsections and enlarged waists. I feel like I fell prey to this after only a year of force feeding. I started the mass phase very lean, got to power-shovelling the food, ate beyond satiation, dieted back down, and my waist was noticeably larger then before. If you’re digesting your food properly, hunger levels follow as a result. If you’re NOT hungry for your next meal, instead of forcing the next one day, firstly, address why it is that you’re not hungry. If you were breaking down food efficiently, you’d be ready to eat every single time that next meal was knocking on your bodybuilding goals door. 

As a side note, Pro Tan emphasises that SHIT out of stretch marks. Blow out your waist? Better get comfortable with the stretch marks on the glutes, hips, lower back and lower abs to stick out like dogs balls.

There’s no such thing as a hard gainer. Every single person that i’ve conversed with who self-diagnosis’ themselves as struggling to put on weight, is simply put, not even close to trying hard enough. Force feeding is really uncomfortable, but it’s not the only means of getting those needed calories down. Learn to choose foods that you can eat in large quantities, pick foods that are extremely dense in calories, and address digestion issues. If the scale isn’t moving upwards, it’s not because you’re a hard gainer, it’s because it doesn’t mean enough to you. To actually illicit some change in bodyweight, you may have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It took me a while of struggling to continue the linear progression of weight gain to start implementing the five tips I outlined above, but when I did, eating became a lot more enjoyable, and easier. Like they say, “Compliance is the science.” So get to eating, but eating smart, and in a manner that stimulates hunger, and not alleviate it."

1,"All the stuff swirling around regarding rest days seems totally anecdotal. Lots of vague mentions of benefits that often seem to relate to the mental side of people. Maybe I'm a freak but I absolutely love picking up weight throughout the day. When I feel like I can do another set I go for it. I love the feeling of having a pump at all times.

So what's up with all these rest days? I searched for studies and the few I found seemed to be comparing one group with rest days to another without rest days... with the same total volume!

If you don't take rest days you can creep your volume up on what you would have done wasting all that time. The studies don't take that into account probably because then they are comparing apples to oranges. But it seems to me the non-rest days people are going to just get more volume in over the long haul. They will be grabbing bigger weights at the end of the month. A car not stopping every other day is going to go much father, it seems to me. All the stuff on the web refers to factors like the fact that people will apparently flake out if they have to do something every day. Well, whatever. That doesn't answer the question of whether working out continually would actual lead to greater gains. For those of you who are going to say I am obviously not working out intensely enough... I'm not so sure their 2 or 3 sessions on the same muscle group is really getting them as far as 6 or 7 would. So, can any one point me to any facts about this?

1,"Hey all,

Just wanted to drop in and say I just finished my first ever bulk. 

Started this bulk cycle at 190lb on July 1st after having lost 150lb from my peak weight of 340lb back in June of 2019.

Losing that much weight left a lot of loose skin, but I'm working on slowly filling it out with muscle.  https://imgur.com/gallery/WtJMxxE

During this time, I ate at a 500kcal surplus to put on a pound per week. Originally, I had planned on stopping my bulk Jan 1st, but was convinced by u/mythicalstrength to keep going, as there is ""never a wrong time to bulk"". So, I kept it going for an extra two months.

From Mid Jan to Mid Feb, I focused primarily on strength and powerlifting, as my gym has a 1000lb club (combined total lifts between deadlift, squat, and bench all are 1000+lb).

I figured as a home-stretch goal, I wanted to hit those numbers. At the time, however, I was about 25lb short, so I found a peaking program solely based around 4 weeks of growing your 1RM. I increase my calories, started this program, and lifted away.

I am happy to say that at the end of those 4 weeks, I managed to get my goal of hitting 1000lb. https://imgur.com/gallery/SmfFfrN

Ultimately, I'm super happy with my progress. 40lb is a lot of weight to gain, a bunch of fat, but a bunch of is also muscle, so for my first bulk, I'm super happy. Looking forward to cutting for a while to strip away excess body fat. 

Thanks for all your continued support and encouragement!  💕💕💕

EDIT: 

The mod would like food and meal info. So, here goes:

For calories, I ate a total of 3,250/day. Sometimes slightly more. Overall, just making sure I was getting enough calories. I stopped really caring about the scale, as I started weighing myself month instead of weekly, as I really just cared about eating to fuel recovery and growth.

Generally, I get about 220gr of protein a day. That's mainly greek yogurt, lunch meat, some type of lean meat like pork loin, protein scoop in my oatmeal in the morning, protein shake after lifting, and that's mainly it for consistent protein sources. 

The rest of the calories could be whatever. But usually I ate the same thing every day:

Breakfast - 1 cup oatmeal in water with a scoop of protein powder. If I was working out that day, I'd eat about an extra 100kcal of fruit.

Lunch - Two wraps on low carb bread, with 200~ calories of meat, some cheese, some mayo, veggies. If I was working out that day, I'd slam about 6 large marshmallows about 30 minutes before lifting.

Dinner - Either huge bowl of stir fried veggies on rice or with meat. Hebrew National Hot dogs... giant chunk of pork loin... whatever.

Snackies - This is where I ate most of my calories, and almost always at night. Usually ends up being about 1200-1500 calories of snacks into the late evening starting around 8p. This might be a big ass bowl of popcorn, some greek yogurt, left overs, bagels, cheese, fudgsicles, whatever. My nights are usually watching something with the wife or playing nerd games, so I'm usually snacking.

I've read here that its mostly about total volume, but I've also read that it's nice to get close to failure, and these seem slightly contradictory (I could spread out chest around bi's to possibly hit a bit more chest reps, with more time to rest).

Just curious what the views are on this"

1,"[PHAT](https://simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) worked well for me in the past. **Is there a similar power/hypertrophy high volume routine that is more home-gym friendly?**

Unfortunately, some of the assistive/auxiliary exercises in PHAT I can't do here, either because I don't have the equipment or they would make too much noise in my apartment if they involve dropping weights or slamming the weights on the catches. 

Here's the exercises I'm looking for alternatives for. 

- Hack Squats. 
 - I know there's a free weight version, but it's essentially like a deadlift where the plates would hit the floor.
 - Trying to learn how to front-squat in the meantime. 
- Leg Extensions
 - Sissy squats? But I heard those are really bad for your knees
- Leg curls
 - ?
- Leg Press
 - ?

- Lying leg curls
 -  - I can try and do banded lying leg curls, but looking for something better

I don't have much experience with lunges, so I don't know which ones to do or or their set schemes.

- Seated Cable Row
 - I tried using bands, but they're not strong enough

- Close Grip Pull Downs
  - Kinda can do it with the bands if I go extra light and do more isometric squeezes. Dumbbell pullovers put too much strain on my shoulders :(

- Lat pull down
 - Bands definitely don't work for this either. I end up just doing assistive pull-ups and try to do isometric holds to get a similar effect.


A lot of free-weight versions of these assistive/auxiliary exercises are already in the program. Like bent-over/pendly rows, stiff leg/RDL for hamstrings, etc... Should I just do more sets of those exercises?","Going to start PHAT again, but some of the exercises require equipment I don't have at home. I mostly just have free weights.

When I started working out, I was somewhere around 70kg (no doubt the biggest part of my weight gain is because of my diet not being perfect, though I'm not a junkfood junky at all).

In the time I have been working out, I have seen changes, but in my opinion, they aren't going fast enough. I'm doing what I think is right, but sometimes I do think to myself: ""Is this the right way? Should I be doing something else? Or maybe do something different with my weights/diet?"". Therefore, I am now asking it here, to give myself the general idea of things I'm doing wrong and things I'm doing good. Also, I have been working out at home all the time, so the only equipment I have are dumbbells and a bench which basically can't incline/decline.

To give an idea of my workout, I exercise every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. All other days I basically don't workout, at best I take a walk for about 30 minutes. Here is my schedule:

**Tuesday: Triceps/Chest/Legs - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 12kg each.**

* Bench press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Dips - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squeeze press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squats - 3 sets of 10
* Tricep Kickback - 3 sets of 8 on each arm
* Bicep Curl - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* One Arm Tricep Extension - 3 sets of 8 on each arm
* Calf Raise - 3 sets of 15

**Thursday: Legs/Biceps/Triceps - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 12kg each.**

* Push-ups - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Bench press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squeeze press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Lunges - 2 sets of 12 on each leg
* Bicep Curls - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Hammer Curls - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squats - 3 sets of 10
* One Arm Tricep Extension - 3 sets of 8 on each arm

**Saturday: Shoulders/Back - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 10kg each (my shoulders and back are a bit weaker than the rest).**

* Overhead Press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Bent-Over - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Wide-grip Upright Row - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Arnold Press - 2 sets of 10, then 1 set of 8
* Bench Bent-Over - 2 sets of 12 on each arm
* Front Raise - 2 sets of 10, then 1 set of 8 and 1 set of 6 (This one is a bit hard for me to complete all 4 sets properly)
* Shrugs - 3 sets of 15

I basically do all exercises with 30 seconds rest between sets and 90 seconds rest between exercises. Now, finally, the thing I am wondering: Is this the good way to go? For sure my diet can be changed, in fact it probably needs to be changed, but is that the sole reason that I find my ""gains"" to be too slow? Or am I taking these exercises on in a very wrong way, making it harder for myself?

I hope you guys can help me out on this one, as I'm willing to work for it, regardless of fast or slow results!","Since I barely know anything about the science behind fitness, can anybody help me here to see if I am on the right track?","Since I barely know anything about the science behind fitness, can anybody help me here to see if I am on the right track?

Title says it all- I’ve been lifting for a long time but I’ve spent a most of that time doing three things- 
1. Crash dieting to the 130-140 lb range, once to 127 lbs, sometimes maintaining this for 4 months 
2. Subsequently getting injured (stress fractures, sprained ankles and wrists, pulled muscles) and losing drive for periods of 3-4 months  
3. Allowing myself to bulk, but soon ending up as fat as before and with barely any additional 
muscle, like 20%.


YEAR 1
Year 1, went from pretty lean , leaner than my oldest bodywhat pic, at about age 18 and 130 lbs, up to 145 lbs with higher bodyfat. I did my first cut 10-11 months into my first year, from 152 to 135. Overall my lifts went up year 1 from 90/160/115/160 ohp/sq/bench/dl up to about 120/270/190/365. Deadlift was with poor form and mixed grip.

YEAR 2-
 I hit ohp/sq/b/dl 130/290/200/420. Years 3-6 I fucked up repeatedly like above.. 2020 was the year I started to gain some common sense, being age 24. 


CURRENT STATS- 

Now, at 25, I’m stuck. My lifts are at a respectable level - s/bench/dl/ohp- estimated around 340/210/440/145. Haven’t tested bench this year though.
However , my body stats are 5’7.75” 165 lbs 21%-22% bodyfat (estimated with laser X-ray vision). 

More importantly, my damn arms and calves are tiny. I have about 13.5-14” flexed arms, 10.5” forearms, 13.25” calves, on a 7.3” ankle and 6” wrist frame. 

I train hard and end up feeling like an emptied toothpaste tube at the end of my workouts, and have an extremely good diet and sleep. I have normal to high testosterone, with all my tests ever ranging from 640-900, usually at 750 ng/dl.
I don’t know why I’m having so much trouble building muscle! It’s like I can only gain muscle on my ass, thighs, and shoulders, but even then, mostly fat.

1,"Hey all,

I've been gaining on and off for roughly two years. Making progress and losing it due to work/stress. Now that work has finally died down I want to go full forward and gain 30-40lbs. Now my question is, is varying my calorie intake depending on what I did that day okay? 

I get it might not be the most effective but I have trouble getting my 4000kcal intake on weekends where my days have little to no structure, unlike during the work week where I get up and get home at the same time. Hours will pass by on the weekend I will have forgotten to eat.

Now my 4000kcal intake is due to the nature of my work - im walking 20km a day usually, and my intake has to reflect that. On the weekends I'd much rather stomach 2800kcal and still be in a surplus, since I do very little walking, and hopefully still be gaining.

Is there any deficit to this? Or can something like this work?",Varying caloric intake by day?,"Varying caloric intake by day? Hey all,

In December, After talking with a couple people and self-reflecting I realized it wasn’t working, and started using Arnold’s basic beginner program #1 using higher weight around 40-60 depending on the exercise, and 15 pounds for dumbbells

Current day, I have to be honest with saying I’ve seen no real progression, and it pisses me off that I have wasted so much time, and I blame no one but myself for not taking time to do proper research. I’ve chalked it up to a few things:

Diet: I never was keeping track of what I was eating, and I really can’t be eating so much since Im apart of a relatively big family and can’t be eating, say 3-5 eggs for breakfast a day. I also am pretty limited to whatever my parents make for dinner. As for breakfast and lunch, I have been eating things such as oatmeal, cottage cheese, eggs, etc + breakfast at school as it’s now free where I live.

Weight, reps, sets: I mentioned the weight I’ve been using earlier, and as for reps I’ve been trying 6-8 for 4 sets, but I’m unsure if any of this is right as I find my arms giving out way to early into the sets for an exercise.

Days spent lifting: I’ve always lifted weights Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but I’m considering lifting weights 5 days out of the week instead of just three.

At this point, I’m basically still a beginner. I could use any advice from anyone out there, as I have no idea how to get efficient results.

I'll start off with a bit of information:
I am a 16 year old male who is trying to gain weight and tone up. I am currently 6'4"" and weigh around 143 pounds (I know, I'm underweight). 

I work out 6 days a week on average and my routine consists of:

• Pushups (around 50 throughout the day)

• Crunches (2 sets of 25)

• Leg raises ( 2 sets of 30)

• One minute plank

• V sit ups (3 sets of 10)

• Bicep curls (3 sets of 8)

• Squats (3 sets of 10)

Now for the main point of this post. I obviously need to gain weight and my goal is to get to around 160 pounds or so. Should I just be eating as much as possible without taking the quality and health benefits of the food into consideration, or should I be eating nutritious meals?

1,"Hi all, I humbly request advice.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a 20 year old college student. I've been ""seriously"" training since summer of 2019, so about 1.5 years now. I got my numbers up (starting from the bar) for about a semester before that first summer, but didn't really have any idea about nutrition or programming. I didn't have much sports background before, and was very skinny (5'8 138 lb), so I essentially started from nothing. I made OK progress initially (both visually and strength). I lost record of my numbers, but by September 2020, my SBD was likely around 300/190/(spent a long time practicing form for deadlifts), at 168 lb. Up till this point, I was using the nSuns 5 day routine, but had seen diminishing returns and it was getting boring, so I switched to the CoolCicada PPL routine, but kept the nSuns squat layout for the leg days. 

&amp;nbsp;

By November, I had gotten my squat to a max of 345 once (highest working set was 315x4 a week before that max attempt), and bench didn't really increase much--I did 205 with poor, grindy form once, but from September to November, general working sets for the heavier bench day only went from 155 5x5 to 165 5x5. Continued practicing deadlifts and got closer to 300 with solid form.

&amp;nbsp;

I was slightly depressed/lethargic at home for break, and did a couple of weeks of traveling with just body weight exercises, so I pretty much just maintained until January, still doing the PPL routine. Since I had been bulking for the entirety of my lifting journey and was getting a bit fluffier at 177lb, I decided to cut, and since I was not really seeing much progress with a linear program, I also concurrently began Candito's 6 week ""intermediate"" program mixed with his bench program since I needed more practice with bench. Starting that program, I entered my 1RMs at 320/200/300, since I was still feeling slightly rusty from winter break. Currently in the middle of week 5 of the program (and of my cut), and I've lost 8-9 pounds back to 168, and my strength is pretty much the same as 5 weeks before, which is fine. I have to admit, I rarely tracked calories when I bulked--I ate similar whole foods daily, and was gaining weight at a relatively slow pace. Since starting my cut, I've been eating around 2k-2.1k calories daily, about 180g P, 200g C, and 50g F, and walking to and from campus a total of 3 miles 5 days a week.

&amp;nbsp;

During the previous few weeks and last semester, I would never miss a training session, try my best during those sessions, am cognizant about improving form, would eat in a surplus with enough protein, sleep an average of 7 hours, and have done a lot of research on nutrition and training. Yet, I'm not satisfied with my progress both visually and strength-wise. Week to week, I'm not so discouraged by my strength not increasing, since I understand it takes time, but looking back at the last 6+ months, it is a bit disheartening to see minimal progress even as I (think I) put in the work. I compared a progress pictures in the same lighting, pose, and no-pump from today and October, and I can see essentially no difference. I understand progress typically slows as one trains for longer, but seeing as how I'm still so early on my journey, I expected more significant change. Obviously, I'm not giving up and will continue to train with intent.

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice or recommended resources? I'd love to hear some perspectives on how to move forward, and welcome any and all critiques as long as it's constructive. My current goals are to build a more substantive muscular base and improve strength. Thank you all very much!",Minimal Progress--Why?,"Minimal Progress--Why? Hi all, I humbly request advice.

1,"First post so forgive me. I follow a modified 6 day PPL routine where my workouts generally last about 2 hours, sometimes longer. I generally try to aim for 5-6 exercises per muscle group of 4 sets each and realized this may be excessive and hindering my muscle growth. I'm about 6'3 and 200 pounds but still feel pretty skinny. I've upped weights in my bench, squat, etc. over the past few months but I feel like I may be overdoing it.

Ok I’m technically 176.6 lol but yesterday I was 176.8 so I’m calling it 177. I’m 31 yrs old. By October after the gyms had been shut for going on 6 months I felt so ashamed of my physique, I had been living a lazy lifestyle and drinking way, way too much and sleeping in. Gyms opened back up and I started hitting the gym consistently, gained 5lb in about a month and started feeling good again. Then before I knew it, gyms shut down again, and I promptly lost those gains.

Mid-January came around and the gyms were back open. I’ve hit the gym 22 times in the last 40 days and am seeing some results. I’m on Kinobody’s Greek God program, which is a 3 day split. It’s more or less a pull, push, legs/traps split. I decided 3x a week wasn’t enough for me so I’m adding in another 1-2 days a week for mobility, and to do a little extra neck and traps work. Working neck is something I overlooked for years.

What I Ate because this is r/gainit:

 I did shakes at the beginning but never twice a day and they never amounted over 1k calories probably because laziness. After about 2-3 months I transitioned fully into drinking half a gallon of fairlife milk a day, since then it’s basically been impossible for me to miss protein any day. If anything I tend to go way overboard and have been working on cutting back protein intake. I also made sure to get 4-8 servings of vegetables everyday (mostly spinach) because they made me feel good. Boring chicken and rice a lot but I’ve never really cared about what I ate before so it didn’t matter much to me as long as I hit my macros. I ate 3-6 eggs everyday because I read somewhere they’re filled with micros and immediately trusted that source. I work a physical job so easy access foods were important for those 8 hours, this is when I drank the milk and ate about 900 calories worth of almonds, cashews, and dark chocolate. I incorporated variety at some points but milk, nuts, dark chocolate, eggs, chicken, rice, and spinach were the most frequently consumed foods. I also tracked my calories pretty religiously for 4/5 months but in the past month I’ve gotten lazy and am still gaining around the right amount so that’s nice. 

What I do at the gym:

Slight case of fuckarounditis but I do go to the gym 5 days a week doing a PPLUL split and I train very very hard. Also did 0 direct ab training in this time.

Thoughts about gaining so far:

I can’t stress how much I prefer not having to hear how skinny I am everyday, that was pretty annoying. Other guys seem to respond better to me now, the girl response is mostly the same as before. Around maybe 10ish people in my day to day life have noticed, and like 3/4 ar the gym I go to regularly. I think I’m going to go to 160 and then cut for the summer, but that depends on my satisfaction with my lifts. For some reason I don’t care that much about the bulk belly I have or the fat I gained despite family members pointing it out all the time.

I'm thinking of resting for half a week, resuming, then seeing how I feel. If niggles persist, I will take off another half week. If still persisting, a full week.

So I’ve got my breakfast routine sorted. Posted previously about breakfast prep, and since discovered burritos. 100g beef, 2 x eggs &amp;amp; peppers, 1 x hash brown, cheese, hot sauce, tortilla. Bulk prep. In the freezer. Done for the week. Awesome. Circa. 550 calories, 45g protein each. Mixed with my breakfast shake, it’s circa. 1,100 calories and 85g protein before I’ve even got to midday.

However, mind is now going to how to improve lunches and prep for them (as work full time). They’re ok at the moment, but could be better and less time consuming. Don’t want a huge lunch as would prefer to have bigger dinner after all the calories at breakfast. To fit in with my goals, lunch only needs to be around 400/500 calories and 30g protein.

One of the big things that puts me off prepping a week of lunches is I really despise the taste of reheated microwave chicken.

Are there any recipes that you can suggest that avoid this? Or any general tips? Maybe my pre-prepared chicken needs to be in a sauce / broth kind of situation to avoid / mask that awful dry / chemical taste when reheating chicken? Or maybe I should just stick with another meat? But just don’t want to be eating beef 3 x times a day as that will get old. Turkey I’m not a fan of at all. I do like ham though but not sure it’s the best meat for bulking?

Picture on the far left is about 6 months ago, middle picture is 2 months ago, and right picture was from yesterday.

I started my ""fitness journey"" after my break-up about 6 months ago.  I lost 30 lbs following IF 16:8 and doing some kind of physical activity daily (i.e., Greyskull LP with accessories &amp; cardio).  2 months ago I hit my ""goal weight"" and was starting to follow the LeanGains methodology to pack on some muscle.  Unfortunately, in those 2 months I haven't seen much progress; my lifting numbers and PRs have gone up, but not a lot of physical changes.  I have been eating at a very slight surplus with 1 gram of protein per body weight (i.e., 140 grams).

I'm going to start a ""classic"" bulk of 500 surplus calories daily.  Going from eating less to lose weight to eating a lot more to gain muscle has been a challenge, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.

I'm following 5/3/1 for Beginners now with a fair amount of accessories.

1,"Hi everyone, yesterday marked exactly 3 months of my fitness and gaining routine, so I thought I’d share my progress so far. 

https://imgur.com/a/7J0Ne0x (last 3 pics are within 2 days of each other, just different lighting) 

I don’t track my calories to the exact amount, but always make sure I’m getting above 3k per day, and usually around 180-200 grams of protein. My diet is nothing different than the hundreds of posts you see on this subreddit, so not gonna touch on that, but I will say that mass gainer shakes helped out immensely the first month or so when adjusting to a bigger diet.

Unfortunately I have only had access to a smith machine so can’t really compare these numbers to a true barbell lift, but: 

Bench: 145 1rm - 215 1rm

Squat: 185 1rm - 265 1rm 

I’ve noticed consistent growth in all of the accessory lifts I’ve done as well so happy about that. 

Routine
————-
4 day split:

-Chest and Tris 

-Back and Bis

-Legs

-Shoulders, Bis and Tris

-Rest


Goals
———

Short term (Daily/Weekly)

-Weigh myself every morning to get a consistent weekly average of weight 

-Hit 3200+calories per day or more depending on weight measurements

-Gain between .5lb-1lb per week


Medium Term: (3-12 months)

-Hit a true 225 bench press

-Hit a true 315 squat 

-Hit 190 weight 

-Join a new gym with free barbells so I can incorporate deadlift and OHP into my routine 


Long term: (1 year +)

-200 lb weight

-successfully go through a gaining/cutting cycle 
-1000 lb club 


Conclusion
——————
Overall I’ve learned a lot the last 3 months thanks to this subreddit and my brother who is an advanced lifter. I’m happy with the gains I’ve made in all of my lifts and looking forward to hitting new goals that I set for myself. Also thinking about joining the lifting party on March 1 and riding that out for the next 3-6 months!",[Progress] M/24/6’3’’ | 162 lbs - 177 lbs | November - February,"[Progress] M/24/6’3’’ | 162 lbs - 177 lbs | November - February Hi everyone, yesterday marked exactly 3 months of my fitness and gaining routine, so I thought I’d share my progress so far. 

https://imgur.com/a/7J0Ne0x (last 3 pics are within 2 days of each other, just different lighting) 

I don’t track my calories to the exact amount, but always make sure I’m getting above 3k per day, and usually around 180-200 grams of protein. My diet is nothing different than the hundreds of posts you see on this subreddit, so not gonna touch on that, but I will say that mass gainer shakes helped out immensely the first month or so when adjusting to a bigger diet.

1,"Hello everyone, today I post here to explain my particular situation and to maybe get some help!
I'm 18yo and have always been really skinny (like really) and I decided to go to the gym since 1.5years now and went from around 55kg to 70kg. (1m76-77 -&gt; 1m81
The problem is that I did gain a lot of muscle but I also gained some FAT.
I was more around 11% bf before and now I'm more at like 15% and I feel like it starts to be a bit too much.

The thing is that I want to lose this extra fat so I know that I should just go on a fat loss.
The thing is that I don't want to be back to like low 60kgs because I would be so skinny again and I just don't want to be THAT skinny anymore.
Honestly, having a bodyfat of around 11% would be perfectly fine for me but I'm really afraid of losing all my gains.
It may be obvious but I have a fast metabolism which means that it was always hard for me to bulk.

I know that my situation is hard to deal with but if you could help in any way, I would be really thankful.

Im sure I will be able to continue making gains on my squats and deads considering they are so low. But I'm curious about more ways to increase my bench during my cut if the volume starts to become too taxing. I want to reach a 330 Bench by july.

1,"Hey guys! I \[21/M/5'9""/115 lbs\] have  been struggling for about 6 or so years now to gain weight since my  growth spurt stopped. While I have tried calorie packing countless  times, I have never really had success. However, I have recently found  myself being able to eat and drink many more calories recently. While I  don't want to dwell too much, I think that this may be due to having  online college classes and having more time than ever to cook full meals  that I enjoy. Usually, I have felt too rushed to eat much for breakfast  at all, but nowadays, I have a routine of eating a sizeable breakfast  every day (a few eggs, toast, butter, and sometimes yogurt), and I have  also started drinking 2-4 cups of whole fat chocolate milk per day  (which I hope to increase over the next coming weeks).

My  experience tells me however that I will soon probably lose the ability  to stuff myself everyday no matter how hard I try since I start to enjoy  even the thought of food less and less with how much I am eating. I  feel like there might be a point where my appetite starts to increase  again if I continue to push myself, but my appetite has usually  significantly dropped off before this theoretical point.

How  do I avoid succumbing to this setback like I have pretty much always  done? While it is relatively easy for me to eat 3 large meals with  snacks in between per day at the moment, I know that this can wake up  any day with a totally different appetite which ultimately derails the  streak that I am on.","How to deal with appetite ""setbacks""?","How to deal with appetite ""setbacks""?

While I have tried calorie packing countless  times, I have never really had success. However, I have recently found  myself being able to eat and drink many more calories recently. While I  don't want to dwell too much, I think that this may be due to having  online college classes and having more time than ever to cook full meals  that I enjoy. Usually, I have felt too rushed to eat much for breakfast  at all, but nowadays, I have a routine of eating a sizeable breakfast  every day (a few eggs, toast, butter, and sometimes yogurt), and I have  also started drinking 2-4 cups of whole fat chocolate milk per day  (which I hope to increase over the next coming weeks).

My  experience tells me however that I will soon probably lose the ability  to stuff myself everyday no matter how hard I try since I start to enjoy  even the thought of food less and less with how much I am eating. I  feel like there might be a point where my appetite starts to increase  again if I continue to push myself, but my appetite has usually  significantly dropped off before this theoretical point.

How  do I avoid succumbing to this setback like I have pretty much always  done? While it is relatively easy for me to eat 3 large meals with  snacks in between per day at the moment, I know that this can wake up  any day with a totally different appetite which ultimately derails the  streak that I am on."

Hi,

24M 5’7 135 lbs

Wanted to ask for some opinions:

I used to work out at least twice a week for my entire life (have been lifting recreationally since I’m 15) and was stable at around 145 lbs that way. Now after last March everything changed and I stopped working out almost completely.

I started having some GI problems around March too that I still have to this date. Now my question is: how realistic is it to lose 10 lbs of muscle/glycogen/water over this period?

I look at myself in the mirror today and can barely recognize myself. My legs look very skinny and my arms too. I wasn’t swole by any means, but I was definitely in decent shape (no visible abs, but solid back and arms for example).

I’ve been worried that all this weight I’ve lost has been from my GI issues, but I just realized some of it could be muscle too.

Did anyone else lose such a large amount of mass just from not working out during 2020?

Cheers!",Is 10lbs muscle loss due to inactivity possible?,"Is 10lbs muscle loss due to inactivity possible?

Hey guys it’s me again lmao if any of you remember me from over six months ago! 

Conversions for metric people: 56-72.3kg

For my routine, I just roughly follow the r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine and added some dumbbell exercises with adjustable weights for progressive overload. Feel free to DM or comment to ask more haha. Also, I dance three times a week for around 2-3 hours each time. 

Honestly for me I just workout every other day before I sleep, and with school and everything I can’t be bothered to follow a full on routine with what some of you guys have here. For me I just want to establish the habit of working out and enjoying it so in the future I can take up different routines more easily and progress from there. I’m still 16 and I don’t want to put so much thought into this just yet so this is me not really taking this whole thing overly seriously. 

In the last post, (it’s in my profile still you guys can go check haha) some of you guys commented on the carb/sugar stuff so I really tried to watch that. I lost some weight after that to cut down on the fat and now I’m trying to gain weight again but I’m being more careful this time. What really helps for me recently was weighing everyday to see if I was gaining a sensible amount. 

For 2021, I really made it a point to not skip workouts or at least get something in on my workout days, since consistency is so important and it’s something I lacked last year which slowed my progress. 

Right now I’m still trying to gain weight but I’m really watching the fat and I’ll cut down once summer nears. 

I hope my post inspires someone to at least start or helps anyone low on motivation

1,"Hi all, I come seeking advice and wisdom for helping me with a new problem with squats. TL;DR at the bottom but I feel the whole story may help out in finding an answer.

Up unto February of last year I could squat fine no problem and had a one rep of 245 (yea not the best I know). That February though I injured my back, doing squats coincidentally (lost tension in my core because I lost focus and rounded my back forward with 205lb on), and had to take about 5 months off the gym. I was in the worse back pain I'd ever had and it still bothers me most days.

I started back at the gym early August last year and have only really gotten back into ""heavy"" weights about two months ago. Things are going fine for the most part, but I notice now when I squat, on the come up my knees buckle and go inwards into each other. Like I'll get down to full depth fine but coming back up my legs are like a newborn deer, with my knees always caving into each other/wobbling. Not sure how else to describe it so sorry for the vague description.

I've tried doing more hip flexor exercises as well as lower back work and volume days (5x12) for squats but the problem persists. It's holding me back a good bit. Even today I wanted to test where my one rep was at and even with only 185lb my knees/legs were wobbling. At 205 I couldn't get back up at all. Any idea where I'm lagging or what I should be working on?

Hi guys, back with another annual progress thread!

This is a follow-up from this post I made two years ago where you can read more about me and my story: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress\_m2159\_110lbs\_50kg\_152lbs\_69kg\_1\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress_m2159_110lbs_50kg_152lbs_69kg_1_year/)

And: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/fbs820/progress\_m2259\_110lbs\_50kg\_156lbs\_707kg\_2\_years/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/fbs820/progress_m2259_110lbs_50kg_156lbs_707kg_2_years/)

**Since the last post, I've gained another 4 lbs this year and have made huge strength and aesthetic gains.**

I still eat the exact same stuff as stated in my post from a year back. However, I sometimes incorporate pork and the odd ""cheat meal"" from time to time, which tend to cause me issues the following days. I won't be doing this anymore from now.

I've since learned that it's important to be grateful for what you CAN eat, even if it's not much. And also the fact that I live a (mostly) pain-free life without meds after my surgeries and daily routine consisting of eating the same foods and taking turmeric, Boswellia, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, propolis, Salmon fish oil, creatine, L-glutamine, working out (and lots of walking outdoors), and a regular sleeping schedule.

**CURRENT:** [https://imgur.com/a/RtW2Q3s](https://imgur.com/a/RtW2Q3s) **(160lbs / 72.5kg) 23 years old**

&amp;#x200B;

**My workout routine has changed significantly:**

* 10 sets of my max push-ups and shrugs per day (with a tiny 40lbs dumbbell held in both hands, need to upgrade asap). I do this for two days in a row. So about 350-400 push-ups and shrugs with perfect form, really taking my time to do the exercise rather than just chasing numbers.
* 10 sets of my max super wide-grip TOWEL pull-ups and bicep curls. I am going to post a pic later of how I set it up at home. So about 70-80 pull-ups and 50-60 curls with a 40lbs dumbbell. Incredible strength gains in my back, forearms, fingers, and grip overall.

That's it. I do a lot of walking for my legs and also some basic mobility exercises with a resistance band, one-legged calf ""jumping"" raises, and jumping lunges.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some word of advice after many years of doing this:**

* Do stuff that's hard. The numbers don't matter and are subjective. If you can't do more than 5 push-ups in one go, doing 50 per day is going to skyrocket your gains in the next month, then you can move on to more and more to continue offering the same challenge to your body as before
* Perfect form every single time. Humping the ground or looking like you're doing the worm will do little to help you advance along the way. 20 reps with perfect form are way better than 40 half-assed attempts
* For those with digestive issues - calculate your calories needed to bulk up, then experiment until you find your safe foods. Blood tests may be needed regularly at first to make sure you're not increasing your inflammation levels. I'm lucky to be able to eat white bread and not be gluten intolerant, I can't tolerate most fats, but I can eat a shit ton of tahini (sesame paste), so the majority of my calories come from there. The rest are from chicken and rice. I don't calculate macros, but they're probably something like 45% carbs, 35% fats, 20% protein
* If you're easily bored with long, varied routines like me (I know that's a paradox in itself) just find a few exercises that really work well for you and spam the shit out of them
* Researchers constantly come up with contradicting studies. Don't go down the rabbit hole of listening to dudes that spend more time researching the best way to gain muscle and then arguing about it over actually working out. All of those that I know irl think I'm fucking with them when I tell them that I don't go to the gym and only do push-ups and pull-ups

P.S. Can't recommend shaving your head and growing some facial hair enough! I used to be super-feminine looking but now just looking at myself in the mirror finally gives me satisfaction and a ""damn, you kinda look manly"" feeling, which I've read can actually increase your testosterone levels (the looking at yourself in the mirror with a beard part). I'll link up the study later.

1,"I mainly ask because I’ve worked up to 150 for 4 sets of 5 on bench and I haven’t been progressing past that. As a matter of fact it’s beginning to get really difficult, as in each session is more difficult than the last even though I’m doing the same amount of volume and weight.

I’m considering doing a deload next week and working up again but I’ve been told that “beginners shouldn’t deload”. I’ve been working out for about 7-8 months so I’m a beginner but not a complete beginner and I’ve also seen mostly linear progression until recently, so would a deload benefit me? 

Also I should add that all my workouts are feeling much more difficult lately despite not increasing the weight nor volume for the last few weeks or so. And before you say it yes I have looked at other factors, my diet has an adequate amount of protein and I’m in a caloric surplus, and I’m getting good enough sleep most nights (still working on that).",Should I deload as a beginner?,"Should I deload as a beginner?

1,"Hey guys, been progressing well on lifts, including bench, and I'm always very conscious of my form on bench to prevent RC injuries, yet sometimes post sets I still feel a little inflammation/warmth coming from the RC.  

&amp;#x200B;

My standard routine for bench is to warm up with shoulder swings, across the chest stretches, and then probably 10 reps of bench at 45, 5 reps at 95, 5 reps at 135, then whatever my rep/set-weight is.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm extremely conscious to squeeze my scapula together to be flat on the bench, and maintain that squeeze through the reps.  I use a grip that's fairly wide, about two fingers away from non-knurled ring, that allows for straight up and down forearm maintenance through the movement that hits my chest well.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I'll do a set of 3 175, feel a great pump in my chest, no pain in the RC, other times I'll do a set of 135 for 5 reps and find myself after slightly bothered by my RC.

I am a 15M (5'11"", 155LBS) who has been lifting seriously for about 8 months now, (1 year and half beforehand without proper programming). I also play baseball for my High School JV Baseball Team. Currently I am running a PPL split 6 days a week which has worked well for me and I have enjoyed it. I would regard myself as pretty well educated on fitness overall, spending the last year focusing on understanding nutrition and strength training and am currently bulking so the energy levels are though the roof.

However, with the beginning of the official season in a few weeks and my coach requiring me to lower my training, I have to transition to a 5 day program. My question is what is your advice on programming for those playing a sport while trying to lift at the same time? (Especially at the peak years for muscle building).

I spent the whole of 2020 losing weight. Dropped 40lbs to 147lb (Male, 5’11”) 

Got super lean through calorie deficit and cardio, around 10% body fat which was always my goal before I started lifting (yes I know I should have started lifting sooner!)

So now I’ve been lifting 5x per week since 1st December and since 1st Jan have been on a reverse diet. 

Finished my cut on 2000 cals/day and since then I have done:

2 weeks at 2200 (still lost weight)
2 weeks at 2400 (still lost weight) 

Now coming to the end of 2 weeks at 2700 and looks like I will gain around 1lb after the 2 weeks. 

But is this long enough to confirm I’m in a surplus? My brain is telling me no, if I lost weight at 2400 over 2 weeks then I’m not going to be gaining weight at 2700. 

Where I’m still a new lifter I think there’s an element of newbie muscle gain contributing to the ‘gain’ as well as the fact that my diet is a lot more carb heavy than it was when cutting. 

Would you do another 2 weeks at 2700 and then observe the results over 4 weeks? 

I’m REALLY wanting to dial in on my maintenance calories before I dive into ‘bulk mode’ as I want to make my bulk as lean as possible so it’s really important for me to not jump to the wrong conclusions. 

My training, including cardio volume, has been VERY consistent throughout this whole reverse diet phase. 

I’m using the average method of calculating my weight but my daily weight fluctuates so much that it can be hard to make sense even of the average over 1-2 weeks. 

For example my weight this week has ranged anywhere from 145.5lb to 149.7lb - so to use an average of the week to inform a decision about whether I’m in a net surplus/deficit seems a bit dangerous and easy to draw the wrong conclusions. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",Is 2 weeks long enough to confirm calorie surplus?,"Is 2 weeks long enough to confirm calorie surplus? Bit of background….

1,"Relatively new to the gym(about 7 months), did my first 8 week PPL program from October-december in which most days I benched it was 5 sets of 12-15, some days 10-12.

Howdy fellas, wanted to update my progress from about 6 months ago, definitely been on and off of training and eating, but also DEFINITELY been gaining mass. 
Eating less sets me back more than training less I would say, find it funny that a cheat day for me is when I only have 2 meals all day, the way my appetite is naturally.

The before photo literally scares me when I look at it, tbf I was suffering from some health issues but regardless, IF YOU’RE SKINNY EAT BIG AND TRAIN BIG, you’ll love and thank your self later.
I hopped out of the shower and literally just had to admire my progress I’m so thankful for learning about intricacies of caloric intake and workout programs on this sub.

Howdy fellas, wanted to update my progress from about 6 months ago, definitely been on and off of training and eating, but also DEFINITELY been gaining mass. 
Eating less sets me back more than training less I would say, find it funny that a cheat day for me is when I only have 2 meals all day, the way my appetite is naturally.

The before photo literally scares me when I look at it, tbf I was suffering from some health issues but regardless, IF YOU’RE SKINNY EAT BIG AND TRAIN BIG, you’ll love and thank your self later.
I hopped out of the shower and literally just had to admire my progress I’m so thankful for learning about intricacies of caloric intake and workout programs on this sub.

1,"Hi guys,

I am just wondering if anyone here has has issues with general stomach issues related to eating. For me, this is general discomfort and mild nasuea when I eat, sometimes with a little acid reflux on the side.

I know there are some types of foods that are tougher on the stomach, and I have done some research on things that should be avoided. The difficulty here is a lot of those things are high calorie/fat foods that are good for bulking. I have also heard that spreading eating across smaller meals throughout the day can help, but I think it is fair to say that for most people this is difficult to do with a regular work/life schedule. I don't have a crippling problem, I don't vomit after eating or wake up vomiting from heartburn. Its just bothersome enough that I have difficulty eating 3000+ calories in a day.

I have a good feeling most people here will suggest talking to my doctor about it, but I am just looking for some insight from anyone with similar experiences.

I should note that I am currently 6'2"" 163lbs or so. My max was around 185lbs, and during this time I was eating a lot, but it was still a struggle as I was often eating til I felt sick. With this pandemic I haven't been working out or eating as much and I have just recently begun making an effort to gain back some weight. But I'm noticing it is even more difficult than ever to eat a lot. I can feel like i'm not very ""full"" per se, but can't bring myself to eat anymore because I feel so bloated. Like I know there's room in there but my body is telling me it's not worth it.

I guess I'm just taking a shot in the dark here and wondering if someone in a similar situation was able to do something simple to allow them to either eat more or supplement macros in another way.

I work from home from 8-5pm and gotta get OUT of this chair more!! I'm in shape but in a huge rut for 3 months.

Here's my idea:

Start an interval timer right at 8am that will **loop all day**:

* **15 minutes**: Work (day job) for 15 straight minutes without interruption \*BEEP\*
* **1 minute**: Get up and Lift/Exercise  

   * Using dumbbells right behind my chair.
   * Can be any exercise as long as I'm hustling the entire minute. Will likely alternate between either a) same exercise all day or b) alternate muscle groups every cycle
   * Lifting for 1 minute is about 8-12 reps
* **4 minutes**: Remaining 4 minutes for break/bathroom/leisure

Then loop. So I would get 3 hard minutes of exercise every 60 minutes.

**8 hour work day = 24 minutes of exercise.**

Timeline: Get to school freshman year (150), bulk until sent home because of the covid second semester (185). I didn't work out or eat over the summer so started school sophomore year (170), bulk to thanksgiving (195), back to school after winter break (180) then to now (190). 

I didn't work out pretty much at all the entire summer of 2020. Gains are from basically 10 months in the gym spread out over a bit over a year. 

Lifts: 

Bench- 265

Squat- 315

Deadlift- 425

Overhead press- 145

&amp;#x200B;

Diet: Lots of pop tarts, peanut butter, cake, etc on top of the daily eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and tendies. 

Routine: Legs, back, chest. Don't really hit shoulders that much. Core mixed into leg day (sometimes). 1 day off a week. 

Going forward: up the intensity on leg day. For sure feel that I can put a few more pounds on my legs pretty easily to pick me up to 200. If I can clean up my diet but then again pop tarts taste good so probably not. Mixing in some cardio will also be nice but I like doing that from sports which are currently shut down. I May go back into rowing if I can get on the water but that won't be for a month or two. Current lifting goals are 5 plate deadlift, 4 plate squat, 3 plate bench press. Hopefully by end of summer.

The progress hasn't always been linear, and I have even fallen sick 2-3 times which messed with both my appetite and my weight.

1,"Hello all,

I'm currently on 5/3/1, and I did one day so far. I have DL and OHP today.

I was curious about the % of TMax it has you do. For the % it has to start at 40%. I cut that out, because that's barely a warmup. 

It gets as high as 85% TMax for 1xAMRAP with a minimum of 5. For squats, that was tough, but I banged out 7. I think Squats, it worked well, absolutely killed me. 

For Bench, it was almost too easy. Sure, I felt the burn, but banging them out was way too easy. For the 85% AMRAP, I did 11. Should I increase my TMAX or retest my 1RM? I thought it was accurate, but maybe it's not. 

We'll see how DL goes today. My max DL is 425, and I've been doing 3x5 of 365lb. Switching to this, I'm worried it'll be too easy, and at the EOM when I HOPE to have added 25lb to my lifts, I'm worried, it won't have increased as much as it could.

So, my question is:

Should I increase my TMax or %'s, or will 5/3/1 in this fashion, following the plan, actually increase my 1RM, because if I had to guess going by my bench, I'd say no.

1,"Hey folks, what with gyms being sporadically shut down every few months because of the pandemic, I'm sure a lot of you have a fairly solid plan b at home to keep the gain train rolling during lockdowns.

I'm no exception. I developed a workout, named ""death by pullups"" that I like to do on one of my pull days during the week. It added notable width to my lats in 10 weeks and I got way stronger at hauling my body vertically through space.

A few caveats to this: 

×I recommend warming your shoulders up extremely thoroughly prior to each time you do this. Scap depressions on a pull up bar, band pullaparts, low intensity band assisted pullups. Whatever you need to do.

×Run this progression linearly for maybe 8 weeks, then take a break. Do something else for your back work for a month. Then go back to it if you like. This can be stressful on the forearms and could lead to tendonitis of you do it for too long. I don't have a multi grip pull up bar at present, I suspect that if one did you could run the workout progression for longer.

*I do not recommend running this if you aren't already quite good at pullups. This is meant as a method to add goals for the intermediate ""puller"" to progress size and strength in a short period of time. Good form is of course a pre requisite, be honest with how you count reps. 

*The volume below may seem daunting. Trust me, if I can do it with very average genetics, you can too . Just remember to work hard and get that one more rep. As the plan dictates that you start with high weight and move down as the reps increase, the CNS is so fired up that the lighter weights seem so much easier even when the muscles are fatigued. 

×I don't recommend doing much else in the gym on the day you run this. Your lats are shattered, your grip is cooked, your bis are sautéed. 

Test your all out max bodyweight pullups /chinups before your run this. Then again after. I'd be shocked if you honestly don't add 10-12 reps. 


The programme is as follows:

5 rep sets:
-Start off with your weaker grip (overhand/underhand). 
-Pick a weight where the first set is an RPE 8ish
-Try your best to get 5 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, rinse and repeat. 
-If you get all 50 reps, add a small amount of weight next week. 

8 rep sets:
-Go back to your weak grip. 
-Pick a weight where you can get 8 reps, again RPE 8.
-Do 4 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, do 4 sets. 
-if all sets are completed, add a rep to as many sets as you can next time (only increase weight on these sets once you can do sets across with 10 reps). 

Bodyweight:
-You're beginning to see a pattern? 
- 3 sets, 12 reps on weak grip. 
-Rinse, repeat, strong grip. 

Band assisted 
-1 burnout set with your weak grip.

1,"Hey,

Been messing around I’m the gym for about a year (3 x 30min sessions a week, machines / cables) and have actually seen nice progress with my body.

However, feel i could genuinely look about 3 times better if I took it more seriously e.g. 4 hours a week and did proper compound lifts with free-weights.

But, I’m not going to lie, the free-weight section intimidates me a bit. I was thinking I could ask a PT to do a few sessions with me to ‘ease me in’. But wouldn’t want to (read: can’t afford) to continue. Would they do this? And even worth it in your opinion? Could help psychologically, but also in terms of doing the actual exercises properly. Or should I just stop being a p__sy?

Bonus question: any super simple compound lift guide? I’ve heard of the 5x5. I want to focus on (mainly) upper body. Would this work?

My current routine is chest+back/rest/arms+legs+shoulders/rest/repeat. 

Do higher volume and I like to do one drop set per muscle group at the end of every workout, I like the pump and the burn and the control with the lower weight at the end..... 

 My chest and back day consists of 4 compound movements each, 4x pushing 4xpulling. At the last exercise of chest and back I strip the weight off and do drop sets. So the volume and the stress on the muscle is fairly high. Then 48 hours later when I train arms, I have two exercises for bicep and two for tricep, on the second exercise, again, I do drop sets. 

That means arms are getting hit with pretty high volume every other day. 

I like that routine, but sometimes I think if I would just do push/pull, each arm muscle would have 4 days of rest, vs 48 hours, getting hit directly and indirectly all the time.

There are so many safety studies when it comes to protwin powder and many people take this supplement without having such terrible side effect, yet the doctors think it is because of the protein...

Every comment would be welcome."

1,"Hey!

Since quarantine/lockdown keeps getting extended I'm finally deciding on getting some adjustable dumbells for bulking up! I currently have a bench with a 7kg barbell and some light plates, but it's all outside in my open garage and we've just had our first snowy weather come through. This has resulted in the weather being below at least -1 degrees Celcius which is simply too cold for me to even bother working out. The stuff is also some old rusty stuff from my dad's past job that we picked up.

I'm severely underweight, (18 years old, 183cm/46kg), and I don't have space for a squat rack inside our home. Therefore I thought, that a pair of adjustable dumbells would be good enough for a 6-day ppl routine while staying at home. Is that true?

I live in Denmark/Europe and I'm willing to pay whatever price for them as long as they are the best I can get. I don't care about the cost as long as they are able to get me from my current weight and up +10kg at least if lockdown keeps going for long enough! I've already trained 1 year before but an eating disorder hit me and I lost from 64kg (March 2020, lockdown start) to my current weight of 46kg (This date).

I also have a bench that is kinda old, but it goes from decline to 90 degrees with a removable lock mechanism.

TLDR: Best adjustable dumbells on the market for whatever price? (Not crazy expensive like 2000$+ diamond dumbells, but you all know what I mean, Ahah xD)",Best adjustable dumbells for quarantine/lockdown?,"Best adjustable dumbells for quarantine/lockdown? Hey!

Currently i’m 6’3” at ~182 lbs. Not sure on my bodyfat %. 

With quarantine round 2 happening its given me time to reassess where i’m at and I figure it’s a good time to plot my plan for when gyms reopen to stop fucking around since this time off from the gym has made me reflect on my gainit goals and given me all the motivation to grind hard for it when they reopen.

I’ve just been spending quarantine eating at a maintenance calorie wise with high protein to try and preserve the bit of muscle I have built over the years while doing some resistance band stuff. But when I can get back into my gym and have access to actual decent gym equipment (which should be soon), i’d love some advice on any routines you can recommend and any other advice for gaining hypertrophy. 

My focus for the next year at least is to try and put on some serious size and I definitely am focused on hypertrophy since my goal is primarily (and pretty much exclusively) aesthetics. Prior to this most recent lockdown in my area I had 4 months of gym time and I was doing a 4 day split made for me by an online trainer and I was making some decent progress on that. Just trying to debate whether I continue on that once my gym reopens or if I should switch to a program that any of you with similar goals to me have had great success with. 

I find I tend to get a bit of analysis paralysis when it comes to routines and customizing them to my goals or areas where i'm lacking so I could definitely use some advice there. Also, how long should someone stay on a specific routine for? Sometimes I see people say no longer than 12 weeks, othertimes it's when you stop progressing. See, there's my analysis paralysis again lol. Am I overthinking things?

I have been making shakes which consist of Whey, Oats, Peanut Butter, Hemp Hearts, Chia Seeds, Mix Berries, Oil, Egg whites, Banana. Easy 1000 calorie shake right there., 

Is there any downside to drinking your calories, VS Eating them? The shakes all  have real food ingredients.

1,"Hi,

So, I've been bulking since the start of the year and I've gone from 152 lbs to 156 lbs over the past month. Over the past week my lifts haven't been going up. Rather than feeling fresh, I feel tired and sore when going into a workout.

Currently, I am eating between 2600-2800 cals a day. I am 25 years old, 156 lb and 6'2. At 152 lbs I was 7.1 % bf, but I don't know about now. I eat over 200 grams of protein a day.

I've been gaining on my current calories, just because I only get any exercise when I go to the gym. Otherwise, I am sitting down from the moment I wake-up.

My workout routine is a modified version of the 6-day reddit PPL.

**Push day (A/B):**

4x5-8 Bench press/OHP

3x8-12 OHP/BP

3x8-12 Incline

3x8-12 DB press

3x8 Skullcrushers ss w/ lat raises

3x8-12 tricep extension machine ss w/ lat raises

**Pull Day:**

3x8-12 Pullups 

4x5-10 Pendlay row 

3x8-12 Wide pulldowns

3x8-12 Chest supported row

4x8-12 Face Pulls ss w/ barbell curls

4x8-12 DB preacher curls

**Leg day:**

70 Bw squats

4x8-12 BB Squats

4x8-12 Stiff legged Deadlifts

3x8-12 burpees as high as possible

&amp;#x200B;

Every other day I hit abs, with 3xmax leg raises followed by 4x8-12 cable crunches.

Right now I can do bench for 125x7, squats for 135x12, deadlifts for 205x12

**Is that too much volume, or are my calories just too low? I am confused, because I've been gaining weight and I can see a physical difference, but my lifts have not been progressing. My cals seem rather low, when I compare my calories to other's bulking cals.**

I'd prefer to keep up with the volume, because I really look forward to going to the gym. The only thing that is sucky is that I am not progressing in the weights I've been doing, and I am sore before starting a workout.

1,"First of all i would like to thank everyone thats gonna read this. Its a huge help for me and i dont take it for granted in the slightest.  I will list my shit, and at the bottom i will write a couple of questions. Also i tried to format it nice, so u can read it better. I hope this helps.

Okay so im **6'5""** and i started to really eat way more like 3 months ago. Since then ive gained like 10 pounds, so now im at **175lbs**. I believe these are called noob gains tho. 


**My diet:**


My Tdee should be somewhere around 3000 and i pretty much eat somewhere around 4000kcal every single day.

These consists of:

600 oat cereals


700 pbj


600 for a snack (burritos, walnuts, or egg sandwiches)


700 for dinner (most of the time i eat rice or pasta with some extra shit like beans or turkey and some vegetables)


1200 shake with oats, banana, ice cream, milk, chia seeds and olive oil



I think this is considered a dirty bulk. 



**My workout:**

Its kinda scuffed i think. Due to lockdown i train at home, but i train 6 days of the week. I am doing low intensity and high rep workouts, as i only have 2 dumbbells, each with 22pounds. My routine is to start Monday with workout A, then B, then A, then B, then A, then B, then rest.





**Workout A:**

4x 25 pushups


4x 15 bicep curls


4x 15 dumbbell benchpress on the ground (22lbs each)


4x 6 shoulder dumbbell shoulder raises (22lbs each)


4x 15 dumbbell rows (22lbs each)


4x 15 weighted bench dips (44lbs on thighs)


**Workout B:**

4x 15 weighted squads (22lbs on each shoulder)


4x 15 sumo deadlifts (44lbs)


4x 15 romanian deadlifts (44lbs)


4x 15 (per leg) weighted bulgarian split squads, (22lbs)


4x 15 lying hamstring curls (22lbs)



On all days im doing 3 kinds of planks 3 times for 30 seconds






**So my questions are:**

1. how good is my diet, and do i have to eat more after gaining some weight?
2. how is my workout, and how far will low weights get me?
3. is gaining around 15pounds in the next 6 months a realistic goal?

1,"Hey all, 

Been lifting hard for 7 months since July 1st. June of '19 to July of '20 was basically just cutting and running to lose weight. 

Dropped to 189lb, and was ready to physically start packing on muscle. So I ate at 500cal surplus, dropped to a 250kcal surplus, then went back, when I realized that ""hey... I need to eat more food"".

At a 3,250kcal intake right now. Usually get slighty above that, just make sure to never be below it. 

Strength gains definitely saw an increase after the increase food. 

My 1RMs are currently:

Bench: 215lb - Definitely my weakest lift. I have a training weight of 160lb for 4x8. I could definitely be doing better, but it's my first year lifting so whatever. 

Squat: 280lb - This is just a guess, since my training weight is 245lb for 5x5. I don't generally lift for strength, just hypertrophy. This and DL are there to make me stronger. I'm scared to try a 1RM for squat. Which is silly, because I have my safety rails right there.

EDIT: 1RMed the other day at 335. Super happy.

Dead Lift: 425lb - This, while not as amazing as it could be, is my strongest lift. I definitely had more progress on DL than anything else, and I love doing it. Currently, my training weight is 365lb for 3x5, and my 425lb was a very wobbly lift, but I got it up. Started using a belt recently. Made a huge difference.

As the title says my 14YO started lifting in our home gym recently. We are all for it, it's great.

However I'm a bit concerned with his repeated requests for different supplements. First it started with protein powder which we had no problem with, then witamins, fish oil - which was fine as well. EDIT - the supplements I mentioned above I'm totally fine with. Those below worry me a bit. 

However now he's asking for creatine and caffeine because he 'needs energy when doing his morning workout'. For the time being we said no to that. He claims that he's done all the research, however I wanted a second opinion.

On top of that there's a niggling thought in the back of my mind saying: 'he's trying to solve every problem he has with a supplement'.

Are we just being overprotective or is this a legit concern.

I recently maxed my deadlift at 425lb and my bench at 215lb.

Until today, I have been primary lifting for hypertrophy. However, I have one month left until I start my cut. 8 months of bulking is enough for now.

I would like to hit that extra 25lb between now and the end of the month, which means focusing my lifts and eating on strength gains.

I've been trying to find ways to consume more of my calorie carb split (I do 35 prot 35 fat 30 carb) as complex/low GI carbs, since I find that the simple stuff (maltodextrin-heavy mass gainer shakes) makes me really lethargic when I consume it in high doses (plus I'm prone to prediabetes so I wanna avoid that y'know). Issue is, all the complex carbs I try to consume in the same amount as the simple ones are just so fucking tiring to eat. Like a solid hour of eating oats, or lentils, or brown rice, like jesus christ it's so slow. I think the fibre just makes it so time consuming to eat, and yeah it might be more healthy but fuck. Also it fills me up which makes eating more hard since I have GERD/acid reflux. lol.

Also, I don't wanna be eating like 400% of my daily fibre and having rock solid shits every few hours.

1,"Disclaimer:  Even though my opinion doesn't matter, I am going to give it to you anyway.  I'm not some record breaker or an overly successful entrepreneur.  I'm just some dude next door that lifts.

Are you a goal-oriented lifter?  Sure you are, you plan your training in advance and probably have a specific way to make sure you're recovering enough e.g. calories, macros, sleep.  The first thing we should ask ourselves in the gym is why are we doing this?  If it does not serve a specific purpose then discard it, Jim Wendler taught me that, but he also taught me AMRAPs, but what purpose do they serve?

AMRAPs serve 2 purposes that I can think of: To do the exercise to complete exhaustion and to measure a repetition max.  I will be focusing on the first one, as going for a rep PR is testing, and training is different than demonstrating. I spent a solid year testing my lifts all of the time and seeing what I could put up instead of lifting what I KNOW I could put up.  This resulted in negative progress and it's a lesson you don't have to learn the hard way, I already did that for you.  

So we are taking a movement to at least technical failure, which is usually done on the last set of an exercise., but how often are you doing that?  Every week?  Every workout? At the end of every exercise?    There are clear benefits we get from training to failure, but you should ask yourself if the pros outweigh the cons.  You will benefit similarly by training close to failure, but it won't cost you as much.  Say you AMRAP the last set of your first exercise in the gym, what do you think that costs?  What did it cost today?  What about the rest of the week?  How many sets or reps did you lose because of it, and likely more importantly, how badly did the quality of the rest of your work suffer?  Well the answer can't be zero or nothing unless it was an isolation movement done at the end of a workout, but I will bring that up later. I want to focus on AMRAPs for compound lifts you do early in training.  If you AMRAP the last set of bench, what happens to your OHP next?  Some people think they're getting away with it, but everything costs something.  

I'd like to get back to goals, and I am an extreme believer in specific goals and specificity in general.  As I mentioned before, you likely have your training written down already, and you know exactly what exercises you will be doing with how many sets logged before you even touch a barbell.  Even if you are using rate of perceived exertion, you have a specific number of reps you want to hit beforehand.  To me, this is undervalued.  Knowing exactly what will be asked of you from the exercise before you approach it is huge; it mentally preps you and tells you the exact amount of effort you will need.  This leads to higher quality sets.  AMRAPs are aimless, you might have an idea of where you'll land, but it's not specific enough, and when things aren't specific enough, they can burden you psychologically. I'm not sure the best way to word it, but if you have trained using AMRAPs I'm sure you know what I mean.  Instead, train with intention, train on purpose, know exactly what you need to ask of yourself so you can do it with intent.  AMRAPs have an unsure element to them, and when you are unsure, then what exactly is your intent?  You are doing something unspecific, you simply cannot have intentions that are specific enough.  This leads to uncertainty.  Training with uncertainty introduces doubt, which is EXTREMELY self-destructive. Doubt is to the soul what pain is to the body.  Set a very specific target and hit it EVERYTIME.  Prescribing yourself reps and hitting all of those reps builds confidence, so you won't have a good reason to doubt yourself.  Your body can only do what your mind tells it to, so train that too.

There is a secret great goal setters have, they know exactly what they want, when they want it, and how they're going to get there.  Saying ""I  want to gain weight"" is good, but we can do better.  ""I want to gain 15lbs by June"", now THAT puts some iron sights on your m4.  Furthermore, you put more on the line with specificity, you know exactly how to approach it.  You can break it down by the month or even week to get more specific and this holds you more accountable more often, especially with a deadline.

Now is AMRAPing your last set of tricep pushdowns or lateral raises going to damage your recovery enough to matter?  Probably not, but I would still argue that having a more specific purpose in ALL of your training is more beneficial to you psychologically, which is definitely the most overlooked thing when it comes to training in general.  

AMRAPs are fine as a metric, as a way to find a repetition max when you are testing.  I do not think it should be a strength training staple though, I find it to be poor mental hygiene.",Should AMRAPs be a strength TRAINING staple?,"Should AMRAPs be a strength TRAINING staple?

1,"Greetings Once Again Gainers,

After another 5 day stretch of weird shifts at work with lots of downtime, I've been pouring through the archives over at Physical Culture Study (fantastic website) and read through every single article on weight gaining.  I wanted to pass on some of that knowledge to you in an easy to parse through topic here on the r/gainit.  I cannot personally vouch for any of these approaches, as I've not had the time to employ them, but they come from some of the best in the business and, if nothing else, can serve as a contrast from the now standard ""eat X amount of carbs, Y amount of protein and Z about of fats"" that many of you are failing to find success with.

I cannot personally vouch for any of these approaches, as I've not had the time to employ them, but they come from some of the best in the business and, if nothing else, can serve as a contrast from the now standard ""eat X amount of carbs, Y amount of protein and Z about of fats"" that many of you are failing to find success with.  

Without further ado...

Obviously, I know to gain weight and break the plateau, but I simply wonder if it's worth it at all. I am hovering at around 3300 calories to maintain.

I thought I could reach 80 but seems to me now insane with how much food I'd have to chuck to get there. So I suppose my legs have to wait a little more.

Now here is what I was thinking and need your advice on this. I'm thinking of doing a cut to re-adjust my calorie intake. Cut back to 70, 68kg. And slowly re-bulking from there.

I am 23M, height 190cm (6ft 3in), 52kg (115 pounds). My BMI is 14.3 which is severely underweight.

Since last week I have started to focus on my diet and I am keeping an account of calories consumed. I was able to consume 2500+ calories/day and my weight increased from 50kg to 52kg in 7 days.

I have gained this weight on a healthy vegan diet - bananas, rice, tofu, soy milk, nuts, veggies, and seeds. On an average per day, I'm consuming high carbs (simple and complex) in excess of 330g, around 60-80g protein intake, and 38g fiber, 40g fat and 99g of sugar. I take Vitamin B12, D3, Omega-3 DHA supplements daily. 

I have done minimal workout at home for 3 days which included squats, plank exercise (tried push-ups but could not do). I am mostly home these days doing desk job, so not much movement. But I go for a walk after dinner. 

My main goal is to reach a healthy BMI (68 kg) first and then increase my weight to the ideal: 80 kg. I do not want to turn all the food I'm consuming into body fat. Therefore, I would like to join the gym and channelize the protein intake into muscle growth. Since I'm quite skinny, I can see bones protruding from my joints and shoulder. Therefore, I am looking to have solid arms, shoulder and calf muscles, for now. Later on I can work on other parts of my body.

Greetings, guys

I can see that everyday some of you good folks make really impressive progress and every single one of you has been an inspiration of mine through this process. So, first of all THANK YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

Little backstory,

I used to be really obese, by obese I mean I was around 100kg of pure fat, no exercise, wasn't moving my body at all and spent my entire days in house playing video games as a teen.

Decided that I have to stop my negative habits if I didn't plan to die by 25 of heart disease or diabetes.

Have to admit that it was really tough process losing all of that weight, not that much physically as mentally challenging it was.

Days, weeks, months went by and eventually with all the hard work I lost that weight. I lost around 66lbs if I recall correctly.

And there came the new phase, the new ""SKINNY ME"".

Pretty much, the only thing about being skinny that I liked is that every clothing piece suited me pretty decent in comparison and the fact that I made it to goal that I set for myself.

Being skinny for some time actually brought up that feeling of being really weak, felt really low with libido too. Didn't feel that strong at all.

So, I decided to step up my game and gain some muscle. And, oh boy, I didn't even realize how hard it actually was. Like, the eating part is probably the hardest. Forcing your body to eat and shoving that food up your mouth is really the worst. Peanut butter is life savior in that case tho.

After few months of peanut butter and feeling sick I came to realization that I actually gained pretty decent amount of weight and when I think about it, now I feel really really strong in comparison when I was skinny.

Don't really like that part where I gained a bit of fat, but the fact that I feel a lot stronger and physically better is compensating in that case.

Overall, I'm pretty happy where I'm at right now.

Keep up the good work guys!

Decided that I have to stop my negative habits if I didn't plan to die by 25 of heart disease or diabetes.

Have to admit that it was really tough process losing all of that weight, not that much physically as mentally challenging it was.

Days, weeks, months went by and eventually with all the hard work I lost that weight. I lost around 66lbs if I recall correctly.

And there came the new phase, the new ""SKINNY ME"".

Pretty much, the only thing about being skinny that I liked is that every clothing piece suited me pretty decent in comparison and the fact that I made it to goal that I set for myself.

Being skinny for some time actually brought up that feeling of being really weak, felt really low with libido too. Didn't feel that strong at all.

So, I decided to step up my game and gain some muscle. And, oh boy, I didn't even realize how hard it actually was. Like, the eating part is probably the hardest. Forcing your body to eat and shoving that food up your mouth is really the worst. Peanut butter is life savior in that case tho.

After few months of peanut butter and feeling sick I came to realization that I actually gained pretty decent amount of weight and when I think about it, now I feel really really strong in comparison when I was skinny.

Don't really like that part where I gained a bit of fat, but the fact that I feel a lot stronger and physically better is compensating in that case.

Overall, I'm pretty happy where I'm at right now.

Keep up the good work guys!

Edit: Dayuuuuuum. Thanks for the award! Glad that you liked my post that much that you decided to give me the award. Thank you!"
1,"Thanks in advance for any advice or critique.

I'm 24M, currently 82.9kg as of this morning, 182cm tall. According to a FitTrack scale I own, I currently sit at 17.4% BF. I was I believe around mid 20s% when I first started losing fat. Recently I've been focusing on also building muscle in the last few months.

As of this coming weekend I am at the end of a 5 week cut, eating initially 2000, now down to 1900 cals a day, 180+g protein, under 50g of fat (usually well under), the rest carbs.

I'm very keen to bulk and get bigger. I don't want to come off a cut and instantly put all that fat back on, but I also want to maximise my muscle growth from the time, energy and effort I'm putting into my workout and diet routine.

People's opinions differ hugely on if I can bulk or not. Many say if you're above 15% BF, which I am, then you need to keep cutting. Some say cut, maintain, cut, maintain, until you're below 15%, then again, bulk. Others say a small, lean bulk over a long time can cause body recomposition.

My question is: In my situation, what would you do? Switch into a lean bulk? Keep cutting, and if so, until when?

1,"I am seeing a lot of submissions asking if they should do X if they only have very little weight. While this is not optimal (hate that word, especially for lifting), there are dozens of ways around this.

I usually train with light weights, because I get most of my programming from the 5/3/1 Forever book, and Jim has you base your numbers off of your training max, which is 85% of your 'actual' 1rm. So most of my strength work is around 55-85% of my real 1rm, so it's absurdly light given the rep scheme. This allows me to put a lot of focus into each set and do every rep with intention. I never have the ""let's just get this over with"" attitude, and you won't either if you do your work with intention. Move the bar with a purpose.

**Tempo**
This is my go to; my favorite dance move. I incorporate brief pauses or purposely slow down the eccentric to make the set more challenging. I also like to put a lot of force into the concentric, so if I were to put 20 more pounds on the bar it would still fly up. 

**Rest periods**
Cut them shorter. I was doing 10x5 squats a couple weeks ago and I decided I was going to rest only 30 seconds because it felt very light and I was on my game. I don't use this one as much, because resting let's me visualize the next set and helps me train on purpose. But it's effective and just another form of progressive overload.

**Increase Frequency**
Have you heard of easy strength by dan john? If you don't know who that is then go read about him, he has an old school approach to lifting and is incredibly wise. But easy strength is essentially picking 5 movements and doing them everyday. Ultra high frequency, low intensity and volume. It worked very well for me after I took a hiatus from lifting and returned. 

**Increase volume**
This is an easy fix to low intensity, but I always add a set before increasing reps because it's easier and ensures you're doing more quality work than if you just added a rep to each set. You don't want your 2nd-5th set suffering because you burned yourself out on the first set by jumping the reps too fast.

There are many more approaches to getting stronger/bigger with limited weights such as drop sets or rest:pause, but these are my go tos, and in this specific order. They are all forms of progressive overload, which a lot of beginners think is strictly adding weight to the bar.

Will post new photos after I finish this program.

# Back story

I've been skinny my whole life (still am, albeit better than before haha). I'm also in terrible shape (being skinny **does not** equal being fit...and fit I am not...I've gotten sore for days helping a friend move a few moving boxes). It's not that I have an eating disorder or anything, I eat really whatever I want whenever I want to. It's just that ""whenever I want"" seems to be naturally less than most. I don't think about food, I don't crave food...if anything, eating is kind of a nuisance for me. There are countless times I've worked an entire day and have completely forgotten to eat. My friends all ""hate me"" because I ""eat whatever I want"" but in all reality, they're just seeing me at at that moment and not seeing all the other times when I put absolutely zero emphasis on food or making an effort to eat it....I'm just generally not hungry, and when I am, I eat something (""something"" being the operative word, as I don't make an effort to eat either healthy or unhealthy...just ends up being food). I think that's probably my biggest issue (although I didn't know it until I began this whole thing). The reason for saying ""my biggest issue"" is that I've tried gaining muscle (unsuccessfully) a multitude of times throughout my life, all with little to no success. I just assumed I was one of those people who ""can't gain muscle"" and left it at that.

# Why I Began

With the whole pandemic going on, I've been seeing a lot of my face on conference calls and the like. I've had a minor issue with my smile (two teeth are a bit crooked). I figured what better time to get Invisalign than now...I'm not physically at work, when I go out I have to wear a mask, etc. Once I got my trays I thought ""well, what else can I change? I've got to wear these things for 8 months, maybe I can ""tie another goal"" into this one"". I landed on making one last attempt at gaining muscle, but figured I'd go all out (both in researching nutrition and the equipment I'd be using). I figured if after the pandemic is over I can have a nice straight smile and look better physically I could essentially treat the pandemic as my personal ""cocoon"" from which I could emerge a...well, I don't want to call myself a butterfly, but you get the gist yeah?

# Why P90X?

Because I was overwhelmed by all the ""at home lift routines"" and wanted something that I could just simply follow, immediately, and not wonder what to do next.  Also because, probably more importantly, as mentioned previously, I'm in terrible shape. I *wanted* to get straight into a lifting program, but deep down I was pretty damn sure I'd hurt myself almost immediately and that'd be the end of it. I wanted to start with ""Body Beast"" but I figured before starting a lifting regimen I should probably get myself into some sort of shape first. Let my nervous and muscular systems ""learn"" how to work together, learn movements, learn ""form"", etc. Not to mention building some cardiovascular endurance. I've read a LOT about P90X, and while it gets a bad rap from some, it still seemed like overall most people endorse it. Now that I've completed P90X I've moved onto Body Beast.

# Nutrition

I have no problem following a workout program, so I knew that wasn't the crux of my problem (I've followed them religiously in the past and gotten no results...and that lack of results caused me to abandon working out altogether as I relegated myself to the ""permanently skinny club""). I researched a ton and landed on doing a 40/30/30 split (protein/carbs/fat) on about 2300 calories a day. Given my aversion to giving food any amount of effort or time, I needed to make things as simple as possible. So I decided on simply eating the exact same thing, every day, with the exception of dinner (I did make sure that my dinner was always a meat, a starch and a fresh vegetable, but it gave me enough daily variation to have at least one thing different). Every single day my routine went (and is back to going):

* **6:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, quarter cup steel cut oats
* **7:30am** \- workout
* **8:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, 1 cup chocolate milk, 1 egg, 2 slices bread
* **12:00pm** \- 1/2 cup cottage cheese, homemade salad (romaine, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers), homemade tuna salad (on top of the salad, which consisted of tuna, hard boiled eggs, onions, mayonnaise)
* **2:00pm** \- homemade smoothie (1 cup mixed fruit \[strawberries, blueberries, raspberries\], orange juice, 1% milk, 3ozs mixed nuts \[cashews, walnuts, almonds, pecans, brazil nuts\])
* **5:30pm** \- dinner
* **8/9pm** \- 1 scoop casein protein powder

I ate (and am back to eating) that exact thing every single day. Some of my friends think it's crazy and that they could never do that...but as it turns out, my indifference to food actually helps me on this point. Because I don't really care what I'm eating, *I never care what I'm eating.* It makes no difference to me that it's the same thing, every day. If anything, it's easier, because I don't have to think about it. I ""meal prep"" on Sundays (cut/chop everything for a weeks worth of salads, make a weeks worth of tuna salad, pre-make my smoothies and freeze them in foodsaver bags). The only thing I make ""on the fly"" is my dinner each night.

**If you have a look at the graphs in the photo** I linked to in the beginning of the post, you'll see me immediately begin to lose weight after November 31st (which was the date I finished P90X and then stopped eating the above and working out regularly).

# Equipment

I wanted to put a fair amount of money into this, as yet another reason to keep me sticking with things (if I'm going to spend over $1,000 on something, it'll keep me motivated on days where said motivation might otherwise be lacking). I bought a Wyze scale, an adjustable weight bench, smoothie machine, 3 months worth of protein powder, BeachBody subscription, water bottle and two 71.5lb AtivaFit adjustable dumbells.

# How it Went

Well, personally, I'm happy with the outcome. I only missed 4 days of the workout program, but otherwise stuck with it ""as prescribed"". Some interesting and entirely unexpected things happened that I'm quite happy about. My skin looks a thousand times better...a few wrinkles have all but disappeared. I had a few areas of eczema on my leg and face as well, and they have **completely** vanished (and they've plagued me for years...I purchase hydrocortisone cream once every month or so...and it's literally gone without a trace now). To say ""I feel a thousand times better"" would be a massive understatement. My energy levels are through the roof, I sleep like a dead body, my relationship has benefited from it (wink wink)...it's, well, amazing.

# What Next

After the roughly month I took off (and the weight I unintentionally lost during that time) I decided to give ""Body Beast"" a shot, now having more confidence that I wouldn't injure myself almost immediately. I'd like to see if I can get to 180lbs and then cut some fat off...I'm noticing that while gaining muscle, my body fat percentage climbs right along with it so presumable if/when I can get to 180lbs, I'll have a fair amount of fat to shave off at that point.","[Progress] M/35/5'11"" - 136-&gt;157lbs - 3 Months of at Home Workouts","[Progress] M/35/5'11"" - 136-&gt;157lbs - 3 Months of at Home Workouts 3 month progress photo (before and after) - [https://i.imgur.com/5Lx1Nar.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5Lx1Nar.jpg) .

I don't think about food, I don't crave food...if anything, eating is kind of a nuisance for me. There are countless times I've worked an entire day and have completely forgotten to eat. My friends all ""hate me"" because I ""eat whatever I want"" but in all reality, they're just seeing me at at that moment and not seeing all the other times when I put absolutely zero emphasis on food or making an effort to eat it....I'm just generally not hungry, and when I am, I eat something (""something"" being the operative word, as I don't make an effort to eat either healthy or unhealthy...just ends up being food). I think that's probably my biggest issue (although I didn't know it until I began this whole thing). The reason for saying ""my biggest issue"" is that I've tried gaining muscle (unsuccessfully) a multitude of times throughout my life, all with little to no success. I just assumed I was one of those people who ""can't gain muscle"" and left it at that.

# Why I Began

With the whole pandemic going on, I've been seeing a lot of my face on conference calls and the like. I've had a minor issue with my smile (two teeth are a bit crooked). I figured what better time to get Invisalign than now...I'm not physically at work, when I go out I have to wear a mask, etc. Once I got my trays I thought ""well, what else can I change? I've got to wear these things for 8 months, maybe I can ""tie another goal"" into this one"". I landed on making one last attempt at gaining muscle, but figured I'd go all out (both in researching nutrition and the equipment I'd be using). I figured if after the pandemic is over I can have a nice straight smile and look better physically I could essentially treat the pandemic as my personal ""cocoon"" from which I could emerge a...well, I don't want to call myself a butterfly, but you get the gist yeah?

# Why P90X?

Because I was overwhelmed by all the ""at home lift routines"" and wanted something that I could just simply follow, immediately, and not wonder what to do next.  Also because, probably more importantly, as mentioned previously, I'm in terrible shape. I *wanted* to get straight into a lifting program, but deep down I was pretty damn sure I'd hurt myself almost immediately and that'd be the end of it. I wanted to start with ""Body Beast"" but I figured before starting a lifting regimen I should probably get myself into some sort of shape first. Let my nervous and muscular systems ""learn"" how to work together, learn movements, learn ""form"", etc. Not to mention building some cardiovascular endurance. I've read a LOT about P90X, and while it gets a bad rap from some, it still seemed like overall most people endorse it. Now that I've completed P90X I've moved onto Body Beast.

# Nutrition

I have no problem following a workout program, so I knew that wasn't the crux of my problem (I've followed them religiously in the past and gotten no results...and that lack of results caused me to abandon working out altogether as I relegated myself to the ""permanently skinny club""). I researched a ton and landed on doing a 40/30/30 split (protein/carbs/fat) on about 2300 calories a day. Given my aversion to giving food any amount of effort or time, I needed to make things as simple as possible. So I decided on simply eating the exact same thing, every day, with the exception of dinner (I did make sure that my dinner was always a meat, a starch and a fresh vegetable, but it gave me enough daily variation to have at least one thing different). Every single day my routine went (and is back to going):

* **6:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, quarter cup steel cut oats
* **7:30am** \- workout
* **8:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, 1 cup chocolate milk, 1 egg, 2 slices bread
* **12:00pm** \- 1/2 cup cottage cheese, homemade salad (romaine, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers), homemade tuna salad (on top of the salad, which consisted of tuna, hard boiled eggs, onions, mayonnaise)
* **2:00pm** \- homemade smoothie (1 cup mixed fruit \[strawberries, blueberries, raspberries\], orange juice, 1% milk, 3ozs mixed nuts \[cashews, walnuts, almonds, pecans, brazil nuts\])
* **5:30pm** \- dinner
* **8/9pm** \- 1 scoop casein protein powder

I ate (and am back to eating) that exact thing every single day. Some of my friends think it's crazy and that they could never do that...but as it turns out, my indifference to food actually helps me on this point. Because I don't really care what I'm eating, *I never care what I'm eating.* It makes no difference to me that it's the same thing, every day. If anything, it's easier, because I don't have to think about it. I ""meal prep"" on Sundays (cut/chop everything for a weeks worth of salads, make a weeks worth of tuna salad, pre-make my smoothies and freeze them in foodsaver bags). The only thing I make ""on the fly"" is my dinner each night.

**If you have a look at the graphs in the photo** I linked to in the beginning of the post, you'll see me immediately begin to lose weight after November 31st (which was the date I finished P90X and then stopped eating the above and working out regularly).

# Equipment

I wanted to put a fair amount of money into this, as yet another reason to keep me sticking with things (if I'm going to spend over $1,000 on something, it'll keep me motivated on days where said motivation might otherwise be lacking). I bought a Wyze scale, an adjustable weight bench, smoothie machine, 3 months worth of protein powder, BeachBody subscription, water bottle and two 71.5lb AtivaFit adjustable dumbells.

# How it Went

Well, personally, I'm happy with the outcome. I only missed 4 days of the workout program, but otherwise stuck with it ""as prescribed"". Some interesting and entirely unexpected things happened that I'm quite happy about. My skin looks a thousand times better...a few wrinkles have all but disappeared. I had a few areas of eczema on my leg and face as well, and they have **completely** vanished (and they've plagued me for years...I purchase hydrocortisone cream once every month or so...and it's literally gone without a trace now). To say ""I feel a thousand times better"" would be a massive understatement. My energy levels are through the roof, I sleep like a dead body, my relationship has benefited from it (wink wink)...it's, well, amazing.

# What Next

After the roughly month I took off (and the weight I unintentionally lost during that time) I decided to give ""Body Beast"" a shot, now having more confidence that I wouldn't injure myself almost immediately. I'd like to see if I can get to 180lbs and then cut some fat off...I'm noticing that while gaining muscle, my body fat percentage climbs right along with it so presumable if/when I can get to 180lbs, I'll have a fair amount of fat to shave off at that point."

Like most people here I wanted to fit into my clothes better and was getting tired of people commenting on how skinny I was. For the past year I've been running a PPL routine that i've put together with some basic research with one rest day per week. I work out in the morning monday-friday and eat right after I get back from the gym. I am trying to find a new routine focused on powerbuilding as I love trying to push Squat, Bench, and Deadlift while continuing to focus on hypertrophy. I started out in my apartments gym and once I felt I needed more resistance after a month I signed up for a gym membership around mid February and then Covid shut down the gym until June. During that time I just focused on doing light cardio work 3-4 times a week.

Food wise i am rough tracking calories by eating a shake in the morning that is just over 1k calories and then 3-4 small meals throughout the day after that consist of a mix of chicken and past egg and tortilla rollups, salmon/veggie burgers and protein oat peanut butter mix throughout the day. When I've tracked calories it comes out to 2800-3000 calories per day. I am planning on cutting around April, but right now I don't mind the excess belly fat.

1,"Hey everyone, sorry if this post gets a little long. 

So basically, I've been working out for about 5 years now, and I don't look it. I'm a PT student so I have a lot of knowledge, good nutrition, consistency, etc. but one major roadblock throughout the entirety of my training has been form. 

I can recognize good/bad form in others, but I am horrible about it when it comes to myself. I can't see myself from all angles, so it's hard to focus on when I'm actually in the gym, but sometimes when the gym is empty I will set up my phone as a camera to check. 

I did that the other day as I hit some DLs, and upon review my back curved A LOT (this explains my recent back pain). Now I'm upset because all the progress I thought I made (finally hit a 1rm of &gt;300) was made with sloppy form. Back to 135 again, I guess. This has happened several times. 

I have decided to do nightly stretches and exercises to strengthen my hip flexors, but one thing has been bugging me. I want to bulk, because after all these years I'm still 185 lbs at ~16% bf. But I can't bulk with bad form...and I cant drop weights and expect to put on muscle either. So...

Do I drop the weight on key lifts for now, and go heavy on isolation exercises where my form is better? Do I drop weights, and get lean while I focus on form? Or do I maintain until I have my form perfected? I'm at an impasse and tired of spinning my wheels. 

Any advice or encouragement is appreciated. Fitness is my passion but I'm still pretty bad at it.

Hey y'all, back with a 2nd year update. 30 lbs gain in 2 years, def not all muscle but super happy about my progress. Recap: I've struggled with being under weight and having a myriad of GI issues for my entire adult life. I had never weighed above 130 lbs. Only recently have my eating habits felt ""normal"" and holy moly what have I been missing the past 15 years of my life. For the first time \*ever\* I finally feel ... right/normal. I can actually eat a full plate without feeling or needing to throw up. I have enough energy to make it through the day. I don't have to fight off dozing off during work or while driving. I'm not sure exactly what clicked after 28 years, but I know I started consistently working out 2 year ago and other aspects of my health and especially my GI issues started improving drastically.

DIET:

I don't follow a diet plan other then eating somewhat healthy and eating a complete breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. Again, being able to eat more then a bowl of cereal in a day without feeling full is a new experience for me so I honestly just try and eat as much as I can.

ROUTINE:

1,"A couple of months ago I was 185 and I’m shocked to see that I’m currently 199 exactly (6’2). 

Because of life, there have been many days where I don’t even come close to my daily goal, but despite that I’m gaining at a good pace and I don’t really understand how or why.

On an ideal day I eat 3 meals and drink my shake that rounds out to about 990 calories with rarely any snacking throughout the day.

Mornings are usually 3-4 eggs, toast, with some variation of a side , then I make my shake which I drink throughout the next few hours. Lunch has typically been a double wrap burrito from chipotle at LEAST 3 times a week. It’s expensive but hopefully it’s paying off. Dinner is whatever my mom makes, which I appreciate since I’m busy with school. It’s honestly hard to keep track of my calories for things like homemade food not prepared by me, but I typically stuff myself with whatever food is there and hope for the best which you will probably flame me for, but it seems to be working so far. I also drink half a gallon of water throughout the day and that’s it.

As I’ve mentioned there are just days where I simply don’t get it done. It’s usually the weekends, where I have a time commitment from the very early morning to almost mid afternoon. I eat breakfast (Bacon Egg and Cheese + Coffee from Dunkin’) those days, and will probably eat a late lunch (Moes or Chipotle) after I’m done with my obligations. But by the time I get home on weekends (after legs on Saturday especially) I find myself having been too tired to go and make my shake/figure out dinner. I just shower and crash until the next day. Let’s assume I get 1600 calories on those weekend days from my two meals.

Sorry for rambling, but my main question revolves around whether or not the “calorie goal” is as strict as people make it seem. Is there supposed to be room for error? I figured when people stress the daily aspect, it’s for a reason.

On average I may have 4 great days of eating a week, one solid, and two where I know I didn’t eat enough. Despite that though, I’ve had gained steadily. 

Primary goal is muscle gain and I’m trying to bulk up on a PPL Split for 6 days a week thanks to recommendations from some of you guys. Started a few weeks ago.

1,"This topic comes up all the time, but evidently it needs to be repeated again:

**YOU MUST DO CARDIO.**

Cardio &amp; Conditioning Work is not optional, and it's not a suggestion. It's a MUST-DO. This is a non-negotiable.

- ""But I'm only trying to build muscle, I have no interest in building endurance""...

- ""I'm already a hard-gainer as it is. I don't want to burn the additional calories""...

- ""I just don't have time to do cardio, it's boring; I mean really, really boring"" etc.

Have you ever said any of these things? These are the most common excuses for skipping cardio &amp; conditioning.

Never mind the manifold health benefits for cardio. Never mind the fact it can help boost appetite significantly. 

Let's look at this instead through the lens of this metaphor: YOUR BODY IS AN ENGINE. (Well, *you* are the *vehicle,* and your muscles are the engine, rather). You are much like a finely-tuned machine that creates movement and work. And how does a motor accomplish this? It's the pistons firing up &amp; down that drive the transmission, which translates into rotation of the wheels. We all understand that the force of the internal combustion engine is what moves the car or truck along. Are you with me so far?

Well, how would you build a stronger engine, an engine with more torque or more horsepower? The fastest route is through a simple increase in DISPLACEMENT. (I say ""simple"", but it's anything but that. It requires a great deal of machining to do this. Honestly, it would be faster to just swap out engines altogether. But I digress). So what would that look like? You would bore out each of the cylinders to a larger diameter, and swap out the pistons with larger ones. In a nutshell, you would increase the total cubic inches of volume wherein the combustion happens. Does that make sense?

*More displacement equals more fuel/air mixture equals bigger boom equals more force.*

In a limited sense, this would be a way to achieve ""engine hypertrophy"". You make a bigger engine.

But in practice, can you do (only) this? Can you simply make your internal combustion chamber larger and have it work?

**NO.** No it's not enough to have a larger engine block. And why is this? Because there's a host of other mechanical mechanisms that also need to be in place to support an increase in displacement. You would also want to re-machine the valve openings and install larger valves (to let fuel in, and let exhaust out more rapidly). The engine would also require larger diameter intake &amp; exhaust manifolds. It would also likely require a higher-flow fuel pump. It would also overheat easier, which would necessitate a more robust cooling system (higher pressure &amp; higher volume of engine coolant) etc.

All these requirements are based on the fact that a larger combustion process requires more air to match the increase in gasoline which fuels the process. A larger engine also results in a higher volume of exhaust gases after the explosion. The combustion of a larger engine runs hotter, which means the cooling requirements are greater. The whole point of this allegory is YOU CAN'T SIMPLY MAKE A LARGER ENGINE. All the supporting systems will need to be upgraded too.

Again, this is just a metaphor. But the thrust of my post is thus: *If you build bigger muscles through lifting, you're also going to need to upgrade your supporting physiological processes!* So stop thinking of ""cardio"" as for ""endurance"" only. Instead, envision cardio as HELPING YOUR MUSCLES **BREATHE.** Your ability to lift a meaningful volume of challenging sets within a reasonable time depends on your muscles ability to get adequate fuel, to dispose of metabolic wastes efficiently, and to oxygenate all of the tissues that are involved in performing the lift itself.

Is resistance-training enough to improve your resistance training? No, it's not. Lifting in &amp; of itself doesn't burn a ton of calories, and it doesn't really ramp up mitochondrial activity. Supplemental cardio &amp; conditioning work will increase your total energy in the gym. It will make higher-rep sets easier to hit. It will help you be ready for the next set sooner. It will reduce muscle soreness in the days following each session. It will help get glycogen &amp; nutrients back into the muscle and tendon, to repair them faster and more efficiently. It will increase insulin sensitivity significantly etc. etc.

If you're bulking in a massing phase, you should be doing even *more* cardio than when you're cutting!

If you want to minimize fat accumulation on a bulk, you need to be doing more cardio &amp; conditioning!

If you're having difficulty recovering, but you're eating &amp; sleeping enough, you likely need more cardio!

Cardio/Conditioning can be as simple as adding a couple of brisk walks every single day. Two 10-minute walks are quick, easy, require no special equipment, and can be done right outside your front door. You don't need to suit up, drive to the gym, and sweat out on a stairclimber for an hour (unless you enjoy that!). Simply add brisk walks a couple times per day, every day. If you ever feel drowsy after a big meal, go for a walk. It tends to energize you, and pick you right back up.

Another favorite of mine is skipping rope. For a small investment ($12-15 bucks), you can get a jump rope and skip for 5-10 minutes per day (this is in addition to the brisk walking). I like intervals (skip for 20 seconds, pause for 10 seconds, repeat). Or shoot for a total number (100 skips, 500 skips, whatever). Just get better at it, and build up volume over time. A little bit every day, every other day, adds nothing to your allostatic load. It's not really fatiguing whatsoever.

What else can be done with little/no equipment? HILL SPRINTS. (Find a hill, run up it, walk back down, sprint back up. Repeat a few times). The goal with the heavier conditioning like this is to get winded; you *want* to get out of breathe, and continue to keep pushing into it. If you have a backpack, you can fill it with books and/or a couple dumbbells, and walk with that for distance, hopefully uphill! Wrap those weights in a blanket or pillow, and walk for 30-45 minutes. A canvas bag can also be purchased for little cost, and filled with sandbags. This can be used for front carries etc.

Look, I know cardio is additional work. But if you want to make the most of a bulking phase, ADD CARDIO.

Just move more every day, and make a point of getting winded/gassed/totally-out-of-breath a couple times per week.

Your total energy will go up, your focus &amp; attention will improve, your gym aggression and recovery will increase.

There's like 20 different reasons to add cardio/conditioning work, but I can't think of a single reason NOT to.

1,"So I've just reached the 1 year progress point and thought I'd post on reddit which has been my main place for motivation and advice. I haven't made major progress but I'm happy with where I'm at.

I haven't been to the gym once since I started my fitness journey. At the start I just wanted to do some home workouts with dumbbells and build a foundation to then go to the gym, but then the pandemic came. Because of this I have never done any barbell lifts and I haven't attempted a pull up ever. I can't get a pull up bar as I am too afraid of damaging the door frames in my rented apartment.

[https://imgur.com/a/H6seKZz](https://imgur.com/a/H6seKZz) \- **0,4,8,10,12 Month Progress**

# Training

I started out with a dumbbell full body workout that I found on Simeon Panda's YouTube that had some basic exercises that consisted of:

* **Pushups, Bent Over Rows, Bicep Curls, Tricep Kickbacks, Overhead Press, Squats, Stiff-Legged Deadlift, Leg Raises**

In the beginning I couldn't do one push up and used very light weights, doing 2 sets of 8-12 reps. After a month or two I started doing 3 sets. I would do this workout whenever I felt like it, sometimes everyday for a week and other times just once or twice a week.

After a few months of that I progressed into a PPL dumbbell split that I've been doing ever since. My dumbbells only go up to 45lbs so I can't do anything crazy.

Dumbbell PPL Routine:

Day 1 -

***Chest, Shoulders &amp; Triceps***

* **Pushups / Floor Press - 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Flys - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Overhead Press - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Side Raise - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Diamond Push Ups - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Tricep Kickbacks / Skullcrushers - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**

Day 2 -

***Back &amp; Biceps***

* **Dumbbell Bent Over Row - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **One Arm Dumbbell Row - 5 Sets, 8-12e. Reps**
* **Dumbbell Bicep Curl - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Hammer Curl - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Pinwheel Curl - 2 Sets, 8-12 Reps**

* **Dumbbell Calf Raise - 3 Sets, 20-25 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Goblet Squats - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**

Day 4 -

***REST DAY***

I do a version of that ab workout every day or two with some variations now and then. Admittedly I've skipped a lot of leg days, they are just not as enjoyable as the upper body days. Maybe once I get under the squat rack I'll enjoy them more.

Now I can do around 15-20 pushups in one set and feel much more comfortable doing them. I add weight to the dumbbells each week to try and make progress but it's hard since I only have a limited amount of weight to add.

# Diet

When I started working out I had just started learning how to cook so I was having 3 meals everyday and probably getting around 2500 calories in most days. I bought a mass gainer powder that I'd have 3 scoops of with 700-800ml of milk after a workout.

As for my diet right now, I try to get in 3000-4000 calories. I succeed most days but its not always the cleanest food. I usually get between 120-180g of protein. For breakfast I have 3 Weetabix with chocolate soya milk, a banana and a glass of fruit juice every morning, around 700kcal. My lunches vary. I was making a green smoothie with fruit juice, an avocado, spinach and peanut butter that was around 700kcal but it was too expensive so I've stopped making it. I'll usually have a sandwich and a couple clementine's or Baked beans on toast, lets say 500kcal. Dinner is usually around 800-900kcal, my go to meals are Tuna pasta, Chicken fried rice with chicken breast and 2 eggs, Beef burgers, Chicken breast with a sauce, rice and broccoli, etc. About 30 minutes to an hour after my dinner I'll have a protein smoothie that's around 700-800kcal. 400ml milk, 1 banana, 1 or 2 tbsp. of peanut butter, 1tsp. Nutella, 1 scoop whey protein. Around 10 or 11pm I'll have something else to eat, usually another sandwich or a couple pb&amp;j sandwiches. That's about all I eat + some other snacks and unhealthy foods in-between. I'm going to start having a glass of whole milk with my lunch and later meal to get some more calories in. I definitely have more space to eat as I have a big appetite it's just I don't really enjoy eating and don't know what to eat without being super unhealthy.

I don't take any supplements or creatine, except protein powder.

Hopefully the world returns to normal soon and I can make some real gains in the gym. I'm pleased with the progress I've made though and hope to continue gaining weight this year.

Advice and tips on what I could change and improve on are appreciated. Also feel free to post your favorite meals for lunch and dinner to give me some more ideas on what to have.

That's about all I eat + some other snacks and unhealthy foods in-between. I'm going to start having a glass of whole milk with my lunch and later meal to get some more calories in. I definitely have more space to eat as I have a big appetite it's just I don't really enjoy eating and don't know what to eat without being super unhealthy.

I don't take any supplements or creatine, except protein powder.

Hopefully the world returns to normal soon and I can make some real gains in the gym. I'm pleased with the progress I've made though and hope to continue gaining weight this year.

Advice and tips on what I could change and improve on are appreciated. Also feel free to post your favorite meals for lunch and dinner to give me some more ideas on what to have. Thanks for reading."

1,"Hello,

I (18M 5’10.5” 148lb) have been currently trying to bulk since mid-late December. My routine is usually as follows:

Monday: Pull day

Tuesday: HIIT workout

Wednesday : Leg day

Thursday: Running if possible

Friday: Push day

Saturday: HIIT workout 

Sunday: Indoor cycle if possible 

(On my running days, I do interval sprints for 45 minutes-1 hour or so. On cycle days, it’s about the same. On HIIT workouts, it’s usually a 35 or 40 minute workout from Fitness Blender.)

My main question is: am I doing too much cardio that ruins my muscle growth? I go as hard as possible on lifting days, so that’s not a problem. However, (especially with running), I feel that I do too much cardio and it’s ruining my gains. I also try to eat more calories than I burn and usually eat chicken, pasta, steak, fish, and other high-protein foods in my meals, as well as a protein bar, frozen fruit protein shake, a banana, a mandarin, and a spinach salad with eggs, bacon, and eggs everyday.

1,"Greetings Once Again Gainers,

Like many of you gainers, I work an office job in front of a computer at a desk that has minimal physical demand and lots of sitting.  This allows for unique opportunities for gaining, IF one is willing to take a few unique actions in order to maximize the potential contained within.  I wanted to share some tips I’ve picked up along the way so that you can make the most of your situation.  This should work for those of you that are stuck in an office OR for those of you that are full time students, but even those of you with less sedentary lifestyles may be able to pick something up from it.

---

**THINGS TO BUY** 

* INSULATED LUNCHBOX.  Having a way to bring food to the office is key to ensuring you have food to eat.  You don’t want to eat out for every meal, as it’s costly and you have minimal control over food quality.  You also run the risk of losing your parking space if you leave for lunch.  AND, if you bring food, you don’t run the risk of working through lunch, which is typical for you workaholics.  My wife bought me [this one]( https://www.amazon.com/Performa-Punisher-MealPrep-Bag-Accommodate/dp/B077GRQFQN/ref=sr_1_35?dchild=1&amp;keywords=punisher+insulated+lunch+box&amp;qid=1611162229&amp;sr=8-35) for my birthday, and it’s really awesome, but you can get something simple.  The other benefit of having your own lunchbox is you can keep your food in it and next to you vs using the office communal fridge, which prevents food thieves from eating your lunch and leaving you hungry.  And, of course, I keep writing “lunch”, but in truth, I pack a LOT of food for work.  I literally eat something every hour that I’m at work, and that lunchbox goes a long way to ensure that I have enough food to get me through my shift.

* STAINLESS STEEL WATER BOTTLE.  I like a [half gallon size]( https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Bottle-AOZEX-Insulated-Leakproof/dp/B085S6M2TR/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3QOFYWV32ZGIW&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=stainless+steel+half+gallon+water+bottle&amp;qid=1611162464&amp;sprefix=stainless+steel+half+gall%2Caps%2C179&amp;sr=8-8) like that one.  If you’re gaining, you’re eating a lot of protein.  Protein, as a macronutrient, requires more water for digestion than any other macronutrient.  It’s why most “survival food” has minimal protein in it and much more fats and carbs.  But you don’t run the risk of dying of dehydration in an office IF you’re keeping hydrated.  The other perk about drinking a lot of water while working is that it will force you to get up more frequently so that you can go use the bathroom, which can prevent the maladies associated with remaining in a seated position for so long.  I aim to fill and drink this 3 times in a shift, getting in 6 liters of water a day.  Oh yeah, and steel tends to have less toxins associated with it compared to drinking from plastic bottles, and this is environmentally friendly compared to junking a bunch of single use plastic bottles, so that’s cool too.

* GLASS FOOD CONTAINERS. [This]( https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Storage-Containers-Piece-Proof/dp/B082SN4QH6/ref=sr_1_4?crid=X03R665LMPQ6&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=glass+storage+containers&amp;qid=1611162677&amp;sprefix=glass%2Caps%2C196&amp;sr=8-4) is the set I have, but there are a ton out there.  That lunchbox I linked came with containers, and I still use them for veggies and sandwiches, but when it comes to food that needs reheating or has sauces/staining elements to it, glass is the way to go. Zapping plastic in the microwave never sits well with me, and if you put something with pasta sauce in a plastic container the stain never gets out.  I also find that food tends to stay fresher in glass containers, which is great if you make things in bulk and eat them throughout the week.  I’ve had leftover last MUCH longer once I switched from tupperwear to glass containers. 

* GRIPPERS.  [Captains of Crush are King]( https://www.amazon.com/IronMind-Captains-Crush-Hand-Gripper/dp/B0094WEFJM/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=captains+of+crush+grippers&amp;qid=1611165376&amp;sr=8-4), but I have heard good things about heavy grippers as well.  These are great toys to have at the office whenever you have some downtime and wanna get in some sort of training.  People tend to neglect their grip a lot in their training, and these dudes will right fix that.  Make no mistake: these aren’t sporting goods store grippers that you’re going to mindlessly click for a million reps: this is a real workout.  

* PLASTIC OR BAMBOO SILVERARE.  If you’re fortunate enough to have your own desk, make sure it has a lot of ready to go silverware in it.  Nothing is worse than packing a whole bunch of food for work and then finding out you have no way of eating it because you forgot to pack THAT.  Consequently, I picked up some [bamboo silverware]( https://www.amazon.com/Bamboo-Utensils-Cutlery-Set-BEWBOW/dp/B07MGVXFWJ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&amp;keywords=bamboo+silverware&amp;qid=1611162990&amp;sr=8-9) that is attached to my lunchbox now so that I know I’ll never be without.  Also great when there are surprise office birthdays, because people always remember the cake and always forget the forks.

* SLOW COOKER/INSTANT POT.  I’ve written about all this already in my post on [bachelor bulking]( https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ijjm9h/bachelor_bulking_quit_making_shakes_learn_how_to/), but seriously, get some sort of way to make a lot of food with little effort, put it in the BIG glass container, then transition it to the little glass containers and put that in your lunchbox for the day.

**THINGS TO DO** (workouts before work, full sessions, conditioning sessions, tabata)
* WORKOUT BEFORE WORK.  One of the best things you, as a gainer, can do is to workout BEFORE you get to work.  Why?  Because training makes you hungry, and if you’re struggling to gain, increasing appetite before you get to work is a GOOD thing.  Sure, it also helps make you awake and is good for health and all that, but we’re talking about gaining here.  You can either do a full on lifting workout, a 10-20 minute conditioning workout, OR you could even do a simple short Tabata style workout.

If you’re unfamiliar with what Tabata is: [here]( https://www.t-nation.com/training/tabata-method) is a great article on it by Dan John.  Yeah, it talks about fat loss, but since we’re using it to TRIGGER appetite and THEN eat, it works well for our purposes.  Burpees are a great movement to use this on, as they require no equipment and you can knock it out stupidly quick.  If you have MORE than 4 minutes, look for some Crossfit WODs or just do a simple circuit workout.  You could do something like 5 burpees-10 push ups-20 squats for as many rounds as possible in 10-20 minutes.  Either way, get in the training BEFORE work and then spend the entire time you’re there eating out of that lunch box.  And speaking of eating…

*OFFICE DRONE SNACKS**
These are the foods you should have at your desk, ready to go at a moment’s notice to get your gain on.

* PROTEIN BARS.  I’m a big fan of [Quest](https://www.questnutrition.com/collections/protein-bars), but there are tons of great brands out there.  Costco sells a knock off of Quest that is quite good and cheap, and I buy a lot of those as well.  These are perfect to keep at the desk or in a backpack/pocket for when you need to get on a protein fix.

* NUTS.  I’m not going to link you to nuts: you can figure that out.  But nuts have just TONS of positive qualities associated with them due to their healtful fats, and they are very calorie dense.  Have a jar at your desk.

* DRIED FRUIT.  Raisins, prunes, dates, figs, whatever.  These things don’t spoil and are packed with calories, along with nutrients.  Another fantastic snack.

* NUT BUTTERS.  Peanut butter, almond, cashew, etc.  This, combined with your plastic or bamboo spoon, is absolute money for a quick and easy snack.  I’m actually really into the brand [Nuts N More]( https://nuts-n-more.com/collections/online-store), which is a peanut/almond butter mixed with a protein powder for a slightly better macro breakdown, but as long as you stick with the natural stuff that requires stirring you should be just fine.

* INSTANT OATMEAL.  I like [this brand]( https://www.betteroats.com/), because it coming with it’s own measuring pouch is pretty cool, but again, there are a lot of choices out there.  Instant oatmeal is a real treat on a cold day, and you can use your office microwave or coffee maker to get some hot water to make this quick. 

* POP TARTS.  Man I love pop tarts.  That said, you probably shouldn’t eat them.  …but man I love pop tarts.

You could do something like 5 burpees-10 push ups-20 squats for as many rounds as possible in 10-20 minutes.  Either way, get in the training BEFORE work and then spend the entire time you’re there eating out of that lunch box.  And speaking of eating…

*OFFICE DRONE SNACKS**
These are the foods you should have at your desk, ready to go at a moment’s notice to get your gain on.

* PROTEIN BARS.  I’m a big fan of [Quest](https://www.questnutrition.com/collections/protein-bars), but there are tons of great brands out there.  Costco sells a knock off of Quest that is quite good and cheap, and I buy a lot of those as well.  These are perfect to keep at the desk or in a backpack/pocket for when you need to get on a protein fix.

* NUTS.  I’m not going to link you to nuts: you can figure that out.  But nuts have just TONS of positive qualities associated with them due to their healtful fats, and they are very calorie dense.  Have a jar at your desk.

* DRIED FRUIT.  Raisins, prunes, dates, figs, whatever.  These things don’t spoil and are packed with calories, along with nutrients.  Another fantastic snack.

* NUT BUTTERS.  Peanut butter, almond, cashew, etc.  This, combined with your plastic or bamboo spoon, is absolute money for a quick and easy snack.  I’m actually really into the brand [Nuts N More]( https://nuts-n-more.com/collections/online-store), which is a peanut/almond butter mixed with a protein powder for a slightly better macro breakdown, but as long as you stick with the natural stuff that requires stirring you should be just fine.

* INSTANT OATMEAL.  I like [this brand]( https://www.betteroats.com/), because it coming with it’s own measuring pouch is pretty cool, but again, there are a lot of choices out there.  Instant oatmeal is a real treat on a cold day, and you can use your office microwave or coffee maker to get some hot water to make this quick. 

* POP TARTS.  Man I love pop tarts.  That said, you probably shouldn’t eat them.  …but man I love pop tarts.

Since August 2019, my 5 rep exercises have gone from:

1 set, 5 reps:
Deadlift: 150lbs, 305lbs

Everything else is 5x5:

Squat: 135lbs, 270lbs

Bench press: 95lbs, 165 lbs

Overhead press: 55lbs, 115lbs

Barbell row: 85lbs, 165lbs

Keep in mind these second numbers are just what I’m currently progressing through on PPL (through the Clank app), not like an official max or anything. 

I just don’t know where to go from here. I want to be, you know, jacked, but don’t know if I get there through bulking (I’ve pretty much been on a bulk since I started), or cutting then bulking again. I included pics where I’m flexing but also just passive to show how far my stomach can extend. I’m 180lbs, 5’8”, 18 y/o. From the front, my arms seem kind of lacking but then in other pictures they look okay. Don’t really know where to go to get where I wanna be, through switching programs, cutting or bulking, etc. Been eating 3500 cals almost everyday, definitely getting enough protein.

Also how’s my progress in general? Could it have been better? Thanks.",125 to 180 lbs in 1 year 5 months Weight Gain Progress Post,"125 to 180 lbs in 1 year 5 months Weight Gain Progress Post https://imgur.com/a/NcJKc2N

#2.1. Training  (part 1 June 2019 - August 2020)

So when I first started working out, I didn't know anything about how to exercise. At the very beginning I couldn't even do a normal push up I was so weak. I didn't even know pull ups were a thing or the fact you had to actually train your back. I didn't start working to get jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. And the only exercises I knew were push ups, sit ups and squats. I didn't have any equipments, neither did I have time or money to go to a gym. I first started with an app called 30 Day Home Workout Challenge or something like that. It had different variations of push ups and sit ups. It took me about 3 months to build up to 10 normal push ups. During this time I was watching a lot of YouTube videos about bodyweight workouts and fitness in general. I didn't have a pull up bar. So I did my pull ups first on a door ledge and then on a collapsible gate with towels wrapped around it otherwise my hands would bleed. The first time I did negative pull ups, after mere 3 reps I had incredible pain in my elbows that lasted almost a whole week. I could neither fully straighten or bend my arms. However I kept going and slowly, very slowly got better until I could do it for some reps without pain.

I had also stopped using that app and was trying things myself. However I didn't know what I was doing. I thought I knew everything from watching YouTube videos but clearly that was not the case. I was following AthleanX and was doing 17 different curl variations with my 25lbs red resistance tube. Most of my exercises were of the same intensity (didn't change the progressions to make it harder) and I always did everything to failure. Was trying out different things like density training, drop set everything, mechanical drop set everything and what not. I was the perfect example of doing fuckaroundities.

Around last year March it slowly occurred to me that I was not moving forward. There was no progress. In fact, I made all the progress in the first 5-6 months and for almost a year I didn't make any progress. Neither strength not physique wise.

I was now following a workout app called Calisthenics. It's not too bad except it used ridiculously high volume and hardly any change in intensity. I was exhausted after each session, but no substantial progress was made... (to be continued)

● Strength level during this period - 10-12 pull ups, 25 push ups, 12 dips (all max)

#2.2. Training (part 2 August 2020 - Now)

I was becoming suspicious of what I was doing and the advice I was getting. During this time (May-June 2020) I read the book Power to the People by Pavel Insulin and it almost completely changed the way I looked at exercising. It was something very new and interesting. I started getting more and more curious about the concept of strength training; started reading more about it on the internet, frequently visiting Powerlifting related forums and getting more knowledge about bodyweight training. Then I got the book ""Science and Practice of Strength Training"" by Vladimir Zatsiorsky and ""Building the Gymnatics Body"" by Christopher Sommer.  And it changed everything. 

I started building and following my own routine and made huge changes to my training (this is around August-September). The major changes was making the rep range 3-5, upping the intensity, taking more rest time, reducing the number of exercises and focusing compound movements while applying the concept of progressive overload. And my strength increased rapidly!

It's important to know that all this while I was training at home at around 3am (then I used to sleep at daytime and stayed up all night). And for equipment I only had a light red resistance band. I used the kitchen counter to do dips and used an old backpack + some bricks for extra weight in pull ups and dips. In June I bought a pair of gymnastics rings which I hung from the gate. And in late October I started going to the park very early morning (5am) worked out there. I also bought a heavy band (50-70lbs) this November.

● Current strength level - max weighted pull ups is approx 25kg (with a brick between my legs), max weighted dip would be around 30kg (I can do about 4-5 reps with the same brick mentioned above). Chest to Wall Handstand Push Up 5 reps (still can't balance a handstand). 3-4 one arm push ups on each arm (clean form). I can hold a straddle front lever for 5-6 seconds but I'm not training Front Lever anymore so that I can fully focus on one arm chin up training. For one arm chin up I can do band assisted (same light band) OAC with 1 finger distance from the ring and where I hold the band. For back lever (supinated) I can hold about 10s of advance tuck open hips, I feel like I'm almost ready for straddle. I'm also training for bent arm planche on Rings where I'm at around 12-15s with advance tuck open hip position. I'm working on my handstand but still can't balance it. I can hold an L Sit on the floor for 20s. Max bodyweight pull is 15-16. I can also do about 5-6 full Dragon Flag however I never trained for it.

#3. Routine

I follow a template, not a fixed routine as exercises keep changing as I move up the progression ladder. It looks somewhat like this -

Day 1. 

A. OAC Progression 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B1. Back Lever 3-4 sets of 3-5/5s-15s superset with 
B2. 10 Reverse Hyperextension (3 min rest)

C1. Weighted pull up 3 sets of 6-8 (2 min rest)
False Grip Hang 3 sets of max hold superset with 
C2. Bicep curls with that ~25kg brick to failure (1m 30s rest)

Day 2. 

A. The hardest pushing exercise that I can do (right now it is RTO Dips with Rings 90° turned out through out the whole movement) 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B. Elevated Dominik Sky style pike push up 4 sets of 5-8 (3 min rest)

C. Bent Arm Planche progression on Rings 3 sets of 10s-20s (2 min rest)

D. Weighted Dip + heavy band 3 sets of 5-8 (2 min rest)

E. Bodyweight Triceps Extension 3 sets of 10-12 (1m 30s rest)

Then repeat day 1...

Along with these I also train handstand for 20-30 min a day and flexibility + mobility for an hour but different time of the day. Everything combined it takes me about 3 hours a day for a full training.

I didn't die but I had permanent damage to my eyes. I'm visually impaired, have photophobia/light sensitivity (that's why I used to sleep at daytime) and dry eyes. I was in a blind boys hostel from the age of 6-12 where I didn't eat enough. My weight was very low. I used to poop like once in 2 weeks. Not to mention I incredibly weak I was. My parents got separated when I was like 10 and I stayed with my mom. I started working out not to be jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. 

And I'm totally aware of the fact that my progress is very slow, objectly it's very bad. I'm almost 2 years into it what do I have to show for it, freaking elbow lever? I can't even do a handstand or a muscle up which is nothing short of embarrassment at this point. I want to be very good at what I do, and clearly I'm showing no signs to indicate that.

#2.1. Training  (part 1 June 2019 - August 2020)

So when I first started working out, I didn't know anything about how to exercise. At the very beginning I couldn't even do a normal push up I was so weak. I didn't even know pull ups were a thing or the fact you had to actually train your back. I didn't start working to get jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. And the only exercises I knew were push ups, sit ups and squats. I didn't have any equipments, neither did I have time or money to go to a gym. I first started with an app called 30 Day Home Workout Challenge or something like that. It had different variations of push ups and sit ups. It took me about 3 months to build up to 10 normal push ups. During this time I was watching a lot of YouTube videos about bodyweight workouts and fitness in general. I didn't have a pull up bar. So I did my pull ups first on a door ledge and then on a collapsible gate with towels wrapped around it otherwise my hands would bleed. The first time I did negative pull ups, after mere 3 reps I had incredible pain in my elbows that lasted almost a whole week. I could neither fully straighten or bend my arms. However I kept going and slowly, very slowly got better until I could do it for some reps without pain.

I had also stopped using that app and was trying things myself. However I didn't know what I was doing. I thought I knew everything from watching YouTube videos but clearly that was not the case. I was following AthleanX and was doing 17 different curl variations with my 25lbs red resistance tube. Most of my exercises were of the same intensity (didn't change the progressions to make it harder) and I always did everything to failure. Was trying out different things like density training, drop set everything, mechanical drop set everything and what not. I was the perfect example of doing fuckaroundities.

Around last year March it slowly occurred to me that I was not moving forward. There was no progress. In fact, I made all the progress in the first 5-6 months and for almost a year I didn't make any progress. Neither strength not physique wise.

I was now following a workout app called Calisthenics. It's not too bad except it used ridiculously high volume and hardly any change in intensity. I was exhausted after each session, but no substantial progress was made... (to be continued)

● Strength level during this period - 10-12 pull ups, 25 push ups, 12 dips (all max)

#2.2. Training (part 2 August 2020 - Now)

I was becoming suspicious of what I was doing and the advice I was getting. During this time (May-June 2020) I read the book Power to the People by Pavel Insulin and it almost completely changed the way I looked at exercising. It was something very new and interesting. I started getting more and more curious about the concept of strength training; started reading more about it on the internet, frequently visiting Powerlifting related forums and getting more knowledge about bodyweight training. Then I got the book ""Science and Practice of Strength Training"" by Vladimir Zatsiorsky and ""Building the Gymnatics Body"" by Christopher Sommer.  And it changed everything. 

I started building and following my own routine and made huge changes to my training (this is around August-September). The major changes was making the rep range 3-5, upping the intensity, taking more rest time, reducing the number of exercises and focusing compound movements while applying the concept of progressive overload. And my strength increased rapidly!

It's important to know that all this while I was training at home at around 3am (then I used to sleep at daytime and stayed up all night). And for equipment I only had a light red resistance band. I used the kitchen counter to do dips and used an old backpack + some bricks for extra weight in pull ups and dips. In June I bought a pair of gymnastics rings which I hung from the gate. And in late October I started going to the park very early morning (5am) worked out there. I also bought a heavy band (50-70lbs) this November.

● Current strength level - max weighted pull ups is approx 25kg (with a brick between my legs), max weighted dip would be around 30kg (I can do about 4-5 reps with the same brick mentioned above). Chest to Wall Handstand Push Up 5 reps (still can't balance a handstand). 3-4 one arm push ups on each arm (clean form). I can hold a straddle front lever for 5-6 seconds but I'm not training Front Lever anymore so that I can fully focus on one arm chin up training. For one arm chin up I can do band assisted (same light band) OAC with 1 finger distance from the ring and where I hold the band. For back lever (supinated) I can hold about 10s of advance tuck open hips, I feel like I'm almost ready for straddle. I'm also training for bent arm planche on Rings where I'm at around 12-15s with advance tuck open hip position. I'm working on my handstand but still can't balance it. I can hold an L Sit on the floor for 20s. Max bodyweight pull is 15-16. I can also do about 5-6 full Dragon Flag however I never trained for it.

#3. Routine

I follow a template, not a fixed routine as exercises keep changing as I move up the progression ladder. It looks somewhat like this -

Day 1. 

A. OAC Progression 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B1. Back Lever 3-4 sets of 3-5/5s-15s superset with 
B2. 10 Reverse Hyperextension (3 min rest)

C1. Weighted pull up 3 sets of 6-8 (2 min rest)
False Grip Hang 3 sets of max hold superset with 
C2. Bicep curls with that ~25kg brick to failure (1m 30s rest)

Day 2. 

A. The hardest pushing exercise that I can do (right now it is RTO Dips with Rings 90° turned out through out the whole movement) 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B. Elevated Dominik Sky style pike push up 4 sets of 5-8 (3 min rest)

C. Bent Arm Planche progression on Rings 3 sets of 10s-20s (2 min rest)

D. Weighted Dip + heavy band 3 sets of 5-8 (2 min rest)

E. Bodyweight Triceps Extension 3 sets of 10-12 (1m 30s rest)

Then repeat day 1...

Along with these I also train handstand for 20-30 min a day and flexibility + mobility for an hour but different time of the day. Everything combined it takes me about 3 hours a day for a full training.

#4. Nutrition

For hypertrophy or weight gain (and loss) diet is one of the most important factors. However I'm helpless in this situation. I can't afford enough food to get big. I eat what is cooked in home. I don't track my macros or calories. I eat rice twice a day (as lunch and dinner) with curries, a glass of milk, I'm not a vegetarian but I rarely eat meat because it's expensive, I also don't eat fish because it tastes very bad, I eat 1 banana before training right after waking up, 2 eggs, loads of potato and for breakfast or snacks in the evening I eat bread with peanut butter. I also drink sattu which contains a good amount of soy protein (about 20g in 100g/2 glass). I have only gained about 10lbs this year which speaks volume about my diet however there is nothing I can do about that.

1,"Hi all,

So im currently a noob lifter and have been working out on a 4 day split,

- Monday and Thursday
 - flat barbell press 4 x 10
 - deadlifts 5 x 10
 - Overhead press 5 x 10
 - Incline dumbell press 4 x 10
 - dips 4 or 5 x 5 to 10


Tuesday and Friday
 - pull ups or Lat pull down 5 x 10
 - Squats 5 x 10
 - Dumbell seated rows 5 x 10
 - Seated reverse fly 5 x 10
 - Bicep Curl 5 x 10

So this is my 4 day plan... I keep track of my weight and keep them at a range of around 1 maybe 2 from failure. 

The biggest issue I have is that unless i take long breaks by the time I reach the 5th exercise Im pretty rooted and have been finidng that the exercise is super lack luster... 

Last few weeks Ive been cutting the 5th out all together as im pretty flat. 

Im wondering if this is because im new? Starting lifting with my brother (not super structured around 6 months ago) And my body will adjust as I do it more? 

My weekly sets arent crazy high for anything, chest is top with 16 total but that's within the 10 to 20 range i keep hearing.

I posted in thr r/loseit sub and the response i got was to check sleep and diet.

Sleep i aim for 8 hours but get closer to 7. (Rogan and Mathew walker set me on a straight and narrow path on that)

Im currently in a 500 cal deficit, 500 seems to be the amount that most recommend so not sure if this is the problem.","New lifter...

1,"First off if you’re impatient here’s the [pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/245FDYa)

I’ve lurked this subreddit for years and up until about two and a half years ago, I honestly never thought I could bring myself to finally get up to a healthy weight. 

I’m gonna preface this by saying I’ve struggled with body dysmorphia a lot in the past, partly due to my autism and partly due to being called skinny my entire life. HOWEVER, I’ve been relentlessly working on my self-respect and my mental health in general, so it’s leveled out a lot for me.

I should also say, this isn’t a super dramatic transformation and I’m well aware. As I’ll talk about later, I honestly didn’t even set out with gaining weight as a goal until recently, so most of this is just the consequence of living better, not getting fucked up all the time, and eating (a little) better. YMMV. Anyway-

As with so many of you guys, I thought the whole time that it was just my metabolism, and that things would never get better. Well today, I got a memory on my phone of an old shirtless picture. I swear to god y’all my jaw almost hit the floor. I didn’t remember being THAT skinny. So I took another picture of myself today to compare, and that really helped me check my dysmorphia. I have so much trouble actually understanding how I look to other people, but when I saw the pictures back to back it just hit me like a ton of bricks how much healthier I am these days. 

If I’m being real, I didn’t do much to change my weight (at least from a training standpoint). I started doing calisthenics about a year ago and before that I took a job doing electrical work. I’ve also been incredibly lucky to find a partner that loves cooking and eating healthy, and she’s been really helping teach me better habits on that end. After seeing those pictures side by side though, I’ve decided to go all in. I want to feel my best and be as healthy as I possibly can be.

In the morning, in addition to your normal breakfast you're going to make a high-calorie protein/mass-gaining shake.  I'd say aim for \~1000 calories in it (this can vary depending on your calorie needs), and use whole foods, i.e don't drink some store-bought massgainer filled with sugar and other crap. I'm not going to dump a recipe in this post because there are plenty of different shakes to be found by searching on this subreddit or elsewhere.  However, I do have my own recipe that's worked very well for me so if people want to know what it is I'd be happy to share in the comments.  

Again, this isn't a replacement for your normal breakfast or another meal.  Instead, you're going to drink this throughout the day, in between meals or during meals, whenever, as long as you get it down.  This is even easier to do now since many people are still working/taking classes from home.  If you are out of the house for a while during the day, get one of those big hydroflask etc. bottles that will keep it from getting gross and drink it throughout the day.  You can drink it in one sitting if you prefer, but I sometimes feel too sick after doing that.  

This was a game-changer for me the first time I was serious about gaining weight in college a few years ago.  It's much easier to consume/digest a shake than adding an extra big plate of chicken/spinach/rice, and you can get even more calories anyway.  If you spread out your consumption throughout the day you barely notice how much extra food you're getting on top of your normal 3-4 meals.  

Some of you new guys may have already started doing this, and if so props to you because you're on the right path.  Also, this is definitely not something you must do.  You don't need any liquid calories to gain, but if you feel like you're already eating as much as you can, then add this to your diet and I guarantee you will see results.

If you spread out your consumption throughout the day you barely notice how much extra food you're getting on top of your normal 3-4 meals.  

Some of you new guys may have already started doing this, and if so props to you because you're on the right path.  Also, this is definitely not something you must do.  You don't need any liquid calories to gain, but if you feel like you're already eating as much as you can, then add this to your diet and I guarantee you will see results.  

Happy gaining!"

Age: 26

Height: 6' 1"" (185 cm)

Weight: 145lbs -&gt; 185lbs (Yes, I was so skinny, my ribs were showing)

I've been weight lifting for about a year, (minus a few weeks due to injuries) and I've been using the famous Reddit PPL ([http://archive.is/gMUfM](http://archive.is/gMUfM)) and have seen significant gains from that. I don't see linear progression anymore and find it hard to add weight every session now. What is the logical next step? I wouldn't consider myself advanced enough to write my own workout program and I really enjoy the PPL. Are there any modifications I can make to the PPL or should I move onto a different program? 

I'm not really seeing any gains after the 185lb mark, been here for a while now. I may have to increase my calorie/protein intake but any other tips for plateauing? I've also been working out at home because of the pandemic, I have the basics like dbs, bbs, and a bench but I don't have any fancy equipment.

1,"Mythical Strength recently made a post talking about GOMAD and pushed me to make a post sharing my experiences, as I've been doing it since 2018 (with a 10 month break because I stopped training). [Here is his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/kug8ma/the_gallon_of_milk_a_day_gomad_doing_it_right). He specifically stated GOMAD is not sustainable and I'm going to go over why that's wrong. I'll include some tips that winners do as well.

Disclaimer: You don't do this for health reasons, I am in no way advocating you should drink a gallon of milk every day to get more vitamin D. You do it because of the calories, macros, price, and most of all it's so fucking easy. If you can tolerate milk and have trouble gaining weight then I have no sympathy for you. Also I'd like to point out that my opinion doesn't matter, but I'm gonna give it to you anyway.

I'm 6'3, before I started lifting I weighed 165lbs. My peak is 240lbs. I took a long break from lifting and dropped down to 170ish by the time I returned, which was this past August. I am now back to 230 with most of my strength back. I don't know why I feel compelled to say this, but if your activity level goes way down, stop drinking so much milk.

Always whole milk, anything else and you're just pulling your pud. Also, put the empty pints away, drink it straight from the jug or you'll spend all day pouring and doing dishes. 

Much like training, you don't start out pounding a gallon of milk in one sitting. That is one of my goals, but I always chicken out after a half gallon. I started out at 3 gallons a week, and I wasn't even trying to do GOMAD, it was just how much milk I drank. I jumped to 4 very quickly after that and that's when I realized how little effort it took to gain weight versus actually having to chew so much damn food. From there it just felt intuitive and I drank it like water. If you want to reach a gallon a day, progressively overload your milk intake, you will hardly notice it once you have achieved a gallon a day/enlightenment. When you are drinking that much milk, drinking it is refreshing. If I ever get nausea, milk is the first thing I reach for. When I use to go to commercial gyms, I would bring a big ass thermos that held about a quarter gallon of milk with me and drink it between sets.

Maintaining for the long term works great assuming you don't develop some sensitivity towards lactate. Here are three questions people ask me when they find out I drink a lot of milk:

**Won't that make you really fat?**- It can if you don't use your body for anything. 

**Isn't that really unhealthy?**- It's probably not the healthiest thing you could be doing, but it's not as bad as you might think. I've had plenty of checkups with my doctor and blood tests. The only thing that was abnormal in my blood tests is creatinine levels, which are elevated because that's what they do when you exercise. Also, there are people that drink soda everyday and I rarely feel the need to ever drink any because I slam so much milk.

**Doesn't that get crazy expensive?**- No. Think of all of the other things you don't have to buy because so much of your intake is coming from milk, then compare how much that costs to milk. It's pretty damn efficient moneywise. You don't need to buy whey either, protein powder is just derivatives of milk anyway so it's redundant. 

I'm closing, GOMAD isn't a meme. Weighing less than 200lbs as an adult male is, and maxing out your bodyweight squat/deadlift while taking 3 different supplements + mass gainer then complaining about being skinny is. Adding raw weight to your body and lifts isn't.  It is sustainable and will probably make your life easier, as a big chunk of your macros and calories are predetermined. In fact, it's really well suited as a long term approach. It works, and it works a lot better if you're working hard enough to warrant it.",GOMAD long term,"GOMAD long term Mythical Strength recently made a post talking about GOMAD and pushed me to make a post sharing my experiences, as I've been doing it since 2018 (with a 10 month break because I stopped training).

1,"Hi all! I am 32, 170cm (~5ft 7"") 70kg (~154b)

Two months ago, after losing enough body fat, I started a bulking phase (for the first time in my life). As I read everywhere, I started increasing bit by bit my caloric intake, however I kept losing weight, so I ended up reaching 3000 calorie/day, and now I am finally gaining weight.

However, according to my scale (which, although not very precise, is quite consistent), the rate at which I am gaining seems, at least to me, quite slow.

When I started the bulking, I was around 68kg (~150lb). After two months (the first one I was adjusting the caloric intake, and then Christmas came...), while in an upper/lower workout routine for 4 days a week + some cardio after upper training + 1 specific cardio day, I am at 70kg (~154lb). According to the scale, I gained approximately 1kg of muscle, and 2 points of bf percentage.

1,"About 10 weeks ago, I began my process of bulking. In that 10 weeks time, I put on approximately 6 pounds. I still have a long ways to go, but I’ve enjoyed my time in this sub, thanks for everyone who has helped! I know none of this stuff is revolutionary, and I am not as good of a writer as some poster on here, but this is what I would have told myself 10 weeks ago:

-Don’t go “all in” right away. I think this is a common mistake, I realized I really needed to put on weight, got a little scared, and ended up eating the most food I had had in a single sitting. I felt like crap for the next 2 days. I felt full for these days and in turn, probably ended up eating less.

-I was eating a lot less than I thought I was. Again, I think this is pretty common, I thought I was eating a lot, but when you don’t eat for 6,7,8 hours after breakfast, it’s almost impossible to get in enough calories. 

-I feel so much better, in almost all aspects of life. I no longer feel tired all the time, I’m getting better sleep, and despite it being counterintuitive, I am literally running faster than I ever have in my life. I was hesitant to “bulk” as a distance runner, because a low body weight is so emphasized in the sport. But too little is probably worse than too much, I look forward to running so much more, and have a new love for the sport. 

-I don’t care if I put on a bit of fat. I definitely had some body image issues going on, and thought I wouldn’t like how I looked bigger, it’s the complete opposite. I look more full, and yes I have some fat, but that’s honestly for the better in my case. 

-I’m weak as hell. This is more of a goal looking to the future, as I have made major progress, but still can’t really lift to save my life. I’ve been running Westside for Skinny Bastards, and seriously enjoyed it. 

In the end, I may not have put on as much weight or even as much muscle as I probably could have. I missed meals, messed up workouts and so on. But I'm doing what makes me feel the best and be the happiest and don’t regret any of it. I feel so much better than I did beforehand, and plan on only getting stronger and better.

1,"Hello everyone, I [f/23] am new to all of this and after going through the FAQ page, I am really set in mind to start this weight gaining journey, in hopes that I achieve my dream body before our wedding (in 9 months)
Now my only issue right now is with my fiance, I am the cook in our relationship and I basically pick what meals we eat, when we eat them, etc. As I am a very picky eater while he is pretty chill with everything and can eat anything anytime. He is trying to lose weight though, nothing hardcore, but he's trying to atleast NOT gain weight. His diet is mainly cutting out most of the carbs, so rice, bread, pasta etc. and replacing it with other alternatives like cauliflower rice, Zucchini pasta, protein bread and so on. 

So what I used to do so far when cooking meals for us, was that I cooked the protein (meat) by itself, and then made some rice/pasta for me, and another carb-free alternative for him.
But now looking at the type of food I would have to eat to gain weight, I feel like I wouldnt always be able to provide an alternative for him for the same meal, and instead cook something completely different, which is just is too much work especially since my daily meals would increase as well.

Anyone is/was in the same boat as me? How can I add a new diet for me to follow without affecting his diet significantly? Is there a way maybe to meal prep somehow so that it would be less work?

1,"I've been lifting seriously for around 3-4 years.

I weigh 78kg or 173lbs and am around 16% bodyfat @ 5ft 8/173cm/1.72 m

My nutrition is great and I always hit my macros.


I usually train one body part a day and always push myself very hard. I don't really reserve energy and go to failure in all my working set. 

Monday: Chest
Always start with heavy dumbell press 5 sets of 5 reps, 4 sets of failure for upper and lower chest on incline dumbell press, 5 sets of cable or dumbell flys

Tuesday: Biceps
15 minutes of light weight, trying to activate my bicep and get good mind muscle connection (biceps are terrible)
Usually superset weighted pullups into seated bicep curls and then a burn out with lower weight. I repeat these 3 exercises 4 times with around a minute and a half rest time between

Wednesday: Back
Back really isn't an issue for me as I have decent genetics for it. Seated row machine for 5 sets of failure reps into 4 sets of bent over rows, and then 4 sets of rack pulls to failure

Thursday: Shoulders
Shoulders are similar to my back, where I have decent genetics. I usually start with something like a seated shoulder press doing 10+ reps to failure for 4 sets and then doing the same with rear delt flys. I will then usually do a burnout drop set

Friday: Legs
Begin with heavy squats, 5 sets of 5 into 4 sets of 10+ reps to failure on leg press. 4 sets of machine leg extensions to 10+ reps failure and the same with hamstring curls. Then I finish off with calf raises with weight to failure for 8 or so sets. My calves suck...

From June 2018 to January 2021

Disclosure: I had a little weight training experience from college so some of these gains were ""muscle memory-esque"". Really never looked anything close to impressive in college though, and I feel I hit college level after a month or two of lifting again.

There was one cut between these photographs. It was from 213lbs to 187lbs and I would consider it a failure considering how much muscle/strength I lost.

My routine started as a high volume high intensity ""fucking around"" routine where I focused on mind muscle connection and doing what I wanted. Gained some good size doing that, but lost a bunch from my cut.

I eventually decided to start tracking my lifts and following an actual program and have been doing the following routine for about a year and half: https://rippedbody.com/intermediate-bodybuilding-program/

I modify the program to fit my needs in many ways though. It's more of a skeleton. It has been quite successful for me.

I eat a ton of food, usually only focusing on protein goals. I take creatine and sometimes whey protein. Chicken, rice, canned fish, sweets, fruits, milk, nuts, stews, etc. Gaining weight through the 220s was very slow going and tough.

I hope it doesn't need to be said due to my size and conditioning, but I am very much natty.

**Next Steps?** Cutting. Soon I am going to try again and cut more slowly, keep weights heavy, and add even more protein.","[Progress] 6'1"" 175lbs-&gt;231lbs - 56 pounds gained over 2.5 years","[Progress] 6'1"" 175lbs-&gt;231lbs - 56 pounds gained over 2.5 years https://imgur.com/a/93sAjgz

1,"Just wanted to see if anyone else here is a super hard gainer like me. Getting a bit worried. 

I’m 6’2”, 24 years old healthy male. Been training for 4 years or so.

Last year I gained 12 pounds (168-180) after surgery in a matter of 6 months, while slowly increasing my maintenance calories from 3700 to 4100.

Recently, the weight have stalled around 180 pounds, and I had to increase my intake to 4,200 calories.. looks like the scale hasn’t moved at all for the 5 days. 

The problem is - I don’t live a super active lifestyle. A sedentary office job with gym 3 times a week, but the calories I need to eat are higher than many people on this sub. My TDEE should be way lower than this. 

I track everything diligently using Cronometer, averaging exactly what I plan for the day - 4,200.

Should I just accept my ridiculous metabolism and keep increasing calories until the scale starts to move? At what point should I be seeing a doctor? 

My goal by the end of the year is to be 210lbs, so that’s a little less than 4lb for me to gain in a month. I don’t mind some fat, but I can’t imagine how much I’d need to eat to get there. 

I don’t have any tapeworms for reference. Have had colonoscopy last year.

Anyone with a similar story?

1,"Hey everyone, I’m pretty new to this sub and lifting. I just started hitting the gym again after 9 months and lifting weights and I’ve noticed a problem with my squat. Every time I start to prepare myself before and as I’m squatting towards the ground, my back seems to jut out (https://thebarbellphysio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Squat-Spine-Control.png) Similar to the picture I start out in the position in the left panel and as I go down my posture is similar to the middle panel. Once I’m fully down it still looks similar to the middle panel of the picture. I’m kind of skinny, 6’ 2” and have long legs so I’m not sure whether I just instinctually go into this position to hold my balance or whether it’s just a habit that’s formed while squatting. Anyways is there a way I can effectively fix this? Should I continue squatting or should I be doing some exercises to help control this hyperextending of the back? Also any tall people have tips for how I should position my legs? I seem to really widen my stance and point my toes out so that I don’t lose balance as I go down. Thank you for the help!!

So I've been running the FAQ 6 day PPL program which has me deadlifting once a week.

I've been hovering around 185-195 for the last 4 weeks. I did feel my back rounding last week so I think it might be a form issue.

1,"Howdy Gainers,

**INTRO**

The infamous ""GOMAD"" approach to gaining weight has been around for about a hundred years now, with pioneers such as Milo Steinborn and Joseph Curtis (JC) Hise leading the charge on it in it's infancy and other great men of strength such as Paul Anderson and Doug Hepburn continuing it's momentum.  It's been written about by authors such as John McCallum and Randall Strossen, and even advocated by more modern types such as Chase Karnes and Matt Reynolds.  HOWEVER, as is often the case with great ideas, the telephone game (I'm dating myself there I'm such: do kids call it the textmessage game now?) has been in effect, and much of the truth behind this method has been lost.  I figure it's worth having a discussion on the subject.


**MY BACKGROUND/EXPERIENCE**

I did the gallon of milk a day approach to gaining back in 2006, while I was in college and on a meal plan, which definitely made things easier.  I paired it with the ""Super Squats"" program, as that is where the idea was heavily emphasized.  You can read about that program [here](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Super+Squats&amp;qid=1610290584&amp;sr=8-1).

In the 6 weeks I drank the gallon of milk a day and ran the program, I also ate a diet that consisted of a LOT of food, and ended up putting on 12lbs in 6 weeks.  I drank 2% milk, as we did not have whole milk in our dinning hall.

Prior to drinking a gallon of milk a day, I had legit not had milk as a beverage since my childhood.   This required a re-acclimation to milk, which I will discuss momentarily.

**WHAT GOMAD IS NOT**

* Healthy.  Understand that from the forefront.  That's not the point of it.  If your goal is maximal health, you should NOT be drinking a gallon of milk a day.  

* Sustainable.  This is a blitz approach, paired with extreme training, to get extreme results.  You won't be doing this for life.  6 weeks was right for me.  Some folks run it for longer. 

* A first resort.  A lot of trainees want to jump onto GOMAD right away, but this is something that's done AFTER you have real nutrition sorted out.  If you're living off weight gain shakes and don't know how to boil water, do NOT do GOMAD.  Learn to cook.  [Try here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ijjm9h/bachelor_bulking_quit_making_shakes_learn_how_to/)

**WHAT GOMAD IS**

* A way to get in an extra 2000+ calories a day with a ton of protein on TOP of a already heavy diet.  The reason milk is advocated is because liquid tends to ""fill in the cracks"" left behind when you have a full stomach.  Basically, you always have room for milk, so while you're mainlining solid calories you can use the milk to get in even MORE restorative calories to recover from VERY intense training.  And that's the thing: don't just drink a gallon of milk a day and run Starting Strength.  You need to be training hard enough that you NEED all those extra calories.

* A last resort.  Maybe not THE last resort, but things should definitely be squared away on the rest of the nutritional front BEFORE you do this.  A gallon of milk a day on top of a terrible diet is going to mean terrible results.

**MISTAKES PEOPLE MAKE**

* If you are like me and NOT a regular milk drinker, do NOT just jump into a gallon of milk a day overnight.  Super Squats and Brawn both talk about how one needs to ease into milk consumption.  I started off by drinking a glass of milk at night before bed for a week.  It was a great way to get in a few extra calories before sleeping, and helped get my gut used to milk while I was too busy being unconscious to feel it's effects.  I then started working a glass of milk into one of my meals of the day on top of the glass before bed.  Eventually all meals had a glass of milk with them, and then I was ready to fully commit to the process.

* On the above, I don't discount that people ARE lactose intolerant, but I also imagine some folks are just not accustomed to drinking milk, and easing into the process will help redevelop that tolerance.  If you ARE lactose intolerant, this is, of course, a terrible idea, and you should not do it.

* Drinking the milk too quickly.  Don't try to get your gallon knocked out so it's ""out of the way"": drink it over the course of the day.  You'll feel much better.

**IF I DID IT AGAIN**

I'd go with something like fairlife or raw milk personally.  As I get older, I'm trying to put better things in my body.  But for a broke college kid, ""free"" milk was awesome.

Hey everyone, I wanted to ask you guys what are some realistic strength goals to set for the new year, and what may be good programs or programming ideas to achieve these goals 

Here [https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/workouts/stevedensitystrength.pdf ] is my current program, I’m on week 14 of 16, and I really like it, and I’ve been making good progress (+5 pounds every week on all my barbell lifts) 

I’ve attached my current estimated ORM’s (estimates by symmetric strength, I’ve also included the lifts I imputed to calculate those maxes, or in some cases estimates done by me), it’s important to note before running my current program I did all stupid self programming and really only wanted to gain strength in weights Dio’s and chins ups, so I have terrible strength imbalances. I didn’t even start OHPing until about may of 2020. I was a big idiot. Some imbalances are also because I train from home and have limited equipment so I was not or currently am not able to train certain movements. 

I am 18, 5’10 and weigh 210lbs, I first started working out with basic calisthenics almost 3 years ago, my estimated maxes are 

Bench: 260-270 (225-230X5-6)
OHP 180 (165X3)
Deadlift:315X6-8
Barbell Hack squat (don’t have a squat rack) 315X6-8
Weighted dip +135X8-10 
Weighted chin up: +90X3-5
Cheat row:255X8-9

*if it changes anything, I do my OHP from my bench by putting the pegs at the highest slot, and then turning and facing the wall while seated, but no back support. 

*DIps and chins numbers were from lifts from when I was a little lighter, though I’m fairly certain as I’ve gained weight I’ve kept the same weight added. 



I really look forward to getting stronger, I’d like to build up my bench, OHP, and deadlift a lot, but I also would like to continue in strengthening my Dips and Chins. Should I re run my current program or maybe look into something new? Maybe try something totally different or invest I chains or a sling shot?

What is the FEED CONVERSION RATIO, and does it have any relevance to hard-gainers? Yes, so tuck in for a long read. You need to know that foods you eat are not 100% utilized. You do not digest everything you eat. Some of the calories you eat slip out the other end. **Digestion is never 100% efficient.** How can we know this? Well, pardon the ""yuck""-factor, but if you've ever seen corn or peas in your stool, you know it. If lactose makes you gassy, that attests to this. The very fact that 30% of nuts you eat are eliminated, if not well-chewed, is also proof of this. THIS is why I often say, ""You're not a hard-gainer, you're a hard-digester"". This is often the result of mal-absorption.

**See, it's not how much you can eat, it's how much you can digest.** And some people are just ""not as good"" at digestion. This isn't your ""metabolism"", this is poor food utilization. Additional factors contribute to our ability to process the foods we eat. Food calories can be lost in other ways, to other physiological processes. But we want to maximize the conversion of our calories into weight gain, correct? This is why I wanted to take a moment to have a closer look at this concept of Feed Conversion Ratio. Where does this ratio come from? And does it have any relevance to a hardgainer simply trying to put on good weight?

This Feed Conversion Ratio comes from the livestock industry. These are the folks who fatten up pigs and cattle, to get them to market. These are the people who are highly invested in getting their animals quickly to a certain weight. The animal's gains are literally the farmer's profits. And it would be ideal if each pound of feed produced a pound of meat. But it's nowhere close to this number! The ratio averages 3:1 in the example of a pig. It takes roughly 3 pounds of feed to yield 1 pound of weight. As an example, you might feed 665 pounds of feed to a pig in the weeks it weighs between 40 pounds and 280 pounds. You would calculate the ratio as ""665 pounds of feed divided by 240 pounds of weight gain for a score of 2.77"". You could thus say ""the Feed Conversion Ratio is 2.77:1"" in this instance.

Now, every animal has a different score for feeding efficiency. For beef cattle, FCR calculated on live weight gain of 4.5–7.5 was in the normal range with an FCR above 6 being typical. Some data for sheep illustrate variations in FCR. An FCR (kg feed dry matter intake per kg live mass gain) for lambs is often in the range of about 4 to 5 on high-concentrate rations. As of 2011 in the US, broiler chickens has an FCR of 1.6 based on body weight gain, and mature in 39 days. A lower first number in the ratio is desirable, as less feed is required to yield the same amount of meat.

If it requires 6 pounds of feed to make each pound of beef, versus 3 pounds of feed to produce a pound of pork, versus only 1.6 pounds of feed to grow a pound of chicken, then it's obvious that chicken is more economic in the simple sense that you spend less on animal food to grow the animal for market sale. But even on a species-by-species basis, there is variance within the species breed-by-breed. Sure, the average for a pig is 3:1. But some breeds of pigs might require 3.5 pounds of feed, on average, to gain a pound of weight, while another breed of pig only needs 2.6 pounds of feed to gain that same pound of pork. The latter breed gains weight &amp; muscle with less food.

By this logic, we must extrapolate a conclusion that even among human people, there is not an equal ability to convert food into weight with an identical efficiency. We cannot assume that everyone responds to food (calories) in an identical manner. Is this due to ""metabolism""? Largely, NO. Studies in metabolic wards have confirmed that although some people do have higher basal metabolic rates (resting metabolism), the effect is very slight. It's on the order of about 150-200 calories. Of people with identical height, weight, and body composition, one person might burn 150 more calories in a day. That's really not a lot. So what's going on with hardgainers who swear up &amp; down that they're eating so much more than everyone else? Is this really happening?

First, can we even find a Feed Conversion Ratio for humans? It doubtlessly exists. But that would be beyond the scope of this article. Moreover, it would be highly impractical as well as unethical. For starters, we aren't eating an iso-caloric pelletized food kibble for all of our food intake needs. We also aren't looking at basic-rate growth from infancy-to-adulthood based on per-pound of feed; we're looking in the particular context of weight gain in response to resistance-training hypertrophy. But we don't need to know a rate of efficiency. It's enough to know that the absorption &amp; assimilation of food is variable. And it's affected by other variables, besides enzymatic digestion.

Environment and Temperature can have a big effect on appetite. A pig’s environment can affect its food consumption and conversion. The ambient temperature of the pen must be kept in the thermo-neutral range or it will have a negative influence on a pig’s appetite. Pigs that are cold will eat more feed. Pigs that are hot will eat less. High humidity can also reduce appetite, as can poor ventilation. As a human goes, I can personally attest that I don't want to eat as much when it's too warm, or too stuffy. If ""poor appetite"" is a complaint of yours, this could be one explanation: Your environment is simply too warm for you to get the signal to eat for warmth! A meal should make you warm, due in part to the thermic effect of food. Digesting food requires your body to ramp up, and if you're already warm, hunger may be blunted or muted altogether. And conversely, if it's far too cold, animals will eat more, but also burn more, for heat. Some calories will be lost to heat, when they could have been used for growth.

Are we pigs in a pen being raised for food? Certainly not. But is it unreasonable to assume ambient temperatures play a factor in appetite, as well as metabolism, in the human? Burning body fat for heat is an element of ""calories out"", and it's the largest component of non-exercise energy expenditure. Are you guilty of insisting on wearing a T-shirt in the house during Winter, instead of bundling up a little bit indoors? Not-eating when too warm can impair appetite some of the time, coupled with over-burning when exposed to cooler temperatures and needlessly burning calories for heat another part of the time, can both contribute to impaired weight gain for two different reasons.

Animal Stress also factors into appetite strength. If the density of pigs in the pen is too high, they will experience stress which results in eating less. I'm aware that only so many extrapolations can be made from our pig-farming corollary here, but this also bears legitimacy: People, too, often eat less in times of stress (some are known to eat more, but that's not our demographic). Common stress can play a big role in appetite impairment. So it goes without saying, you might be experiencing stressors in your life, even if unbeknownst to you. Making time to relax before eating a meal might help unlock some of that. A simple 10-minute walk to clear your head and get some fresh air can work wonders in giving your appetite the boost it needs. Mindfulness &amp; meditation may also promote de-stressing.

To shift back to another topic, there is also an effect that results in poor food utilization, which I call the ""Novel Meal Phenomenon"". This is the result of an excessively varied diet, to which the body does not have sufficient time to adapt. This is something you can observe if you've ever had a dog: They acclimatize to their particular brand of dog food and this produces a firm healthy stool. But if you switch food brands suddenly, they'll typically have loose stools for the next couple of days while they adjust to the different macro composition and nutritional profile of the food. This is why it is recommended to mix a little of the new food with the food the dog is already accustomed to, in order to gradually transition the dog to the new food over a couple of weeks, rather than switching all at once. This gives your canine companion some time to re-calibrate its own production of digestive enzymes.

When you are exposed to many of the same foods on a regular basis, your body starts to anticipate them and becomes more efficient at processing them. And although there's still not 100% conversion to usable calories for energy, repair, and growth, more of the total food value is harnessed. If you are often troubled by loose and sloppy bowel movements, it might be due to the novel foods that you've eaten; you've thrown your gut biome a curve-ball. (It's not that those foods are necessarily ""bad"", and had you eaten only those meals, you likewise would have adapted to them over time, by modifying your endogenous enzyme profile). It's a demonstrable fact many people are enzyme-deficient. Some have a poor stomach pH, and will not absorb foods the same way as someone else can. But this is easily remedied. There's a limit to what enzymes you can make, but not to which enzymes you can take.

This is why I'm continually recommending either supplemental digestive enzymes, or enzyme-rich food sources, or both, if you're trying to gain meaningful mass. If you provide digestive support, you will convert more of the foods you eat into mass. If you're hell-bent on running GOMAD (Gallon of Milk a Day), but milk always makes you gassy and crampy, Dairy is probably not a desirable candidate food. (Though if you're determined to attempt it, it would behoove you to either drink only lactose-free milk, or take a lactase-containing digestive supplement alongside it each time. What sense is there throwing a food into the mix, if you're unable to process a component of the food?) Additionally, there is value in probiotics for gut biome support. 

Simply lowering the stomach pH (making it more acidic) can also help. Eating more citrus fruits, berries, and fibrous greens is another tactic to improve digestion. You'll be getting necessary vitamin C, valuable polyphenols and other micro-nutrients, but the biggest value is in digestive support. They also contain fermentable carbs that nourish the gut biome. These are the intestinal bacteria that help digest your other foods. Some of the things you cannot digest, your gut flora will digest for you. Then, you digest the gut flora, and the circle is complete. A thriving gut biome is absolutely necessary not only for raw digestion, but for overall health. At times, I've also kept a bottle of lemon juice in the fridge (not lemonade, but un-sugared, un-watered-down pure lemon juice), of which I drink a Tablespoon-sized shot after a large and bloating meal; it greatly assists in breaking down foods.

Further, this is also why I recommend sticking to 3 or 4 of the same meals which comprise 90% of your bulking diet. Find a handful of meals you don't mind eating all the time. Beef &amp; rice, chicken &amp; pasta, chili &amp; cornbread, beef &amp; bean burritos, tuna sandwiches, whatever your jam is. Rotating through the same small selection of meals will make food prep easier, it will make calorie tracking easier, and it ultimately helps take the guesswork out of what to eat next when it's time to eat again. But equally important, your delicate gut biome will become more adept and adroit and maximizing food absorption. More of the calories you consume will convert into usable energy, primarily in the form of meaningful weight gain. Try thinking of your stomach &amp; intestines as a living creature you have to take care of, like an exotic pet. And when you provide for all the needs of this magical animal, it returns the favor by nourishing and growing YOUR body in return. When it is happy and healthy, it will bestow great gains upon you!

1,"Hello all.. stats to begin: M, 18, 5'9"", 116ish lbs

I have been tracking my weight daily for about a month now and it has only gone down about 2 pounds. I don't really know where to add more food to my day, especially the days that I work. I work at a fast-food restaurant (let's just say we are pretty popular here in the Midwest). I work from 5:30am-2pm four days a week. I don't eat breakfast before I leave my house seeing as I leave quite early. I eat my breakfast on my break at 8am and my lunch at 2:30pm when I get home. My schedule and calories is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

**Breakfast: (about 400 cal)**

handful or 2 of cheerios before leaving home, coffee on my drive, packed breakfast of apple, 1/2 pb and j

**Lunch/pre-workout meal: (about 400 cal)**

wrap made of tortilla, meat, mayo and mustard, veggie straws on side and usually a little caffeine boost for pre-workout

I know this number is below what I should be consuming, but the thing is I don't know where to add more food.

I have been tracking my weight daily for about a month now and it has only gone down about 2 pounds. I don't really know where to add more food to my day, especially the days that I work. I work at a fast-food restaurant (let's just say we are pretty popular here in the Midwest). I work from 5:30am-2pm four days a week. I don't eat breakfast before I leave my house seeing as I leave quite early. I eat my breakfast on my break at 8am and my lunch at 2:30pm when I get home. My schedule and calories is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

**Breakfast: (about 400 cal)**

handful or 2 of cheerios before leaving home, coffee on my drive, packed breakfast of apple, 1/2 pb and j

**Lunch/pre-workout meal: (about 400 cal)**

wrap made of tortilla, meat, mayo and mustard, veggie straws on side and usually a little caffeine boost for pre-workout

**Post-Workout: (150 cal)**

1 scoop ON protein powder with 1 cup of almond milk

1,"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for all of the useful information over the years as I've lurked. My bulking journey has been good, but we should always strive for better than where we were before, and you all have helped me push towards that ideal of continuous self-improvement.

Throwaway-ish because I don't want any medical information associated with my main account.

Over the past several years, I've been dealing with some odd medical issues that have culminated in a tremendous amount of kidney stone passages, muscle weakness, fatigue, and other negative physiological symptoms. The mystery has finally been narrowed down as it has gotten worse, and the gist of it is that I will have to slow/put on hold my bulking journey until we figure out how to preserve my kidney functioning. I'm in my early 20s, the prime time to be putting on some muscle, so this threw a bit of a wrench into my plans.

I'm going to be be on a low-protein (\~.8-1 g/kg) + high alkaline (fruits and veggies) diet, absolutely zero creatine supplementation, and lower-calories overall (no more high-calorie surpluses, so close to  maintenance).

I ask for no sympathy, and am only posting this to remind everyone to keep maximizing your gains while you can - one day you might not have the option!

I know this subreddit usually leans towards *maximizing* gains, but any recommendations on *optimizing*  gains with a restricted diet are greatly appreciated. Of course, I'll talk to my doctor further, but the ""collective wisdom of the crowds"" in a subreddit often offers interesting ideas!

(side note: bulking did not cause the issues at all, so don't get afraid of  protein, but continuing a bulking diet won't be good for someone like me. Don't worry about it if you have regular kidney functioning! I'm just the odd one out haha).","Kidney issues substantially slowing my journey - reminder to ""gain it"" while you can!","Kidney issues substantially slowing my journey - reminder to ""gain it"" while you can!

I'm a beginner to fitness and nutrition, and I need an outside opinion on this. For reference, I'm male, 5'11"", 145 pounds, and my goal is 160 with some visible muscle. Then maybe I'll keep going. This is my current routine:

* 4 moderately intense 30 min workouts a week (full body, upper body, lower body, and abs)
* 2700 calories a day (was previously only eating 1500-1700)
* 130g protein a day
* 347 carbs a day
* 90g fat a day

I'm using the app Lifesum to track my meals and the app Fitness Coach to set up my workouts. I basically put in my info and do what they tell me do to, which to me seems reasonable based on what I've read online. All my workouts are at home, all I have is a mat and a set of resistance bands.

What do you guys think? Am I bulking too much? Should I try to work out more frequently? Are these apps trash? I'd like to transition to a PPL routine once I can afford to go to the gym but for now I just want to make sure I'm not making a fool of myself.

1,"20M, skinny my whole life. A while ago I used to infrequently have Gold Standard Whey protein shakes, but ever since I began working out consistently at the beginning of this year, I've been using Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass instead of whey because of the high calorie content. My shake consists of 1 scoop of the gainer, 2 cups of whole milk, a banana, 2 spoonfuls of Greek yogurt, and a spoonful of peanut butter. Each one is about 1470 calories, I can usually only handle one a day (two if spaced out by several hours). I've seen all the ingredients in my shake besides the gainer recommended for whey shakes, but am I getting similar muscle/nutrition benefit by swapping the whey for the gainer and continuing to add in everything else? I'm asking because in past threads, people have criticized the use of mass gainer _by itself_ and have instead recommended a homemade mass shake that often contains everything else I already put in my shakes (on top of the gainer itself).",Replacing whey protein with mass gainer?,"Replacing whey protein with mass gainer? 20M, skinny my whole life.

To summarise, my question is will doing pressing movements like bench press and incline bench give enough stimulus to grow my front delts optimally or is having a designated front delt movement still required to get the best shoulder gains?"

1,"I've recently developed a tendinous injury in the tricep tendon where it connects to the olecranon in the elbow joint. I notice this pain on my push days, originating with my bench press and becoming gradually worse after incline dumbbell press and peaking during tricep machine pushdowns. This leads me to believe my bench form is off, causing me to push mainly with my triceps rather than pecs. 

Besides lightening tricep load, I want to fix my form on these three exercises. I changed a lot in my bench press. First, I adopted a wider grip to emphasize the pecs, and also tried a bulldog grip with my hands. I also made sure to keep my elbows about 70-75º and not flare them out or into my torso. Finally, I'm more mindful of my upper body position: squeeze my scapulae together, push my chest out, and move the bar in a diagonal path rather than straight up and down. 

As for the tricep pulldown, I'm not sure what to change. I keep my elbows near my torso and my ROM is pretty wide, starting slightly above 90º and pushing down until my triceps stretch all the way. For some reason, this exercise hurts my elbow the most. 

Basically my reason for this post is to see if anyone has dealt with similar pain and gain advice on what else I could change to avoid this in the future when I start push exercises again.

1,"Hi,

I’m quite tall (191cm) and I weigh 65kg. I’m 22 years old. I’m very thin and I dream of weighing about 80 to 90kg (with muscles). I don’t think I’ll ever reach that anytime soon but in the meantime my mindset is to gain as much weight as I can.

In November, for about a month, I tried to have a proper diet : basically I multiplied by ~2 the quantity of food I usually eat. It was a difficult diet, both physically (it’s not easy to force myself when I just want to throw up) and financially. I didn’t try to « optimise » the diet by selecting only certain types of foods but instead, as I said, I just ate more of what I usually eat. Instead of having 100grams of pasta I would have 250grams. Instead of eating 3/4 of a pizza I would eat it all plus add 100grams of extra mozzarella. Same goes with other foods like chicken.

I must have had about 140 grams of proteins per day and more carbs than I needed (forgot the average quantity). I also have weights at home and did on average 20mins of workout per day. Despite this diet I didn’t gain a single gram (I weighed myself every evening before bedtime). It just makes no sense. I ate way more than I used to, so logically I should’ve been able to at the very least notice a small difference, right ? What’s more I did that during lockdown so my only physical activity were my workouts.

I stopped the diet not because I decided to give up but for ""logistical"" reasons (I went back to live with my family and I have very little authority in the kitchen ^^).

I was hoping someone could give me some advice on what to do now that I’m gonna go back to live alone and become independent. Any actionable tips? Maybe a secret life hack! I’m trying to find motivation to start again.

I was also wondering: considering I probably wouldn’t have any trouble burning fat (although I never experienced having fat in my entire life) would it be such a bad idea to eat a lot of junk food? I mean soda, sweets, chocolate bars and so on. I keep hearing people who avoid that sort of food because they’re afraid of getting fat. So why shouldn’t I just eat what fat peoples avoid eating? It probably sounds silly but I’m that desperate.

Background info - 6’0” and started at 10 stone (140lbs), was tired of being super skinny and decided to do something about it February/March of 2020.

Diet - During this time I lived with my parents so I would eat what they provided, I’ve always had a small appetite and most of the time couldn’t finish the meal in front of me. I calculated that I need to eat an excess of 2700 calories a day for me to gain weight. When I saw this number I was initially blown away because I couldn’t believe that I would be able to reach that especially with my appetite. But then after working out my appetite became larger and I was more hungrier throughout the day. I would eat all my meals which would consist of mostly chicken, rice, beef burgers, sausages, bananas, pasta and omelettes. Only as of recently I’ve started integrating sardines into my diet. It goes without saying that I couldn’t of gained as much weight as I have if it wasn’t for high calorie protein shakes, I would combine this with all sorts of fruits and yoghurt and peanut butter to bump them calories up. 
I didn’t track my calories and only ate more if I wasn’t satisfied with my weight the next week.

Routine - When I started working out, it was peak lockdown so everything was closed. No gyms to go to so I had to do workouts at home. I had one Dumbbell that my father had and only applied 5 kgs to it to start. I did bicep curls, hammer curls, pretty much everything I could do with a single Dumbbell until failure and did press-ups to end the workout. This went of for only a few weeks until I bought some resistance bands and smaller dumbbells to do laterals. I continued this workout every other day whilst still eating well until gyms opened up again in August. I’ve never actually been into a gym to workout before so all the machines were alien to me, I did some research and found a full-body workout plan that I have decided to follow and am still following now.

WORKOUT A -
Squat - 60kg
Bench - 50kg
Barbell Row - 40kg
Overhead Press - 30kg
Skull Crushers - 10kg 
Barbell Curl - 30kg
Lateral Dumbell Raises - 6kg

WORKOUT B -
Deadlift - 60kg
Lat Pulldowns - 55
Incline Dumbell Bench - 16kg
Dumbell Row - 20kg
Tricep Pushdowns -
Seated Dumbell Curls - 14kg
Facepulls - 

The workout alternates between A and B every other day.

I’m incredibly pleased with the result and having close family and friends compliment you just motivates me even more. Even though gyms are closed again (January 2021) I still do home workouts this time with more than one dumbbell :).

1,"So I try to gain weight. I know ideally it is nice to have a meal/shake before working out and then after. 

However, my stomach is smol. I don't even attempt to eat before working out. But I did try to drink a cup of shake. Waited like 20-30 mins and then worked out. Felt nauseous afterwards. Then I tried to just drink water and no shake before working out. When the workout ends, I feel so exhausted that I feel nauseous and no appetite to drink shakes or eat. Hmmm :l 

Any ideas? 

Note, I do have gastric problems. And also I am VERY sensitive to smells and flavors and especially when I feel exhausted and nauseated- I don't want anything, just plain water. 

I suspect the exhaustion makes me nauseated. But how to avoid feeling this way? Besides I don't even workout as in holy shit type of workout- just glutes and beginner back muscles exercise that is very simple (but I believe effective in time). I feel like I lack stamina?

A couple more current ones of back and legs.

https://i.imgur.com/5vHfNHL.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/Ix89CRo.jpg

Overview: Like many here I had always been very skinny, and while I generally did a lot of physical activities (running, hiking, etc.) I had never lifted before late Jan 2019. At that point though I decided to start lifting. My starting weight was about 118 lbs and I am currently at 142 lbs though I have been a little higher at times during 2020. I got a barbell rack in 2019 which helped a lot maintaining lifting through the virus.

Routine: From Jan 2019 - Nov 2019 I did stronglifts 5x5. While some say it isn't a super balanced program, I thought it was good to be able to focus on the core barbell lifts for a while. In Nov 2019 I switched to Reddit PPL which I have been doing up to the present. Any machine-related exercises in Reddit PPL I substituted with some sort of dumbbell exercise.

Diet: I did not generally track calories other than occasionally to see how I was doing. Most common foods were the normal oatmeal, protein powder, whole milk, chicken, rice, peanut butter. I most likely would have made more progress if I had tracked more often.

Current lifts: I haven't tested 1 RM but these are my current working weights (I don't know exactly where each started in 2019 but much lower):
-Deadlift 1x5 300# 
-Squat 3x5 235#
-Barbell Row: 5x5 155#
-BP: 5x5 150#
-OHP: 5x5 85#

Is this normal/ what to expect from a calorie shake or not? Please share some tips on how to get the oats as thin as possible.


Edit... just in case someone reads this in a year and wants the best comments:

- grind the oats separately and then add the ingredients
- put the oats and milk or water together and let them sog up and then when you add the ingredients to a blender it will blend easier.
- use a coffee grinder for the oats
- buy powdered oats",How do you grind your oats to make them drinkable,"How do you grind your oats to make them drinkable I tried 1/2 cup oats and 1 cup of milk (+ whey and some peanut butter) and then blended in a nutribullet... the shake was so thick and grainy from the oats.

1,"Hi guys,

For a little bit of background, I am 21m
172cm (5'7)
70kg (154 lbs)

I have been physiqually active almost throughout my whole life. I have been doing rock climbing, crossfit, runnining, cycling and gymnastics and other sports at some point of my life. I have always been around 65kg (143lbs) but never actually looked skinny. In fact since I am short, I was looking rather fine. I never bothered to gain weight because I was already feeling in a great shape and being Light helps for climbing. I could always do 20 pull ups, run 10km, do 50 push ups at any point.

Then, 2 years ago I had to start a night shift job and it all went away. I was eating like shit, feeling like shit all the time, was not working out, ordering pizza, barely doing something active on my days off. At some point, my weight was 90kg (198lbs). It was not only 90kg, but 90kg of pure fat ! So when October came I got my shit together and décided to do a hardcore version of sober October. I cut off sugar in ANY form, bread (and all bread-like stuff) and alcohol. I also started running occasionally about 2, 3 or 5 km and doing some push ups, bodyweight squats etc. and Now I am back to 70kg and I am maintaining this weight for the last 1 month. it feels great! I am starting to get my old form one step at the time. The thing is, I would like to gain some weight. My mental goal is 80kg (176lbs) but what I am afraid of is that by gaining it, I will eventually lose my explosivness, agility, endurance.

So yes, I know that this is not easy at all but would you please give me your two cents on how do u think I could gain weight, improve my explosivness and endurance at the same time?

I don't have a lot of photos of myself. This is one from yesterday. It's not very seeable. It was taken on 7 degrees water bath but you can get a vague idea. Haha

1,"I hope something like this is appropriate for this sub. I'm not super strong  but I think my experience was unique enough to warrant a post.

**Background**

I was recently reunited with my weights after a 3 month hiatus where I did very little exercise and no weights.

I was inspired to run the program because of [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/jnz7zu/locked_down_only_have_a_barbell_and_limited_time/) write up by /u/mythicalstrength. His posts are honestly all gold but this one just really pushed me to try.

I followed the program as best I could with the equipment I had. I don't have plates below 5kg/11lbs, I don't have a squat rack, my only bar is a 5ft axle, and I train outside. This being in Ireland, that usually means pissing rain. But I think I stuck pretty closely to the base program and I even did pullovers!

Because I don't have the smaller plates I figured I would start at 20 and add reps every session. If I got 30 I would increase weight.

**The Program**

I won't explain the whole 6 week program, if you're interested I would buy the book. It's cheap, entertaining, and pretty convincing. I got my copy [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005)

I ran it in an A/B format. On Day A I did Behind the Neck Press, Zerchers, Pullovers, and Pullups. On Day B I did Dips, Zerchers, Pullovers, and High Pulls. I needed to get good at cleans to press anything which is why I did the high pulls.

I also did curls twice.

**Results**

   | Metric Before| Metric After| Imperial Before| Imperial After
---|---|----|----|----
**BW**| 86kg| 93kg| 190lbs| 205lbs
**Zerchers**| 60kgx8| 70kgx25 | 132lbsx8| 155lbsx25
**BtN Press**| ???| 50kgx3x8| ???| 110lbsx3x8
**Dips**| 86kg+10kgx6| 93kg+20kgx12| 190lbs+22lbsx6| 205lbs+44lbsx12
**High Pull**| 60kgx5| 70kgx8| 132lbsx5| 155lbsx8

\*Pictures Removed\*

I'm 186cm/6'1.

**Nutrition**

When I started I thought eating would be a total chore, but actually the appetite just really came to me. 

I ate 4 or 5 meals a day, usually eggs for breakfast, bacon or beef for lunches, dinner was whatever. I would say 95% of those meals involved me cooking something rather than just eating out of a packet. I was very conscious of getting enough vegetables into my diet. If you're eating more fats and protein you need to eat more fibre too. Usually I threw in a few vegetables with the meat and then had salad with the meal. I drank a lot of milk everyday but definitely not a gallon. I had maybe one beer a week.

**What's next?**

This program really taught me to work hard.  The first session, where I took what was a very hard weight for eight and somehow did 20 felt like it was the hardest thing I'd ever done up until that point. Then I did the next session. I was never entirely sure if I could add that extra rep until I did it. Adding weight was basically a relief because it meant I was back down to 20 reps.

I definitely couldn't run anymore of this program though. My quads, calves, upper back and erectors are basically always sore, I wasn't able to keep my conditioning up, I've torn through two pairs of jeans, and I had a small touch of hip pain in the last week. This is definitely not a program you run year round.

That said, I'm pretty happy with my results.

1,"Hi guys. I am 19 years old and I'm a bit tired about my situation with my body. 

I'm 180cm tall and I weigh about 154lbs.  It might seem that I'm pretty skinny, but this is not true at all.

In fact, my arms and my legs are skinny af, while my abdomen is covered by fat. I have already tried, during the last month, to follow a diet aiming to gain some mass, but what I got was just ""swell"" more in the abdominal area, while remaining very thin on the arms, shoulders, chest and legs, altough my workouts were really exhausting.

Surfing the internet, I think I can place myself in the category of **Skinny Fats** , and I have also found out that there is a possible solution to solve this problem: some months of body recomposition.


I had such a structured diet in mind:

my TDEE is about **2100kcal** 

**Workout Days:** 2100+20% = **2520kcal** - 3/4 days/week

**Rest Days:** 2100-20% = **1680kcal** - 3/4 days/week

With the macros divided as follows:

Protein: **160g**

Fat: **60g** (40g unsatured, 20g satured)

Carbs: **334g** Workout Days, **125g** Rest Days

Water: **2,5L/3L /day**

All this will be accompanied by free body workouts (unfortunately we are in Italy and we will be in quarantine for a while longer) whose main exercises will be:

Pectoral: pushups, raised leg pushups and some other variations

Dorsal: Chin-ups back and forth

Biceps: Curl with fitness bands or with something else

Shoulders: Front lifts with fitness bands

Hamstrings: deadlifts

Quadriceps: squats

Abdomen: crunch, reverse crunch and something else

What do you think? Do you have any advice to give me about workouts and, mostly, about diet?

[If you're curious, here's my 1 year post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/hy90on/m20510_1_year_of_gaining_115lbs_to_138lbs_23_lbs/)    
    
**Background Info**    
For my European/metric friends, I am 1.78 meters and went from 52kg to 68kg in a year (+16kg). Did not grow in height, maybe this will be the year?    
    
**Diet**    
I eat intuitively and whatever I want, in moderation. Lately, I like pasta and Cheerios. I don't track calories, but eat consistently the same foods. If I had to guess, 2500 calories for the first 6 months, then 3000 calories from months 6 to 12. Right now is slightly more but again, I don't track so I wouldn't know the exact numbers. Consistency is what matters.    
    
**Routine**    
Did [Reddit's bodyweightfitness routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) for 6 months, then switched to [Reddit's PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) for 1 year.    
    
**Lifts**    
Started with the bar (45 lbs) for everything. After 6 months in the gym, I could bench and squat 135 lbs for 8 reps. Deadlift was 185 lbs for 5 reps.    
Now, I can bench 135 lbs for 15 reps, and squat 165 for 8 reps. Switched out traditional deadlifts for RDLs, slow and controlled at 155 lbs for 15 reps.     
   
**Things that have changed**    
Clothes fit better.

**Background Info**    
For my European/metric friends, I am 1.78 meters and went from 52kg to 68kg in a year (+16kg). Did not grow in height, maybe this will be the year?    
    
**Diet**    
I eat intuitively and whatever I want, in moderation. Lately, I like pasta and Cheerios. I don't track calories, but eat consistently the same foods. If I had to guess, 2500 calories for the first 6 months, then 3000 calories from months 6 to 12. Right now is slightly more but again, I don't track so I wouldn't know the exact numbers. Consistency is what matters.    
    
**Routine**    
Did [Reddit's bodyweightfitness routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) for 6 months, then switched to [Reddit's PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) for 1 year.    
    
**Lifts**    
Started with the bar (45 lbs) for everything. After 6 months in the gym, I could bench and squat 135 lbs for 8 reps. Deadlift was 185 lbs for 5 reps.    
Now, I can bench 135 lbs for 15 reps, and squat 165 for 8 reps. Switched out traditional deadlifts for RDLs, slow and controlled at 155 lbs for 15 reps.     
   
**Things that have changed**    
Clothes fit better.

1,"Hey all,

I'm here with another progress picture from my lean bulk. I'm officially done with month 6, and I'm super happy with my progress. Really, I'm ecstatic with my progress. 

[From June 15th of 2019 to Yesterday (Dec 31st)](https://imgur.com/gallery/4mhuIML)

I've been doing a lean bulk at 250kcal over my maintenance. Obviously some days, I'll eat more, but by and large, I don't go over 300 over. It's been really nice to feel like I'm getting stronger without gaining too much body fat.

[6 month bulking progress](https://imgur.com/a/rlCYlmk)

Though, I am starting to see my lifts stall out a little. On Friday of last week, I wasn't able to finish my 5th set of squats, and only got 2 into it, before I went down. So, yesterday, I deloaded by 10lbs, banged out a full set without any issue. So, Monday, I'll hit it again back at my normal weight.

My issue is I think I'm not eating enough. Weightwise, I'm going up how I want, but I'm learning more and more that I should be eating for proper recovery and to see my lifts go up... not just to gain muscle. 

So, I'll be increasing my intake by another 250kcal to 500 over maintenance and see how I feel. It'll only be for another 2 months, but I have the feeling that the extra food will go a long way to help out my growth. I wanna hit that 1000lb club.

Current PRs aren't super, but I'm happy since just starting in July. 

Bench - ~180lb

Squat - ~285lb

Deadlift - ~405lb

At the moment, my program is based purely on hypertrophy with my squat and DL being in strength ""ranges"" for sets.

I'm really happy with my progress, and I am getting more and more enjoyment out of lifting and getting stronger. Though... shirts are becoming an issue.

1,"Hey guys,

I've been working on my bench press for quite some time now and I'm glad to say that I finally hit 225. I'll outline the process in detail below (video posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG-pPjLWnrQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR037jpPy-n8ypo3RVuYN0SBd8IhhqWOD2mwPzS-St9dY9Bvo179D8G3BQM)).

**Story**

I've been working out on and off since I was 16-17. Usually when school gets busy I take some extended time off, which of course kills a lot of my gains. Fast forward to 19 and I'm in decent shape, but my strength isn't great. So I set out to increase my bench. I started out at around 145, and my process to make gains would be to do 1 rep at each weight in an effort to eventually weigh up each time. Of course this goes against what every experienced lifter will tell you to do, but I found that it worked quite well for me when I was starting out. I would fail multiple days in a row (usually getting increasingly close to making the lift), which would culminate in me finally benching 10lbs more than the previous time, and for roughly 4 months, I rode this all the way to 205lbs. However, I found that that was my breaking point with this flawed training method. Predictably, my shoulders were also very sore, which coincided with school getting more busy. So, I took a 3 month break until September of this year.

When I started again, I had pretty much lost all the progress I made from the months prior, so I could only do 155. I knew that my former workout strategy would wear thin when I got to higher weights, so I decided to change things up a bit and adopt a real routine.

**Routine**

Now, since I started again 3 months ago, I have been doing a program where I do:

\-Workout 1: 80% of my 1RM for 5x5  
\-Workout 2: 85% of my 1RM for 4x4  
\-Workout 3: 90% of my 1RM for 3x3  
\-Workout 4: 95% of my 1RM for 2x2  
\-Workout 5: 100% of my 1RM for 1x1

Within each workout, I start out with 5 pull-ups to warm myself up, 5 reps of 45lbs and 95lbs, then 1 rep of each weight until I get to the weight I'll be working with that day.

I did this every 2 days without exercising in between in order to maintain recovery. The key -- for me at least -- was to be consistent and not skip any workouts because even 1 missed workout would kill my momentum.

**Diet**

I've been keeping a rather consistent diet for the past 4 months. It's a variation of the vertical diet and every meal consists of:

\-Pasta/White rice  
\-Beef/Chicken  
\-1 cup of orange juice

Before workouts, I have a cup of beet juice and a scoop of honey.

During workouts, I have a cup of orange juice with a scoop of BCAAs.

After workouts, I have a cup of orange juice with a scoop of creatine.

Yes, a lot of orange juice.

**Other Lifts**

My chiropractor advised me not to lift heavy for back squats and deadlifts because I have scoliosis, so I'm playing it safe on that front and just trying to do light weights.

Aside from that, I like to do pull-ups, standing shoulder presses, seated shoulder presses, standing flyes, squats and calf raises. I don't specifically work on core very much because I feel it gets activated in many of the movements I do.

**Future Goals**

The primary reason I've been working out is to increase my strength in other sports such as baseball and football, so I plan to add some weight and try to ride this out as long as I can (hopefully weighing something like 160 and benching 275), then I'll work to maintain that and focus on staying in shape.

If anyone would like to critique my form I'd greatly appreciate that because I feel it's still far from perfect. I also notice that when I really push myself my right arm lags a bit from my left arm (even though I'm right-handed) so if anyone has any tips for that I'd love to hear some!

I've been working on my bench press for quite some time now and I'm glad to say that I finally hit 225. I'll outline the process in detail below (video posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG-pPjLWnrQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR037jpPy-n8ypo3RVuYN0SBd8IhhqWOD2mwPzS-St9dY9Bvo179D8G3BQM)).

**Story**

I've been working out on and off since I was 16-17. Usually when school gets busy I take some extended time off, which of course kills a lot of my gains. Fast forward to 19 and I'm in decent shape, but my strength isn't great. So I set out to increase my bench. I started out at around 145, and my process to make gains would be to do 1 rep at each weight in an effort to eventually weigh up each time. Of course this goes against what every experienced lifter will tell you to do, but I found that it worked quite well for me when I was starting out. I would fail multiple days in a row (usually getting increasingly close to making the lift), which would culminate in me finally benching 10lbs more than the previous time, and for roughly 4 months, I rode this all the way to 205lbs. However, I found that that was my breaking point with this flawed training method. Predictably, my shoulders were also very sore, which coincided with school getting more busy. So, I took a 3 month break until September of this year.

When I started again, I had pretty much lost all the progress I made from the months prior, so I could only do 155. I knew that my former workout strategy would wear thin when I got to higher weights, so I decided to change things up a bit and adopt a real routine.

**Routine**

Now, since I started again 3 months ago, I have been doing a program where I do:

\-Workout 1: 80% of my 1RM for 5x5  
\-Workout 2: 85% of my 1RM for 4x4  
\-Workout 3: 90% of my 1RM for 3x3  
\-Workout 4: 95% of my 1RM for 2x2  
\-Workout 5: 100% of my 1RM for 1x1

Within each workout, I start out with 5 pull-ups to warm myself up, 5 reps of 45lbs and 95lbs, then 1 rep of each weight until I get to the weight I'll be working with that day.

I did this every 2 days without exercising in between in order to maintain recovery. The key -- for me at least -- was to be consistent and not skip any workouts because even 1 missed workout would kill my momentum.

**Diet**

I've been keeping a rather consistent diet for the past 4 months. It's a variation of the vertical diet and every meal consists of:

\-Pasta/White rice  
\-Beef/Chicken  
\-1 cup of orange juice  
\-1 cup of almond butter

1,"https://oatsandwheytoday.blogspot.com/2020/12/a-tale-of-two-lifters-bulky-bob-gaining.html

**Lifter 'A', let's call him Bob.** Bob wants to ""bulk"" to build muscle quickly. Bob is probably already too high in fat to begin a massing phase, but he heard about ""newb gains"" in the first year of lifting, so Bob dives in with reckless abandon. He signs up at a local gym, eager to get jacked.

Bob starts with an incorrect TDEE estimation he thinks he can trust, since it came from a TDEE ""calculator"". But it's only an estimate based off of self-reporting of activity level. Bob fancies himself as far more active than he is, though in actuality he will be adding only 3 or 4 days of gym stuff to his otherwise sedentary life. Bob avoids cardio &amp; conditioning work altogether, because he heard it will make building muscle harder. He only wants to do enough lifting to grow, and nothing more. Bob is lucky if he follows any program at all...

What Bob does for the first 6 months is not a proper program, it's just a routine; it's just a list of exercises, and some of them he doesn't bother with. He does the same 3 sets of 10 for a couple lifts, mostly arms; and he doesn't squat at all because he thinks his legs are large enough. His leg size is mostly due to fat, though. Or maybe he squats once or twice per month. Because he wants extra definition. But hitting legs sucks, and is demotivating. He adds a little weight to the bar now and then.

Bob does some flat bench, some light overhead dumbbell work, plenty of bicep curls of course, cable-flyes etc., but no real pulling to speak of. Yes, he does some lat pull-downs, because bodybuilders do them. But Bob cannot do a single pull-up, because he's ""training for size, not strength"", whatever that means. He certainly doesn't deadlift, because Bob heard horror stories about shattered backs &amp; slipped discs. Besides, he doesn't really see the point. Bob is mostly preoccupied with his one-rep max for bench. But he also misses days here and there, worried that he shouldn't train while sore; or let's be honest, he just didn't feel like it.

Bob started out roughly counting calories for a month, but this turned into estimates, and soon gave way to just eating anything and everything he wanted. ""It doesn't matter, I'm bulking!"". If a pound per week is normal, 5 or 6 per month should be okay, maybe even better? He surely doesn't wanna waste those ""newb gains"" he heard about. Bob eats pizza, burgers, anything, everything, but he always remembers to drink a scoop of whey twice per day. Protein will make this happen! He wants to make the most of this Dreamer bulk he's on, and he plugs away at the same minimalist program month after month. Maybe half-way through the year he finally tries to follow an odd program he found somewhere, but Bob doesn't really push himself.

To be fair, Bob did see some real progress in the first month or two, since he was using some of these muscles for the first time. They responded with a little growth, because new lifters will respond to anything. He looked &amp; felt even bigger in the third month, since everything was definitely ""bigger"". He was holding more water overall, but then fat cells started filling up too. Bob kind of fucks around in the gym for about 60 minutes, when his workout routine would take anyone else only 30 minutes to complete, between all his mirror-posing and trips to the water fountain. He is good at tying up equipment.

Bob weighs himself only once every two weeks or so. Six months go by. Eight months. Bob feels huge, and he is. Oh, Bob does not train abs because ""you can't see them, anyways!"" Bob did not even start his bulk with abs, so he had no ""abs"" to lose. He knows ""some"" of the mass in his midsection is fat. Or is it? Is it food? Yes, it is also food, some of it from the day before. But Bob is stoked because of all the ""sick gains"" he's making. He knows he should ""cut"" as some point, to get shredded and reveal all the muscle he thinks he has built. But he still wants to make the most of this first bulk...

A year goes by. Bob has gained 50 pounds; five of them were water, ten pounds (at most) were muscle. Bob has 35 more pounds of fat now. Bob has fucked up his bulk. He is bummed and blames his ""bad genetics"".



**Lifter 'B', let's call him ""Greg"".** Greg also wants to start lifting, and build muscle. He will likewise dedicate his first year of lifting to this task of bulking. Greg has read a little more beforehand, on such topics as training and diet, so he enters this thing a bit more knowledgeable. He has found a good free program online, and he rearranges a few things in his schedule to accommodate lifting 6 days per week.

Yes, he's a full-time student, and also has a part-time job. But he's always been enthralled by a well-developed physique, so he will prioritize this. Sure, some things are on hold. He still has a good social life. Greg wakes up early to lift first thing in the morning. He is fortunate to join a gym that's only a 12-minute bike ride from his home. He eats a snack in transit, squeezes in a full session at the gym in only 43 minutes, rides back, showers, and drinks a meal-replacement shake. Then he properly begins his day.

He'd prefer to not lift so early, but that's what works for Greg at this time. He is mindful to follow his program, increasing weight when prescribed. He hits a different main lift each day in the gym, followed by a supplemental variation of the main lift, and then several accessory movements including opposite muscle groups and some isolation work. Greg is able to super-set the last 3 exercises in the interest of time. In all, it's compact &amp; well-structured. It works well!

All his compound lifts are going up, and he is visibly more muscular after only four months. He started on a decent introductory program which worked well enough, then Greg found a better program with more volume and a greater focus on certain body parts, and greater frequency for his favorite lifts. He was better prepared when he switched to it, since he'd built a base of strength first. He even looks forward to squatting &amp; deadlifting!

How does Greg eat? For the first 2 months he ate only slightly more food, because he was clearly hungrier from the additional effort. But he wanted to get a good baseline approximation of his personal calorie intake, since he was still learning to track calories accurately. Greg invested in a food scale, and a small amount of containers with lids; he settled on 3 or 4 different meals he didn't mind eating regularly. This was in addition to his post-training meal-shakes, and several snacks. He made a point of eating more protein overall, mindful to include green veggies, and healthful fats. Carbs made it easier to hit his calorie targets.

After ironing out the kinks of cooking, meal-prep, and bringing a cooler with food to re-heat while at work etc, Greg also arrived at a good figure for how many calories he now burned in an average day, in response to the amount of activity he now performed. It was only then that he decided to eat in a clear calorie surplus. He settled on +350 calories more than he burned, with the goal of gaining roughly 3 pounds per month.

Greg quickly weighed himself each morning after the bathroom, and recorded the number. This only took him 20 seconds. He would find his average weight each week, to track his rate of change over time. And although he bicycles to the gym in the morning (and to work!), he also added a brisk 1/2 hour walk twice per week, in the interest of minimizing fat gain while bulking. Around 6 or 7 months in, Greg started getting sincere compliments from extended family members (not just, ""my, how you've grown!"", but, ""Wow Greg, you're starting to look jacked!""). Classmates also responded with more attention, and he began to exude confidence.

Every couple of months, he would need to adjust calories slightly, to maintain the same gain over time. He makes it to the end of a year of consistent lifting &amp; disciplined eating. How was Greg's bulk? His scale weight went up a solid 30 pounds! Yes, he probably added 10-12 pounds of fat, but the rest was all lean body mass. And since he started out lean, he still had good definition in his stomach. Abs slightly blurrier, but still there. His arms were more vascular. Greg even had some striations in his chest and shoulders. In all, it was a very reasonable massing phase.

At this point, Greg chooses to cut for 10-12 weeks, in order to trim some of the fluff away. He wants to realize a little more muscular definition before bulking again, yet at a slightly slower rate this time. Bob, however, has not yet started his cut, because he's afraid to ""catabolize"" his hard-earned ""muscle"". Bob is currently an outspoken member of NattyOrJuice, shouting down pictures of guys such as Greg, claiming his physique can't possibly be attained by a natural drug-free lifter in such a short period of time...

1," I've been working out for several years. In the beginning I just went to the gym without really having a clue. The last 2 years I've been doing dumbell workouts at home. I'm quite happy with my physique so far.

It's only very recently that I've been trying to get a bit more in-depth info about working out (ofc. I knew the basics by now). Youtube channels such as Athlean x had me trying out more isolated and more intense workouts (the sore in 6 minutes series). I was amazed at how tight my biceps felt after completing such a workout, I saw veins on my bicep and forearm that I never saw before and I'm sure that I will feel the workout tomorrow, which hasn't really been the case with biceps before that.

So my question is: have I been wasting time with not doing these types of workouts before? I used to do biceps and triceps in the same session, a set of biceps, then triceps, with plenty of rest between. Any feedback/advice is welcome!

1,"Hey everybody.

I've been doing the J&amp;T 2.0 program for 9 months now. I modified it quite a lot, honestly, since I lift at home.

I noticed that while I got bigger, my strength hasn't gone up at all, in particular my bench press. 

&amp;#x200B;

My upper body/chest day is the following:

**Bench press:** 3 sets of X number of reps (depends on the week, but X ranges between 1 and 6, decreasing the rep and increasing the weight week by week).

**Close grip bench:** 4 sets of X number of reps (as above, but higher reps, X starts at 10 and decreases week by week)

**Incline Bench:** 3MRS (reps range from 15 to 6)

**Dips**: 3x3-5 (heavy low-reps) 

&amp;#x200B;

Then some accessory work such as skullcrushers, shrugs etc. 

I read around that when you follow such programs that are hypertrophy focused and you ALSO add more stuff, then it's obvious that you are not going to gain strength.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought of switching to more basic programs such as 5-3-1, but since I've been doing this much volume for like a year I'm afraid of backing off the volume just to gain more strength...won't that make me lose muscle?

1,"Alllrighty, here we are - two years since I started lifting consistently. This is, once again, going to be a fairly long and detailed post. [Here](https://imgur.com/IUr03Gb) is a side by side. Before and After.

Before reading this post. Please consider reading my six and twelve month progress posts before continuing.

# January 2020 - December 2020 : Set Backs

Like most,  had a major impact on my progress this year. I took a break from lifting. March 13th to June 20th, roughly three months. At the start of lockdown I weighed about 156lbs. Come June 20th, my first day back to the gym, I weighed roughly 141lbs. A majority of my weight loss was from muscle. I did lose some fat as well. During that time, I still ate fairly healthy, just a lot less.

**OCD - Medication**

About a year ago, I was clinically diagnosed with OCD. Along with therapy, I was prescribed Paxil. I never took the advice of my physiatrist, mainly due to the side effects of the Paxil and not wanting to spend the money for therapy sessions. Anyway, lockdown plus some other personal issues were extremely hard on me mentally. I felt like I was going insane. So I decided to give the Paxil another shot. I started taking the medication around September - and boy was it rough. The initial side effects took about a month to go away. The first two weeks were brutal - I could not eat. I could not focus. My mind would space out constantly. I felt sick to my stomach every single day. But I still tried my hardest in the gym.

**Injuries**

Thankfully, I have not had many injuries. Barely any in fact. I really only have issues with my right arm. I dislocated my arm and have had tennis elbow a few times. I never stopped lifting during these injuries. Just tweaked my workouts, stretched the injured areas, and took turmeric.

The EASIEST way to prevent any kind of injury is to know your form and know your limits. Form is so critical. Learn it for all the major lifts. Learn what muscles are worked through each phase of the lift. Learn the mechanics. Learn. Proper. Form. I promise you, if you take the time, you will lift more weight efficiently and sustainably.

*Form Resources*

[Stronglifts](https://stronglifts.com/exercises/)

[Alan Thrall](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlanThrall/playlists) (He has playlists for each major lift with lots of good information in them)

The reason why I mention these set backs is to show how that progress is not going to be perfect. As long as you clock in, try your best, and clock out. You will make progress. Whether you are going through physical or mental challenges, get in there and put in your hours. That is as long as you are eating properly.

Programming

I started my first program eight weeks ago. [Powerbuilding II](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/shop/training-templates/powerbuilding-ii-template/) by Barbell Medicine. Since this is a paid program I'm not gonna go into too much detail about program specifics. Its fairly simple program consisting of four lifting days and two cardio type days with one day off. Ill give y'all an example of one of my workout for this week.

**Lifting Day 1**

Squat with belt :

***1 rep @ RPE 8***

***5 reps @ RPE 9***

***5 reps @ RPE 8 (-5%) Repeat until RPE 9 again (cap at 2 sets)***

Incline Bench:

***8 reps @ RPE 7***

***8 reps @ RPE 8***

***8 reps @ RPE 9***

***8 reps @ RPE 8 (-5%) Repeat until RPE 9 again (cap at 2 sets)***

Split Squats :

***10*** ***reps @ RPE 6***

***10 reps @ RPE 7***

***10 reps @ RPE 8***

***10 reps @ RPE 8***

Supplemental Work : Bicycle Squats (program has leg extensions)

***3x 12 reps @ RPE 8***

I definitely like this program. Its simple and doesn't need a lot of equipment to complete. Since I workout at home now it works well for me. I have seen a decent amount of progress in main lifts. Reminder I am just starting week 8 of this 10 week program.

Before - **Squat -** *290lbs;* **Bench -** *215lbs;* **Deadlift -** 365lbs conventional of course **Total -** *870lbs*

After - **Squat -** *325lbs;* **Bench -** *235lbs;* **Deadlift -** *400*lbs conventional of course **Total -** *960lbs*

Almost a 100 pound difference in 8 weeks. Pretty neat.

Two Year Reflection

This is the longest that I have ever stuck to something, consistently. I know that I have made a ton a progress since I started. I love lifting and don't think I will ever stop. At least I hope not. I feel a sense of relief when I am lifting. Just put on some suicideboys and pick up some heavy shit. Sort of an emotional outlet, I guess. I have learned a lot and its crazy to think back at the knowledge I had when I started. I still feel like I learn something new every week. With a lot still to learn. I would consider myself an intermediate lifter at this point.

My goals have certainly changed since I started. I remember I first started lifting to get chicks. Feels cringey now. At this point I could give a shit about how I look. I just want to be strong. I have realized that I have to do stuff for myself. Lifting is something I do for myself.

Plan Moving Forward

After I finish this current program, I plan on running this program again. I like the simplicity of the program and believe I have made decent progress so far. Sooo close to the 1000 pound club. My goal for 2020 was to hit that mark. Without  I would have made it. Oh well. After that I don't know what my goals are gonna be. Maybe I'll learn Olympic lifts after I finish the second round of the program.

Conclusion

Well, that is two whole years in the books. If anyone has a questions feel free to ask. It's been fun.

I have learned a lot and its crazy to think back at the knowledge I had when I started. I still feel like I learn something new every week. With a lot still to learn. I would consider myself an intermediate lifter at this point.

My goals have certainly changed since I started. I remember I first started lifting to get chicks. Feels cringey now. At this point I could give a shit about how I look. I just want to be strong. I have realized that I have to do stuff for myself. Lifting is something I do for myself.

Plan Moving Forward

After I finish this current program, I plan on running this program again. I like the simplicity of the program and believe I have made decent progress so far. Sooo close to the 1000 pound club. My goal for 2020 was to hit that mark. Without  I would have made it. Oh well. After that I don't know what my goals are gonna be. Maybe I'll learn Olympic lifts after I finish the second round of the program.

Conclusion

Well, that is two whole years in the books. If anyone has a questions feel free to ask. It's been fun. If you are looking to build a home gym and cannot find equipment, check out [r/homegym](https://www.reddit.com/r/homegym/). Thanks for reading, I hope you all like these kinds of progress posts. I'll probably make another one in a year.

Peace out, dawgs."
1,"Hi all, i've been dieting since September as i said i'd lose some weight first before i started, i'm now at the point where i want to join the gym and improve my physique and gain muscle, however i'm not fully done my diet, i still have more weight to lose so therefore i'm still in a caloric deficit. Would attempting to build muscle be pointless in caloric deficit? i have a friend who goes to the gym daily and says there won't be much results because i'm just eating around 1600 calories daily. i should also mention i'm 18, 6'0 150lbs. Will i see improvement in my physique/ body and notice muscle mass training in a caloric deficit? my body type at the moment would probably be what you call ''Slim fat'' i look relatively normal or maybe slightly overweight in clothing, but when undressed you can clearly tell i'm carrying some extra baggage, chest fat, love handle fat, stomach fat, its all still there despite me being relatively light (150lbs) Would joining the gym be the right move at this current time and stage?

1,"Hello everyone, I started working out around 2.5 months ago and I’ve seen quite some progress in terms of changes in my body but now I feel like I’ve hit a plateau. Compared to the first few weeks, I can’t gain anymore weight or lift any heavier compared to previous weeks (I was able to gradually increase the weight I life almost every week)

My height:5”8
Weight: 62-64 Kgs
Bf% unknown 

My current diet and supplements i take:

I start of the day with a cup of tea and 4 whole eggs with the yolk (fried/boiled)

Followed by lunch, which always includes white rice and some form of meat

Then I hit the gym and once I’m back, I have a chicken leg and thigh piece and 1.5 scoops of whey protein.(350 calories and 45-50g protein)

For dinner, I’ve rice again and some fort of meat

Supplements: I take muscle tech nitro tech whey with 3G creatine and 5g Bcaa per scoop 

Used to take BCAA and preworkout but have stopped since BCAA comes with my current protein and preworkout simply didn’t work for me 

My questions are:
1. Should I start eating more? If so, what should I eat and how much? Ps: I live in india

2. Does masturbation affect your body or your ability to develop muscles or lift weight in any way? It’s kind of an addiction for me. I’ve been trying to abstain but it’s really really hard 

3. I’m fairly lean but have accumulated Some fat on my belly etc due to the amount of junk I had during the lockdown, basically I can see outerlining of the abs under good lighting. Should I start doing cardio as well or should I just focus on bulking? 

Any help is appreciated","New to working out, need some help!","New to working out, need some help!

1,"Hey guys,

I was just wondering if anyone had tried a very high protein diet and if that yielded better results when bulking in terms of muscle vs fat.

This is because there is at least one or two studies that suggest that overeating on protein may not lead to excess fat gain, which I guess could make bulking cleaner if you hit a certain minimum of calories and just added protein to eat in a surplus. I mean this in terms of trying to minimise fat gains not just simply more protein = more muscle.

1,"So I train pretty heavy on my lifts lately and I was just wondering when and how you should plan a deload. For example, for bench press I usually start my program at rpe 7 or 8 for 5 reps and whenever I hit 4 sets of 5 I add 5 lbs to the lift next workout. I’ll do this for like 2-3 months sometimes  until I plateau but after a while my shoulders start hurting and this sometimes leads to minor injury even. It’s not a form issue, it’s just because I’m benching very heavy twice a week and after a while the stress on the muscle adds up. My shoulders are very tight and I have to warm up and stretch them quite a bit pre and post workout to prevent injury. But for the sake of this post I just wanna know how to plan a deload to give your muscles a break and prepare for the next workout plan regardless of the exercise. 

My main goal is to build muscle rather than build strength so maybe I need to adjust the rep range too. So how do I know when to lower the weight and how should I plan my deload. Do I even need to deload if my main goal is to build muscle? Should I just lower the rpe down back down to 7 or 8 and then repeat the program?

SQUAT: 50KG
BENCH: 40KG ish
DL: 60KG
OHP: 28KG

When I began training I didn't actually know what I was doing. I didn't know that there's high bar and low bar squat.
I didn't know that there's very little difference between conventional and sumo deadlift.

I got knee pain, lower back pain, elbow tendonitis
I've just fixed my elbow pain which was all my squat grip and shelf
Lower back pain is much better after training core exclusively and stretching my hip flexors and paying really good attention to form.

Over the year I have watched so much fitness content and most importantly form/technique. Calgary Barbell, Alan Thrall and Greg Doucette has taught me a lot. 

The program I started on were Stronglifts, but the volume were very squat focused and no progression scheme to follow.
After a few weeks I quickly found out that GZCLP would be much better for me. GZCLP teaches you to program on your own while progressing through rep ranges. It revolved around finding your weakpoints and including accessories that support your main lifts for that day.

SQUAT: 130kg
BENCH: 90kg

What have I learned?

Food and sleep is so important. There are days when I get 4 hours of sleep and the gym session goes to shit. Also don't be afraid to eat a little bit unhealthy. Just don't overdo it. Chocolate milk is my favorite. Ez 400 calories.

Form is really important. Protect your back, especially your lower back. Strong core and bracing is key

When I started out my chest and arms grew quite a bit they started filling out some of my shirts and stuff

But I really started tracking in oct.

My weight then was around 165ish

My arms were a little under 12 inches - chest a little under 36 and they eventually grew to those measurements however

I've been tracking. It's now the end of dec and my arms and chest haven't really been growing. Been eating 3k cals a day - and 160-170g of pro. 

I go to the gym 3 times a week. I've been sure to alter reps and volume to work my muscles in new ways and shock them etc. Also have done different exercises just to target the muscle in a new way ( I don't go crazy with that FYI)

Anyways my current weight is roughly 180lbs and I can say I have gotten significantly stronger! But unfortunately my chest and arms won't grow now for some reason.

Do I need to eat more calories or am I being impatient? I have tracked my weight the last 2 weeks and it hasn't gone up at all. (It may have been at this weight for a week or two more as well)

I heard a rule of thumb is about 2lbs of muscle and 2lbs of fat a month but I'm curious since it seems I have stopped growing in my chest/arms.

1,"Hello Once Again Gainers,

**INTRO**

From my time on r/gainit, I've seen many a trainee bemoan being ""skinny-fat"", particularly because they don't know WHAT they should do to address their situation.  If they bulk, they get fatter.  If they cut, they get skinnier.  What are they to do?

I figured I'd share 3 different approaches to address the problem, such that a trainee can pick A way forward and execute it.  A plan, executed violently today, is far better than a superior plan that never gets executed.

Without further ado...

**THE STARTING STRENGTH APPROACH**

This approach is for those that like the idea of beginner and intermediate programs, linear progression, few movements, and low reps.

[Article 1: ""The Skinny Fat Lifter](https://startingstrength.com/training/the-skinny-fat-lifter)

[Article 2: ""The Skinny Fat Lifter 2](https://startingstrength.com/training/the-skinny-fat-lifter-part-2)

KEY POINTS

* If you make your shoulders, traps, chest and upperback wider than your waist, you will no longer appear ""skinny fat"". 

* Growth happens by eating.  Eat to support growth as a new trainee and add some muscle.

* Once your waistline reaches a threshold (say 38-40"") switch to an intermediate program and lose fat until you get your waist under control.  Once you get it under control, go right back to beginner programs and start it over again.  NOTE: Your pants size is NOT your waist size.  Get a measuring tape.

* Focus on driving up your press, chins, pulldowns and deadlift to build up a strong looking upper body.


**2 APPROACHES FROM PAUL CARTER**

This approach is for people that have some meaningful way of measuring their bodyfat.  If the way you measure bodyfat is by taking a random shirtless photo of yourself and posting it online for strangers to take guesses, this is NOT an ideal approach for you.  This is also for trainees that use more variety in their lifting.

[The Article: ""The Bulking and Cutting Handbook""](https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/the-bulking-and-cutting-handbook)

TAKEAWAYS

* ""If you're a total newbie (or have less than a year of really intelligent training experience) and you're more than 18-20% body fat, then you're in luck. No really, you are. Because then you're in that rare period of time where you can lose fat while building a decent amount of muscle at the same time.

**CONCLUSION**

 There you go: 3 approaches.  You can up calories, linearly progress until you can't, switch to weekly progression while you cut calories and start the whole thing over again.  OR you can run a slight calorie deficit and focus on progressing until you no longer can, at which point you'll be leaner and in a position to add calories and chase PRs.  OR you can add calories and chase rep PRs.  It all works!  

Best of luck in your pursuit!",3 Solutions For Skinny-Fat Trainees From Across The Web,"3 Solutions For Skinny-Fat Trainees From Across The Web Hello Once Again Gainers,

**INTRO**

From my time on r/gainit, I've seen many a trainee bemoan being ""skinny-fat"", particularly because they don't know WHAT they should do to address their situation.  If they bulk, they get fatter.  If they cut, they get skinnier.  What are they to do?

I figured I'd share 3 different approaches to address the problem, such that a trainee can pick A way forward and execute it.  A plan, executed violently today, is far better than a superior plan that never gets executed.

Without further ado...

**THE STARTING STRENGTH APPROACH**

This approach is for those that like the idea of beginner and intermediate programs, linear progression, few movements, and low reps.

[Article 1: ""The Skinny Fat Lifter](https://startingstrength.com/training/the-skinny-fat-lifter)

[Article 2: ""The Skinny Fat Lifter 2](https://startingstrength.com/training/the-skinny-fat-lifter-part-2)

KEY POINTS

* If you make your shoulders, traps, chest and upperback wider than your waist, you will no longer appear ""skinny fat"". 

* Growth happens by eating.  Eat to support growth as a new trainee and add some muscle.

* Once your waistline reaches a threshold (say 38-40"") switch to an intermediate program and lose fat until you get your waist under control.  Once you get it under control, go right back to beginner programs and start it over again.  NOTE: Your pants size is NOT your waist size.  Get a measuring tape.

* Focus on driving up your press, chins, pulldowns and deadlift to build up a strong looking upper body.


**2 APPROACHES FROM PAUL CARTER**

This approach is for people that have some meaningful way of measuring their bodyfat.  If the way you measure bodyfat is by taking a random shirtless photo of yourself and posting it online for strangers to take guesses, this is NOT an ideal approach for you.  This is also for trainees that use more variety in their lifting.

[The Article: ""The Bulking and Cutting Handbook""](https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/the-bulking-and-cutting-handbook)

TAKEAWAYS

* ""If you're a total newbie (or have less than a year of really intelligent training experience) and you're more than 18-20% body fat, then you're in luck. No really, you are. Because then you're in that rare period of time where you can lose fat while building a decent amount of muscle at the same time. Get into a minor caloric deficit and focus on banging out rep PR's on the big lifts.""

1,"18M 143 pounds 5’8” on my first lean bulk. Gone from around 2000 to 2600 calories per day over the last month. Over the last week I upped my intake from 2400-2600 and my weight has rapidly increased by around 4-5 pounds over the last 2 days. Most of the added intake has come from solely from carbs. Body fat % has also gone up based on a scale I have and abs are less visible. I’ve also been feeling sluggish. The weird thing is that i’ve noticed greater vascularity even with the higher bodyfat. It’s been pretty tough to eat the full 2600 each day from clean foods - not sure if that means I should cut back. What are some explanations for this? Should I cut back calories a bit to slow weight gain a bit? Also if I wanted to stay leaner is there a way I can cut every few weeks without losing muscle mass?

1,"Hey everyone! I'm still early in my journey but I've learned a lot from this sub and want to give something back so here it goes.

Backstory: 
I'm about 5'6 and fluctuate between 143-147 lbs per month. It was quite a time getting here because I started around 110, skinny! I just want to fit in my t-shirts better :). Even getting here and finding motivation to eat correctly was difficult as I enjoy snacking and in particular, unhealthy snacking. 

 I've kept a list of some substitutes that worked for me and I plan to make these healthier over time. Personally I don't relate to the ""I woke up one day and started eating healthy"" stories, I found habits are a more resilient practice to keep yourself in check.  So I started with improving my grocery list.


Swaps:
Ice cream - get some greek yogurt of your favorite flavor (vanilla with your own toppings is good too) then mix that with some granola and/or berries. High protein dairy that has natural sugars to curb the sweet tooth. The granola gets some good carbs in as well.

Beer - this is a hard one but kombucha. Though not the healthiest of drinks I found that the ""kick back with a beer"" feeling was nicely replaced with one of these. Mio is another great option, I find mostly what I want is something that isn't water when I'm relaxing at the end of the day. The consideration for this is one serving of sugar vs alcohol, lesser of two evils approach. 

Chips - popcorn. Microwavable makes it easier to to avoid the impulses if you have some chips in your pantry. Stovetop is unbeatable though. You can even season the popcorn with the same spices as your favorite chips! Just make sure to get the unbuttered options if you're worried about fats.  Peanut butter pretzels are also great if you're trying to easily boost that protein count. I find downing an extra 20gs of protein is super easy this way. Also chickpeas are straight fire, fairly expensive unfortunately but they carry the same flavors as most chips.

Ground beef - I love ground beef but unfortunately it's not great to have it every day. Consuming large amounts of red meat increases risk of heart disease and I'm trying to run a marathon here, not a sprint. Ground turkey can be dropped in if you find you're eating too much. I've replaced most of my meals with chicken / turkey and ~ 3 days a week have a meal with beef or a red meat. It keeps me looking for to those days and keep on track.



These were the things that I would find myself craving  every night when I'm bored watching Netflix or gaming. Quarantine has made these impulses even worse. The replacements are just a step forward towards a better diet and some I still want to phase out (kombucha).

1,"This subreddit has been invaluable to me and I've learned a lot. I would like input from the community on if a program switch is right for me in the new year.

**My Background:** 

38 years old, 5'9"", male. I've been taking gaining serious for 7 months. Prior to that I lived an entirely sedentary lifestyle. I've gone from 137lb to 164lb, and my bio-scale suggests 13lbs of that weight gain has been muscle. My lifts are up considerably. I've been running a version of the Reddit PPL for the entire 7 months, with focus on major compound lifts (Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Overhead Press, Barbell Rows). I work out 4-5 times per week. I'm still making pretty good linear progress every workout (i.e., adding another rep or weight to each exercise).

**My Headspace:** 

I feel OK about my progress, but not great. My friends and family have made comments about how good I am looking, but when I look in the mirror I mostly just see a filled-out version of skinny-me. I recognize 1.9lb of muscle gain a month is pretty good, but I wonder if my newbie gains couldn't be stretched farther. When I see some of the progress pictures on this subreddit I feel like I must be missing something. So many dudes with similar stats to me wind up looking like f'ing He-Man in a similar timeframe. My primary goal is to look good naked (e.g., hypertrophy).

**My Question(s):** 

Should I switch up my program? Is only hitting each PPL muscle group once+ per week limiting me? My thesis is that switching to something that hits my muscle groups more frequently throughout the week will accelerate my progress. I was considering switching to GZCLP, Starting Strength 5x5 or maybe 5/3/1.

I'd love input from you guys if you think this is a good idea. If so, would you recommend one of the above programs (or some other system) above another?

My biggest worry is that I've spent so much time just obliterating my muscle group on a given PPL day that switching to the comparatively ""light"" intensity of one the above programs won't effectively stress a given muscle group. Is that concern sensible or just in my head? I realize I'll get somewhat similar volume in, but it will be spread over the course of the week rather than in one day.",[Help] Should I switch up my program?,"[Help] Should I switch up my program?

I have always been into sports, played football (soccer) a lot in highschool etc. Found myself a bit out of shape at 22, decided to do something about it.

I done my numbers on the symmetry website and most of my compounds come in at novice level, with only the front squat further than this.

1,"\[Progress\] 21/M/6'3 (147 lb to 204 lb/ 67kg to 92.7kg) \[1 year\]

**Background:**

Been a tall twig my whole life, and decided in November 2019 that this needed to change. I had been dealing with clinical depression for an extended period of time, in and out of hospital and just wasn't happy with myself. Also living in China for a year and people pointing ""so tall and skinny"" all the time did not help! Whilst I was studying in Hong Kong I started casual weightlifting in November 2019, but not eating, decided I enjoyed it so when I returned to the UK December 2019 I decided to get on a PPL programme which I've stuck to ever since, with some adjustments. I have had to deal with 2+ months of lockdown which have eliminated some of the gains I could have made but I made sure to do some bodyweight exercises.

I am dealing with a rotator cuff injury which I picked up at a gym in Seoul back in March as I didn't warm properly (didn't know how to, I've been making this stuff up as I go along), and its bothered me ever since, currently in physio but it meant no benching for at least 3 months and even now I cannot push it without pain (urgh).

**Diet:**

For most of my life I would skip breakfast and go hungry because I saw eating as a waste of time when I could have been studying or doing fun stuff. This changed, I knew I had to eat a lot, how much? I don't know, I just ate anything and everything I could, at one point up to 1kg of chicken breast a day (you could buy 10kg in South Korea for less than $35). I was also drinking ON Gainer. I bought a blender a few months ago and make myself a 2k calorie shake every day, full of whole milk, Greek yoghurt, whey, granola, banana etc.

My BF % is probably too high, I have a bit of a stomach, but at this point I'm going for strength and size so I am not too bothered.

I take creatine powder on and off since May.

**Benefits:**

Feel so much more confident in myself, my rotator cuff hurts almost constantly but I can still workout, and hopefully physio will sort it. I've grown out of many of my clothes and friends are noticing me. gym has been a huge help for my mental health as well.

1,"Gyms are closing tomorrow cause of a lockdown in my country so I decided that I would post a little update on my gain journey.

**Background:**

Since 2013 I was trying to gain weight but never really committed to it. In August 2019 I got a severe concussion which I am still recovering (physically and mentally) from so I decided to take care of my body more and actually commit to gaining weight. From September 2019 till December 2019 I followed Ivysaur's 4-4-8 and gained like 5 kilos. I lost all of it during the lockdown of March 2020 to July 2020. I started again on the 1st of July with Ivysaur 4-4-8. Made decent gains but felt like I could step it up and started the reddit PPL on the 1st of September 2020. I kinda wanted to post a picture after 6 months to motivate others, since I got most motivation from the posts that showed short-term progress as well instead of the ones that took several years.

**Diet:**

I kinda stuck to eating what I normally did as well, but added 3 extra meals. Looks something like this

Breakfast: Cereal with milk

Lunch: Sandwiches

Snack: Cashewnuts (75 gram) with some chocolate

Dinner: Pasta/Curry/Rice/Potatoes/Junk food with quark and kiwi as dessert

Late night snack: 1100 Kcal shake or 500 kcal shake (depends on time and how much I ate during the day)

Total: Somewhere around 3000 kcal a day

Only supplement I use is whey protein powder. Started creatine at the start but got paranoid that I was losing hair so I stopped taking it haha

**Workout:**

As I stated in the background info, I started Ivysaur 4-4-8 on the 1st of July and switched to the reddit PPL in September. Have been running that since and loving it. Weight progress:

Bench: From 5x5 30 kg (66 lbs) to 5x5 50 kg (110 lbs)

OHP: From 5x5 20 kg (44 lbs) to 5x5 32.5 kg (72 lbs)

Deadlift: From 1x5 40 kg (71 lbs) to 1x5 75 kg (165 lbs)

Squat: From 3x5 40 kg (88 lbs) to 3x5 70 kg (154 lbs)

1,"Hello once again Gainers,

I've seen an issue in the discussion of gaining that I feel may need it's own topic.  Often, whenever a trainee here posts that they gained some amount of weight, someone will immediately chime in and explain that this person is gaining too fast based off some metric on how much muscle a person can put on in a fixed amount of time.  I think the currently en vogue statement is that you can only gain 2lbs of muscle in a month, so let's use that for now.

Trainee says ""I gained 6lbs this month"".  Helpful poster Johnny says ""You're gaining too fast!  You can only gain 2lbs of muscle in a month, so that means you gained 4lbs of fat!  Slow down the bulk!""


Folks, there is more to gaining than fat and muscle.  We're talking SCALE weight here.  Lots of things can impact that.  The top 3 (outside of muscle and fat) being glycogen, water and food mass.


**ON GLYCOGEN**

I'm not nearly equipped to discuss the finer details of glycogen, but [here](https://www.t-nation.com/training/question-of-strength-61) is an article discussing the LOSS of glycogen during weight loss and it's impact on the physique.  

&gt;You might FEEL like you're losing muscle. You might look smaller or deflated, but that comes from storing less glycogen and water inside your muscles. Glycogen is how your body stores carbs inside the muscles; it's a combination of glucose (broken down carbs) and water.  If you're cutting calories (and likely carbs) you'll store less glycogen. Why? Because you don't have ""extra energy"" to store since you're pretty much using it all.  If you store less glycogen and water, your muscles become flatter and smaller looking. A muscle with less glycogen/water is like a balloon with less air. That can mess with your mind, but it's not muscle loss.


In turn, when we're reversing the process and GAINING muscle, with it comes fuller stores of glycogen, which will add more weight to the body.  This is ESPECIALLY true during the initial stages of weight gain.  The first month or so one can see dramatic increases in weight, much like how one can drop weight dramatically in the first few weeks of weight loss.  If anyone has ever watched ""The Biggest Loser"", contestant would like 20lbs in the first week, only to lose little or even GAIN some weight in the second week once glycogen was depleted and they were focusing on ""real"" weight loss.

**ON WATER**

Glycogen pulls in water as well, which is another area where scale weight can be impacted.  On top of that, protein is the macronutrient that requires the MOST water to digest.  This is why most survival kits tend to base their nutrition around fats and carbs with only the barest amounts of protein to ensure survival: if you try going carnivore out in the wild with limited water, you're in for a rough time.  It's also why high protein diets can be of concern for people with kidney disorders.  All of that having been said, if you're taking in more water and HOLDING more water, your scale weight is going to be up FROM MORE WATER.  Water is not fat or muscle, but will impact your scale weight.


**ON FOOD MASS**

And then, there is just plain old food mass.  If you're eating more food, more food is going to be in your body when you weigh yourself.  Yes, even if you weigh yourself consistently everyday after a morning bowel movement, no human completely eliminates everything in their intestines, and the trainee making a concentrated effort to gain weight will have more food in their body compared to a trainee losing weight.


**ON ""GETTING FAT""**

All of this is written to say that you cannot just subtract muscle gain from weight gain and arrive at fat gain.  It's more complex than that.  And as [this](https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/oh-go-ahead-and-pig-out) article points out, it takes an honest concentrated effort to put on a significant amount of fat.  Getting big takes time, no matter if it's big fat or big muscle.  No one is going to balloon up in the span of a month.


So what's the takeaway?  Don't let scale weight gains trip you up.  Always remember: food is there to help you recover from TRAINING.  Train hard enough that you NEED more food to recover, then eat that food, recover and grow.",There Is More To Gaining Than Fat And Muscle,"There Is More To Gaining Than Fat And Muscle Hello once again Gainers,

I have been trying to eat about 2600 (plus whatever are burned exercising) calories per day to gain weight. I lift weights every second day, and run or spin bike the days I do not. I don't have a huge appetite, but I have been getting about 1000 calories per day through this smoothie recipe I've devised.

I have gained about 4 pounds in the last couples weeks from drinking these smoothies and beginning to take creatine and I am happy with how my body looks so far. Advice is greatly appreciated."

I just did my first 8 week “bulk” where I upped my calories to about 3,000 per day.  Didn’t really track them, but I’ve been eating more than ever and trying to have snacks in between meals.

In that period I gained about 2 lbs muscle and 3 lbs fat.  Do these numbers sound pretty typical for a good clean bulk?  Or am I too far in the fat, not far enough in the muscle?  What are good number to shoot for in 4 week increments, based on my stats above?  

I feel pretty fat at the 16 pbf. I have 92 lbs of skeletal muscle now, is that any good at all?  I’m about 8 months in to training more seriously and am not sure how my program is going, it’s hard to quantify.

Been training on/off for a couple of decades,  I had been a proponent of the MAX-OT , which is 3 sets per exercise, each 4-7 reps, going to failure on the last rep, or if I hit 7-7-7, increase the poundage.

1,"I’ve been following Jim Stoppani’s 12 week shortcut to Size for the past 74 days and have noticed a big increase in my strength. However, gains haven’t been very noticeable even while eating WAY MORE than I ever have. I don’t hit my 3400 caloric intake mark everyday, but come close more often than not.

I’m 6’2, 190 (Look skinner than I am) and was 185 when the program started, but I still have not seen many visual changes which I know will come with time, but I always feel like I should be doing more. The program is 4 days a week and like I said I only hit each major group once, and sneak in abs and legs on days that aren’t completely focused on them. 

After doing a little research and having conversations with friends, it seems like I should be hitting these muscle groups at least twice a week based on what I’ve been told about an upper/lower split. From what I’ve seen I think it makes more sense. I suppose the program i’m doing tailored more towards beginners or something of that nature. It’s almost complete, but I kind of want to drop it completely and start focusing on an upper/lower split. However, that will be decided on what you all suggest.

1,"Hi all, 

Just wanted to pop in with a little update. The last seven years have been a wild ride. I'm naturally very lean and putting on muscle has been a huge battle. Especially doing it all naturally. I set a goal five years ago to hit 250lbs lean by the time I turned 30. I turn 30 in a week and unfortunately I will come up a few pounds short... BUT that's okay! 

**Pictures** 

[Progress Photos](https://imgur.com/a/8msT6lZ)

I blacked my face out on the early ones because wow... not a great starting look haha. 

**Process and Mistakes** 

Looking back now I can see how many hard lessons I had to learn. I was so desperate to put on weight that I WAY over did it in the first year and got really really fat. Not just fat... skinny fat. 

Believe it or not I weigh the same now (blue shorts photo) as I did in the ""fat"" photo! Talk about a difference in body composition.

I certainly could have made this transformation smarter and faster.... but to be honest, I always tried to keep normal life in mind. I didn't want to let the gym consume my life. I wanted to still enjoy eating and drinking beers with the lads. So it's been something I've embraced as a slow and steady approach and I credit that for making my goals more sustainable and approachable. 

**Core Lifts**

The foundation of everything has pretty much been centered around big compound lifts. My current bests are:

Deadlift: 350lbs x1

Bench Press : 205lbs x2

Overhead Shoulder Press: 135lbs x4

Bentover Row: 155lb x8

**Future Goals**

Being 6'7"" was always something I hated. Now, I am much more comfortable in my own skin. It's taken seven years but I finally feel like I have ""filled out"" my massive frame. 

My next goal is to build on this and spend the next five years building a truly athletic physique. I'm hoping I can hit 270lbs at a lean bf% by the age of 35!

1,"Been working out for 8 weeks now, I've recouped a lot if not most of the former size I cultivated my freshman year of college that I allowed to be recycled back into the temple of brodin.

I've seen 4 inches of growth to my chest, 3 inches to my shoulders, ~1.5 inches to my arms, .75 to my neck and a lot of seemingly unreasonable growth for such a short time span (including a well deserved 1"" of belly fat) on my dreamer bulk for 8 weeks.

However, my forearms have grown perhaps .4 -.45"". In order to bring these numbers up I am starting what I call

**the Dead Hangs Every Day Challenge**

The purpose of this is to introduce a small opportunity every day to get growth on my forearms by doing only dead hangs (which I'm supposed to do after every workout but I'm just too tired/sore/pressed for time).

The goal is a 5 minute window of my day every day to just hang from my home gym's pull up bar, for at least 90 seconds average between sets. As my forearms increase in strength I will attempt to hang for as long as possible up to the 5 minutes as well as stick a dumbell between my feet to increase in intensity every week.


This is a super simple thing to do that even if you don't have a cage rack like me, getting a pullup bar from amazon and just hanging to relieve stress between work is good.

In one week you will have accumulated an extra 35 minute workout that you won't even notice.

1,"I have a goal of 190-195 lbs (200 would be a dream) and am currently sitting at 185. 

Recently I had a PT test that I cut TOO close because I neglected cardio. It was a measly 1.5 mile run. Thought because it was a short distance, I could push it out. I was wrong. 

I’ve since done a 3 day workout PPL with 5 days of running/week. 

It looks like this:

Monday: Push day/ Easy 3 mile run
Tuesday: Sprints
Wednesday: Pull day/ 3 mile run
Thursday: Rest
Friday: Legs/easy 3 mile run
Saturday: Long Distance timed run (1 hour) 
Sunday: Rest

After doing this and getting a Body Scan (1 month total time difference) I’ve actually gained .9 lbs but lost muscle mass in all parts (Arms, Trunk, and Legs). This is also odd considering I’ve kept my caloric intake equal despite the upped cardio. 

I felt like doing this program was a jerk reaction to nearly failing this test. I want to continue to bulk and was wondering everyone’s opinions on the LEAST/most time efficient days per week required to do WELL/BE PROFICIENT on a 1.5-2mile run.

1,"From 2014-2020 I lifted 4-5 days a week consistently and was extremely in shape. My biggest motivator was looking good and being muscular (I know it sounds shallow but I was in college). I was always skinny in high school and after gaining weight I loved/r/ my physique and thought I would never want to change the way I look. Then at the beginning of this year I suddenly stopped going to the gym, no reason why I just stopped. 

I’ve lost 75% of my muscle mass and hate how skinny I look but for some reason I can’t make myself go to the gym as much as I want to. I have a membership, it’s close by, and I have time. It’s like the motivation/discipline for lifting was deleted from my brain. 

And it slowly compounded because now that I’m less in shape I have less energy which makes it even harder to go. 

Has anyone run into a sudden loss of discipline? Does anyone have any advice on bringing the mindset back? My only theory is after “achieving my goal” for so many years it doesn’t bring the same motivational energy. Or maybe a second theory that after college, because my only motivator was looking fit for myself and as part of my social image, I no longer feel the need to try anymore.

Should have taken starting leg pics -.-, but i'm pretty happy with this side by side, very obvious progress when you start out about as thin as you can be. Still underweight, but still gaining.

**The Exercises/Routines**

Started 6 months ago with Phraks GSLP,  my first week lifts were:

Deadlift 1x5@30kg

Squat 3x5@20kg

OHP 3x5@16kg

Bench 3x5@20kg

And these were a huge struggle, the doms left me crippled for week 2.

I spent 3 months on this program before deciding that I might as well go more than 3x a week as I spent my days off itching to go.


After looking for a routine that allowed me to go more times a week I settled on the metallicadpa PPL from /r/fitness wiki. I ran this for 6 weeks and was enjoying it, really started to focus on form for each lifts as I was starting to get more comfortable so my aim was no longer to just do the lift safely, but also to generate as much power as I can with current strength level.

Felt like pushing myself some more and nsuns caught my eye, so I spent from then until now on nsuns (about 6 weeks).

Current best lifts on Nsuns:

[Deadlift 4x87.5kg](http://streamable.com/rbqttg)

Squat 3x72.5kg - Didnt record this but [heres my first time hitting 70kg a couple weeks back](https://streamable.com/xywp2p), night and day comparison to when i [first hit 50kg on 31/7/20](https://streamable.com/ukitpl) and was proud of it til I filmed it and saw my form/depth was shit, dropped it 15kg and worked back up with better form.

OHP 3x42.5kg

Bench 3x52.5kg

Havn't filmed these two as much as my OHP has consistently progressed well and has felt fine so haven't really attempted to analyse my form, and bench is just awkward to film sometimes as only really good spot to put phone is on the other benches which are often occupied.

Bench feels like its lagging a bit, am currently planning on focusing on that heavily now like I have done for squat/deadlift form to figure out where i'm missing power if it's technique or training or what.

**The Future**

Nsuns kicked my ass, which is what I wanted when I chose it, I'm pretty happy with where I am right now and what I got out of it, my current plan is to shift to a submaximal training format for a bit as the forced linear progression on nsuns has made some days daunting (most likely a 5/3/1, probably will start some cycles of 5314B and then i'm considering really going for size and doing the [6 month block laid out here](https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/j5q2ez/6_months_of_eating_and_training_for_mass_laid_out/) by /u/mythicalstrength while taking diet more seriously)

Current measurable goals are a 2x bw squat+deadlift, I'd also love to hit a bodyweight ohp while im reasonably lean, and i'd like to eventually rip an old shirt (but who doesn't?), the rest is just general strength+size increase I don't really have an end goal.

**Diet**

When I started I focused hard on just eating as much as possible, always had struggled with appetite like many others here, I started at the gym between semesters at uni so I had a few weeks break where I could purely focus on eating and working out, and thats what I did. If I could eat more, I did, it was a miserable bloated and nauseated few weeks but it kick started my appetite.

Spent some time counting calories but it really just wasn't for me, I realised if I had to keep so strict on myself I would burn out. The time spent counting gave me a rough idea of how much food I needed to eat to gain and what good recovery/growth felt like, so I just tried to base it on that while tracking my weight daily. If I was hitting my protein count and both my weight and lifts were going up I was happy, at my starting weight the idea of putting on some fat obviously did not scare me at all.

As far as what I ate goes, old me ate twice a day, and one of those meals would be something like instant noodles, with a bit of thought it wasn't too hard to improve. My start was to just swap foods out for better foods and try eat more of them, greek yoghurt instead of noodles, snacking on nuts, making sure I ate when I woke up instead of waiting 6 hours, eating when I COULD rather than when I NEEDED to. Feels like more of a mindset shift than actual diet. Just started to be more conscious of what kind of macros were in different foods and kept them in mind.

Whey protein once a day w/milk, greek yoghurt, nuts, nut bars, proper meal for dinner such as the classic chicken+rice, eating right before going to sleep, maybe a little too much reliance on easy junk calories such as a snickers bar or pizza. These changes were so drastically different from what I was previously doing, that making them just made me start rapidly putting on weight so I didn't put too much more thought into diet. If my weight/strength wasnt stalling and I was recovering adequately, i'm happy with what i'm doing. 

Met my (rough idea of) calorie count and protein count (0.8g/lb minimum, was more like 1.5g/lb most days - not hard to hit this protein count when you're ~100lb, protein shake alone is about half that) and try eat some variety  was all I considered.

Supplemented whey protein and creatine from about month 2.","[Progress] 23/M/5'8"" (99lb&gt;118lb) [6 months]","[Progress] 23/M/5'8"" (99lb&gt;118lb) [6 months] Realised this morning marks 6 months since I started really trying to gain weight so I did some reflection and am pretty happy with the progress that I have made so far.

Whey protein once a day w/milk, greek yoghurt, nuts, nut bars, proper meal for dinner such as the classic chicken+rice, eating right before going to sleep, maybe a little too much reliance on easy junk calories such as a snickers bar or pizza. These changes were so drastically different from what I was previously doing, that making them just made me start rapidly putting on weight so I didn't put too much more thought into diet. If my weight/strength wasnt stalling and I was recovering adequately, i'm happy with what i'm doing. 

Met my (rough idea of) calorie count and protein count (0.8g/lb minimum, was more like 1.5g/lb most days - not hard to hit this protein count when you're ~100lb, protein shake alone is about half that) and try eat some variety  was all I considered.

Supplemented whey protein and creatine from about month 2."

* Primarily interested in functional strength with subsidiary aesthetic goals.

**Problem:**

Was doing home workouts from March until September, with a cut so I was down to 170 @ 9% BF. Gyms opened back up so I decided to do a bulk through the end of the year. Started a very rudimentary six-week PPL routine for six-days a week to get back into heavier lifting. Made good progress, got back up to 280 deadlifts and 200 horizontal press, but was lacking on squats (I think because I've been biking a ton and it's exhausting my quads more?)

Gyms are mostly closed back down now. I have access to an outdoor facility (for who knows how long). Reservations are required and only last an hour. I can probably scrape out a bit more than an hour since I work at the gym, but making a reservation is tight since there's easily several thousand members trying to find time and only about 120 slots an hour for about 14 hours a day.

* I'm used to doing a split and hitting every muscle group twice a week for both strength and growth. 
* I'm used to a minimal diet and keeping a relatively low body fat % (between 8 and 10). 
* I think some of my plateaus are purely mental (I'm definitely very afraid of injury). 
* I'm pretty sure I can only reliably get between 3 and 4 reservations a week.

My inclination is to try something like GVL (German Volume Lifting) since it's an every other day routine, but I wonder about doing full-body stuff every other day instead? I'm also wondering what impact the biking is going to have on my ability to push my leg lifts, and how I can circumvent any ""'downsides"" to that if they exist at all.

1,"This is my first post here and I think this is within the rules, but I am open to being corrected!

I wanted to make a post to encourage anyone else who is starting to lift and talk about my 10-month progress. I started lifting the first week of February and have been lucky enough to still have weights to lift during gym closures. Unfortunately, I do not have progress pics. It is enough that people have noticed I've been working out though.

**Height/Weight/Age**

Height: 5'11"" (Unchanged)

Weight: 145lbs to 161lbs

Age: 17 to 18

**Progress on B/S/D**

Bench - 115x5 to 210x1/180x6

Squat - 135x5 to 245x5

Deadlift - 185x5 to 280x5

**Weightlifting**

For me, 5x5 has easily been the most effective set/rep scheme for the big three lifts. I have tried 3x8 and some other high rep sets and nothing seems to work as well as sets of 5 heavy reps.  I have no doubt that higher reps work for some people, but 5x5 has worked well for me.

My week has been split into 4 days for the past few months. Days 1 and 3 are Chest/Shoulders/Tris and have flat barbell bench press (5x5) as the main movement. I then add dumbbell shoulder press (4x8), incline dumbbell press (3x8), lateral raises/reverse flyes (3x12), and cable flyes/tricep pushdowns (3x12). I cannot overemphasize the large benefits that tricep pushdowns have seemed to have for my bench press. Days 2 and 4 are Legs/Back/Biceps. Day 2 has the barbell back squat (5x5) as the main movement. It is followed by pendlay row (4x8), single-leg romanian deadlifts (3x12), lat pulldowns (3x12), and standing calf raise (3x15). Day 4 has the barbell deadlift (5x5) as the main movement. It is followed by one arm bent over dumbbell rows (4x8), bulgarian split squats (3x12), and bicep curls (3x12). I do pull-ups throughout every day, so I don't include them in the gym workouts. Do not neglect your back and legs! I know everyone wants bigger pecs and a nice bench, but you can't do it without a strong back and legs. 

**Nutrition**

I have made sure to get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day and then I just let the other macros fall wherever they fall. I have been eating 3300 to 3500 calories per day. I have found that cooking my own food I the best way to have controllable and steady progress.  I normally make eggs and have greek yogurt for breakfast every day and some sort of meat with rice/protein pasta for lunch on weekdays. My mom cooks dinner so that is different every night. I eat out on the weekends, but I am careful to eat healthy foods with good macros. Peanut butter has been one of the best tools for gaining weight in my experience. It has plenty of calories and is very easy to eat. I have one scoop of protein powder most days to help reach my goal.

**Conclusion**

Progress in the weight room can increase your confidence greatly. Don't let it be the only reason you're more confident of course. You simply have to eat, even when you don't want to if you want to gain weight. All of the muscles in your body work together in some way. Your squat can help you bench even though they train different parts of the body. Lifting weights is really simple for beginners like me. All you need to do is lift some heavy weight and you'll see progress.

|Squat|40kg|100kg (story below)|

&amp;#x200B;

I already have some muscle in the before pic as I wasn't completely untrained at that point, but it's about 6 weeks after I started training again after I had my leg cast removed (ankle surgery). My story of starting out lifting is pretty similar to most guys, came out of a relationship, tall and super skinny guy who was underweight and I wanted to fix that. Bought a few dumbbells, started to toy around at home with bro splits. I gained a little bit of muscle but I tore the ligaments in my right ankle and required surgery. After the cast came off I had zero muscle left in my leg, and as I've had two ACL reconstructions and shoulder surgery after a torn labrum in the past I decided enough was enough, so I signed up to a gym and started doing the Reddit PPL. It kind of escalated from there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Workouts**

I ran the Reddit PPL for 6 months and saw a really good increase in muscle and strength. I have severe pectus for those who couldn't tell and my chest has always been a major weak point, both in size and strength. I really liked benching but 70kg was my absolute max and I wanted to improve that so I decided to go for a 5 day version of Nsuns with my accessory work focused on balanced hypertrophy. This was high volume and my body responded really well to it, I benched a 1RM of 90kg on NYE last year. I kept doing this and in april before gyms closed I did a really poor 160kg deadlift (no clue how I didn't injure myself) and a 62.5kg strict press.

While gyms were closed I did a 6 day per week home workout with a sloppy setup, some DBs and a pull up bar. I had occasional access to a gym to bench but my max dropped to 82.5kg and only my back saw a reasonable increase in size due to bb rows and weighted pull ups I could do at home. As soon as the gyms opened I went back to doing nSuns but injured my rotator cuff 3 weeks in. I decided powerlifting training wasn't worth it as my goal was a classic physique anyway, so I switched to a 6 day PPL I designed myself, I've since periodized that and still run that to this day. About 2 months ago I had a subluxation of my kneecap and I can no longer squat (I never really could anyway), so I changed my 2 leg days and I'm following Greg Nuckols 2 day intermediate deadlift right now because that's something I can do quite comfortably and I like doing it. Hope to hit the 200kg deadlift by the end of the year, not sure if possible but it's good to be ambitious.

**Nutrition**

My nutrition is relatively simple, I have and have had 0 issues maintaining strict discipline (be it nutrition or 6 day training regimes). The first lesson I learned is that I had to eat way, way, way more than I was doing. Right now after coming out of a cut (93kg -&gt; 87kg) I'm on 3850 kcal a day for a very slight surplus. I cycle a lot and I'm very tall, especially the latter seems to play a major part. I have 0 clue what BF% I am.

My macros are 90g fat, 270g protein and the rest carbs. A lot of veggies, dairy (I tolerate lactose super well) and high quality grains and rice make up the bulk of my diet. I very rarely have cheat meals. This won't work for most people but it is perfectly sustainable for me, I have been toying around with the macros a bit, at the end of the day the amount of calories is what's important.

**Lessons learned and future steps**

Things I've learned, might not necessarily be good advise for everybody.

* do what works for you, you have to enjoy it and be able to sustain it or it makes 0 sense. You want to train 2 days? Then train hard for 2 days, you're not doing this for a living
* form form form, learn to recognize injuries and learn how to prevent and treat them before they get too serious, get medical help if you're unsure

&amp;#x200B;

I already have some muscle in the before pic as I wasn't completely untrained at that point, but it's about 6 weeks after I started training again after I had my leg cast removed (ankle surgery). My story of starting out lifting is pretty similar to most guys, came out of a relationship, tall and super skinny guy who was underweight and I wanted to fix that. Bought a few dumbbells, started to toy around at home with bro splits. I gained a little bit of muscle but I tore the ligaments in my right ankle and required surgery. After the cast came off I had zero muscle left in my leg, and as I've had two ACL reconstructions and shoulder surgery after a torn labrum in the past I decided enough was enough, so I signed up to a gym and started doing the Reddit PPL. It kind of escalated from there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Workouts**

I ran the Reddit PPL for 6 months and saw a really good increase in muscle and strength. I have severe pectus for those who couldn't tell and my chest has always been a major weak point, both in size and strength. I really liked benching but 70kg was my absolute max and I wanted to improve that so I decided to go for a 5 day version of Nsuns with my accessory work focused on balanced hypertrophy. This was high volume and my body responded really well to it, I benched a 1RM of 90kg on NYE last year. I kept doing this and in april before gyms closed I did a really poor 160kg deadlift (no clue how I didn't injure myself) and a 62.5kg strict press.

While gyms were closed I did a 6 day per week home workout with a sloppy setup, some DBs and a pull up bar. I had occasional access to a gym to bench but my max dropped to 82.5kg and only my back saw a reasonable increase in size due to bb rows and weighted pull ups I could do at home. As soon as the gyms opened I went back to doing nSuns but injured my rotator cuff 3 weeks in. I decided powerlifting training wasn't worth it as my goal was a classic physique anyway, so I switched to a 6 day PPL I designed myself, I've since periodized that and still run that to this day. About 2 months ago I had a subluxation of my kneecap and I can no longer squat (I never really could anyway), so I changed my 2 leg days and I'm following Greg Nuckols 2 day intermediate deadlift right now because that's something I can do quite comfortably and I like doing it. Hope to hit the 200kg deadlift by the end of the year, not sure if possible but it's good to be ambitious.

**Nutrition**

My nutrition is relatively simple, I have and have had 0 issues maintaining strict discipline (be it nutrition or 6 day training regimes). The first lesson I learned is that I had to eat way, way, way more than I was doing. Right now after coming out of a cut (93kg -&gt; 87kg) I'm on 3850 kcal a day for a very slight surplus. I cycle a lot and I'm very tall, especially the latter seems to play a major part. I have 0 clue what BF% I am.

My macros are 90g fat, 270g protein and the rest carbs. A lot of veggies, dairy (I tolerate lactose super well) and high quality grains and rice make up the bulk of my diet. I very rarely have cheat meals. This won't work for most people but it is perfectly sustainable for me, I have been toying around with the macros a bit, at the end of the day the amount of calories is what's important.

**Lessons learned and future steps**

Things I've learned, might not necessarily be good advise for everybody.

* do what works for you, you have to enjoy it and be able to sustain it or it makes 0 sense. You want to train 2 days? Then train hard for 2 days, you're not doing this for a living
* form form form, learn to recognize injuries and learn how to prevent and treat them before they get too serious, get medical help if you're unsure
* find out what you respond well to, don't do things that hurt or simply don't seem to work. For aesthetics no 1 exercise is mandatory
* tailor generic programs to your needs, everybody needs different volumes and responds differently to certain impulses

1,"Howdy Gainers,

Before we begin, [this is the article that contains ""Eating Through The Sticking Point"" by Matt Reynolds, where the pan of cake a day is discussed among other ideas](https://startingstrength.com/article/eating_through_the_sticking_points)

I've shared this article before, but felt like it deserved particular focus, especially in this holiday season while we are surrounded by good food and ample opportunities to enjoy it.  The notion of ""eating through the sticking points"" comes by way of Hugh Cassidy, an OG Powerlifter that boasts numerous accomplishments, to include winning the first World Championship of powerlifting against giants such as Jim Williams and John Kuc by way of pulling a 790lb deadlift along with an 800lb squat and a 570lb bench, all without powerlifting supportive equipment.  

Cassidy's idea was a simple and effective one: the weights you lift are proportional to your own bodyweight.  If your bodyweight goes UP, the proportion improves.  If you weigh 100lbs and try to bench 400lbs, it's a 4x bodyweight bench.  Bring your bodyweight up to 200 and it's 2x.  Bring it up to 300 and it's 1.5x.  Etc.  It was not uncommon for trainees under Cassidy to put on 3lbs in between workouts in order to come back and crush previous poundages.


[Bruce Randall](https://www.chaosandpain.com/tips/tips-anybody-can-get-lean-bulk-first-then-worry-about-your-abs-the-story-of-bruce-randall/) had similar observations as well, and utilized that approach to become a champion weightlifter AND THEN went on to become a champion bodybuilder.  As, once again, it proves true that fat is FAR easier to lose than muscle is to gain.

As we endeavor in our quest to gain muscle, remember these options afforded you.  If things are stalling in the weight room, you can manipulate programming and do all sorts of tricks and hacks, but one of the first instincts as a gainer should be to eat through the sticking points.","Holidays Are Here: No Better Time Than Now For The ""Pan Of Cake A Day Diet""+Other Great Ideas In ""Eating Through The Sticking Points""","Holidays Are Here: No Better Time Than Now For The ""Pan Of Cake A Day Diet""+Other Great Ideas In ""Eating Through The Sticking Points"" Howdy Gainers,

1,"Hey guys!

I’ve always been extremely underweight because I’ve struggled with eating food in general, because I saw it as more of a chore than anything else. I love to eat food that I love, but my mother would usually cook for me, and I’d just end up not finishing my food. The same applies for university, where I’d eat from the dining hall, but I would struggle to finish it, *for whatever reason.*

In any case, I was forced to sustain myself for a week—I bought myself my groceries and spices, and I essentially just planned through my entire week. Today was the first day that I actually cooked for myself, and for breakfast, I followed a very simple recipe online, but I put my own twist on it (because I prefer to use my own spice profile). After finishing cooking and I finally got to eat it... it was actually so delicious! I kept eating and eating, and I had to stop myself from eating any more. For dinner I freestyled a bit, but the same principle applied: I cooked for myself, I enjoyed it a lot, and I ate so much I had to stop myself. 

This seems obvious to say, but **enjoying your food** goes a long way in how much of it you’re willing to eat. If you don’t cook for yourself, you should learn! Nobody knows what you like to eat better than yourself. And if you do cook for yourself, but you find yourself struggling to motivate yourself to eat your food, perhaps try changing it up! Use different spices, change the way you cook, follow some recipes, take some classes, whatever helps you enjoy your food more! Eating 2500+ calories a day seemed insurmountable to me at first, but just eating today’s food made it seem incredibly easy. 

Clearly, this doesn’t apply to everyone, and this may seem very obvious to some of you guys, but I know that there are a couple of people who are slower on this than myself. So, I just wanted to share this piece of advice. 

Good luck out there!","If you struggle with eating, and you don’t cook your own food, you should start","If you struggle with eating, and you don’t cook your own food, you should start Hey guys!

This is me [then](https://imgur.com/a/sDndF6N) (about two years ago) and [now](https://imgur.com/a/5Ke6NBI).

I still strive to be in the gym 4-5 days per week and it has become a passion of mine. It's stress relief, and time I put aside to do something for me and me alone. When I first started working out it wasn't my intention to be the biggest or the strongest, and it still isn't. I just wanted to look more ""normal"", but now I really enjoy the feeling of knowing I'm getting stronger and my hard work is paying off.

For workouts I still follow a push/pull/legs split. One thing I focus on much more now is spending time on compound movements, especially the big three. My squat has always been held back by mild congenital hip dysplasia so it's been a bit harder for me to grow my quads. My PRs aren't great, but its a huge accomplishment to me anyways, because I remember where I started. 2 years ago I could barely curl 10 lbs in one hand and couldn't bench the bar.

As far as diet, I pretty much eat healthy-ish, and focus on getting in good protein. Protein was the key for me to gaining and also to maintaining. I don't track calories or macros anymore. My weight has been very consistent for a while now, apart from minor fluctuations.

Overall I'm much more confident now than two years ago. I also feel healthier and better overall. I was always tired and low energy at 95 lbs. I remember it used to hurt to sit for too long because of my bones having no cushion, and my posture was terrible because those muscle groups were so underdeveloped. And I didn't have success immediately in the gym, I was very self conscious and insecure, due to lack of knowledge and experience on top of my scrawniness. But I just dove in head first and read as much as I could from places like this. I've learned a ton since then, and now I am confident enough to help friends who are wanting to start getting in the gym.

I only eat 1200 to 1400 calories a day!
And I don't get enough healthy fats, at all.

That is honestly way less than I expected and I made an effort to eat a bit more today. Couldn't finish my lunch, but I ate more than normal.

Eating enough to actually gain weight is honestly a lot harder than I thought it was.
Doesn't help that my mother comments on every single pound I gain calling me fat lol.

1,"I need advice on my current fitness regime and how it can be improved! Sorry for the super long post but here we go! 

I started working out 8 years ago when I was 21 and put on muscle very quickly. I competed in two bodybuilding shows in 2014 &amp; 2015 in bikini. After both shows I rebounded and ended up gaining about 25lbs in about 2 months. Fortunately I continued lifting heavy and made serious gains during these rebounds. I bulked for about a year after my last show and then stayed in a maintenance phase until 2018, still lifting heavy. I looked very muscular for my size (5'1) and it was extremely noticeable that I worked out, even during ""bulking"". At my heaviest I was around 128lbs. 

In 2018 I started intermittent fasting to cut weight for an upcoming event. I had really great results and stayed in a deficit for a while. I cut down to about 112lbs and looked really great with all of that muscle. I have struggled in the I past with disordered eating and bullemia. I got extremely comfortable being lean and kept pushing myself more and more to lose more weight. I was still working out but eating very little and infrequently. Then in 2019 I started dealing with extreme anxiety and depression due to other factors, I stopped working out for almost an entire month and sometimes went a few days eating absolutely nothing. I had virtually no appetite and was constantly stressed. I didn't notice myself shrinking at first. Once I hit 102lbs I kinda just realized pretty much all of my muscle vanished. I'm ashamed I let it happen because I know better. I'm disappointed in myself and hate seeing myself in the mirror. 

So here we are now. I've slowly been adding in more calories since January 2020 and have worked my way up to 3000 cal/day. Right now I am around 126lbs. I've been lifting about 3-4 times/week. I try my best to go 4-5 days but I am in school and work full time so my time is very limited. I feel like I'm having issues gaining my muscle back - especially my GLUTES. I also started working at a more sedentary job in 2019 and I really started to notice lower back pain during my leg workouts. I now realize that from sitting all day I likely have glute amnesia. I now have a standing desk and stand most of my workday. I am working from home and doing school from home so unfortunately I don't get much daily activity. My metabolism seems to be on fire. Any day that I eat under 3000 cal I wake up feeling lean and deflated (which is not my goal right now). This has made gaining weight and muscle has been challenging. I'm putting on some muscle, but not as quickly as I did before. 

I am natural, no enhancement drugs or steroids. I smoke cannabis every night to stimulate my appetite. For supplements I take bcaas and protein powder. I'm trying to be more consistent with incorporating creatine but I've been forgetting often. I go to physiotherapy, chiropractor, and massage therapy all to help my lower back and glute issues. My workouts are a 5 day split with 3 leg days and 2 upper body days. I am still progressively overloading and adding weight every week. I do heavy compound lifts (225 sumo deadlift, 175 squat, &amp; 85 bench). I just feel like I was able to gain mass so much quicker when I was 21 vs 29 and its extremely depressing that I've set myself back so much. As I get older I also am way more prone to aches and pains which makes lifting a challenge at times. Also during quarantine I did my best to continue lifting heavy at home, but unfortunately my appetite vanished once again and I stopped eating as much as I had been. I've been consistent with my eating and lifting since July once gyms opened in my province. I still just feel like I'm so far behind what I was and I don't feel my gains are coming back.

[125 vs 160 lbs](https://imgur.com/a/TQlR37G) 

### Programs

I initially made my own linear progression, and did that for approximately 8 months maybe more? I dunno, in that range. I won't detail it because it was dumb. Don't do that. Follow literally any other linear progression and it will be better. I went from 125 - 150 lb, then back down to 138 lb during that time. After that I switched to u/utben free intermediate program for 3 rounds, all my lifts exploded and I went from 138 - 156 lb. (*People are asking for the program. To save you looking in the comments, you can find it here https://peakhd.net/p/free-intermediate-program). Amazing what intelligent programming can do. Then I did 1 round of Megazord by u/BeanchPauper, which took me into end of last year and up to 159 lb. 

I ignored conditioning during that time like a dummy, so I thought January would be good to get some of my base back and ran Tactical Barbell 2 base building, which has no heavy lifting in it whatsoever. Right at the end of that, lockdown happened, leaving me to my own devices and sitting at 155 lb. I made a 66 lb and 100 lb sandbag, did what I could with them for a month and a half, then ran a bastardized Deep Water beginner and Intermediate with them. I remained at 155 lb for the entirely of lock down. I didn't lift heavy from January until about September of this year as a result.

About a week or two after that I managed to piece enough of my home gym together to lift at home in Septemberish I believe and started the reddit novice program to get my feet wet again. I'm still running that and setting rep prs, which is both odd and fantastic to me. I am sitting at 160 lb currently.

### Lifts

All time tested: 345/210/435/135 in December 2019

Current:

Squat: 280 x 7

Bench: 195 x 7

Deadlift: 355 x 8

OHP: 110 x 7

### Diet

I eat consistently, and as a result, I don't count calories. When I want to increase weight I increase the size of individual meals by approximately 250 equivalent calories chunks and see if I'm budging the scale. So as an example, I might add a cup of rice to dinner or I may change my protein shake to having milk and peanut butter in it. When that stops working, I'll add to a different meal. Conversely, when I want to lose weight, I'll do the opposite. 

Typical current daily diet:

Breakfast 1: Beet smoothie (cup of frozen beets, cup of frozen mixed berries/pomegranate, fresh orange juice) + separate 2 scoop protein shake with 1 cup milk and 2 T peanut butter.

Breakfast 2: 4 boiled eggs

Lunch: 150g cold cut sandwich (mortadella, prosciutto, turkey breast, whatever) with greens, onions, tomatoes and mayo.

Dinner: 1/2 lb meat (all sorts of fatty meats), bunch of veggies, 2 cups rice. 

I haven't bothered to calculate how many calories this is, because I find it unnecessary to know. 

If anyone wants to know how I specifically worked up to eating this, ask me and I'd be happy to detail it.  

### Lessons

There's no fucking chance you could have told 125 lb me that I'd ever be this big. I absolutely would have not believed it and called you a liar. I honestly thought I didn't have the genetics to support that, my metabolism was way too high and that I was started at too old an age. All of that is clearly garbage, and if you find yourself thinking like that, stop. It doesn't even matter if it's true or not, because regardless, you can blast past those limitations with time, consistency and trying. Hell, I didn't even do shit correctly in the beginning, made up my own lp and it still worked out just fine.  

### Goals that I'm working towards:

I'd like to hit a 500 lb deadlift and suspect I'll have to get up to 175ish lb to do that. I'd also like to run a half marathon in 2 hours because fuck everyone who thinks I can't, and my athletic endeavors run mostly on spite damn it!",[Progress] M/36/5'4: 125 - 160 lb,"[Progress] M/36/5'4: 125 - 160 lb I joined the gym in May 2017 and I recently found a picture of myself before going to the gym while scrolling through my phone.

Follow literally any other linear progression and it will be better. I went from 125 - 150 lb, then back down to 138 lb during that time. After that I switched to u/utben free intermediate program for 3 rounds, all my lifts exploded and I went from 138 - 156 lb. (*People are asking for the program. To save you looking in the comments, you can find it here https://peakhd.net/p/free-intermediate-program). Amazing what intelligent programming can do. Then I did 1 round of Megazord by u/BeanchPauper, which took me into end of last year and up to 159 lb. 

I ignored conditioning during that time like a dummy, so I thought January would be good to get some of my base back and ran Tactical Barbell 2 base building, which has no heavy lifting in it whatsoever. Right at the end of that, lockdown happened, leaving me to my own devices and sitting at 155 lb. I made a 66 lb and 100 lb sandbag, did what I could with them for a month and a half, then ran a bastardized Deep Water beginner and Intermediate with them. I remained at 155 lb for the entirely of lock down. I didn't lift heavy from January until about September of this year as a result.

About a week or two after that I managed to piece enough of my home gym together to lift at home in Septemberish I believe and started the reddit novice program to get my feet wet again. I'm still running that and setting rep prs, which is both odd and fantastic to me. I am sitting at 160 lb currently.

### Lifts

All time tested: 345/210/435/135 in December 2019

Current:

Squat: 280 x 7

Bench: 195 x 7

Deadlift: 355 x 8

OHP: 110 x 7

### Diet

I eat consistently, and as a result, I don't count calories. When I want to increase weight I increase the size of individual meals by approximately 250 equivalent calories chunks and see if I'm budging the scale. So as an example, I might add a cup of rice to dinner or I may change my protein shake to having milk and peanut butter in it. When that stops working, I'll add to a different meal. Conversely, when I want to lose weight, I'll do the opposite. 

Typical current daily diet:

Breakfast 1: Beet smoothie (cup of frozen beets, cup of frozen mixed berries/pomegranate, fresh orange juice) + separate 2 scoop protein shake with 1 cup milk and 2 T peanut butter.

Breakfast 2: 4 boiled eggs

Lunch: 150g cold cut sandwich (mortadella, prosciutto, turkey breast, whatever) with greens, onions, tomatoes and mayo.

Dinner: 1/2 lb meat (all sorts of fatty meats), bunch of veggies, 2 cups rice. 

I haven't bothered to calculate how many calories this is, because I find it unnecessary to know. 

If anyone wants to know how I specifically worked up to eating this, ask me and I'd be happy to detail it.  

### Lessons

There's no fucking chance you could have told 125 lb me that I'd ever be this big. I absolutely would have not believed it and called you a liar. I honestly thought I didn't have the genetics to support that, my metabolism was way too high and that I was started at too old an age. All of that is clearly garbage, and if you find yourself thinking like that, stop. It doesn't even matter if it's true or not, because regardless, you can blast past those limitations with time, consistency and trying. Hell, I didn't even do shit correctly in the beginning, made up my own lp and it still worked out just fine.  

### Goals that I'm working towards:

I'd like to hit a 500 lb deadlift and suspect I'll have to get up to 175ish lb to do that. I'd also like to run a half marathon in 2 hours because fuck everyone who thinks I can't, and my athletic endeavors run mostly on spite damn it!"

1,"Hey I wanted to share three mistakes I made in my first 2 years of lifting and how I stayed at a pretty beginner level the whole time as a result of it. This is just personal so I have 0 clue if it will work but if your training isn't going where you want it try it out. 

1) I tried training 5-6 days a week, 

as a result of having this goal I usually only made it to 4 days and would beat myself up over missing that 5th day and anytime I did lift 5 days a week I would be wiped the next week and feel terrible missing more workouts and feeling worse about it. I switched to working out 4 days a week and it keeps the gym fresh and fun and keeps me super motivated to push myself to the limit every time I'm there which I think is key as I got complacent after feeling like I'm always in the gym.


2)  I chose weight as the first way to add resistance, 

Personally, this has caused 99.99% of all injuries I have occurred and I think so many lifters are guilty of this. The thing is I didn't even feel like I was ego lifting but rather as soon as I would crank out 8 reps at X weight id automatically increase maybe 5-10 pounds. Personally, this caused a lot of weight on my joints despite having reviewed and videotaped my form it just felt like it took a toll on me and as a guy in my early 20's that's a scare. 

Instead I really ""mastered"" each rep and I know it sounds cheesy but I do 5 sets of 12-15 strict reps with an extremely slow decline and you'll be able to lift 1/2 of the weight you used to and will feel like it took 120% of the effort you used to use to lift the old heavier weight. This has caused my gains to explode over a short 8 month period when compared to about 2 years of lifting the older way. In addition to this I added weighted calisthenics to this and you'll die trying to do 5X15 weighted pull-ups and dips esp if you go so slow on the decline. 

Also on the injury's side, all my nagging pains have gone away even on my problem exercises (now I also do physio and stretch a lot this new style has just not regressed my injuries its not fixing them actively I am).



3) I didn't address my injuries and take the time I needed off and worked too many front exercises

If your shoulder is nagging you then stop working out your shoulder replace it with cardio in your workouts or whatever you want. The point is immediately stop and start rehabbing and stretching the muscle and come back and start resistance bands if you can do those for a week or 2 start back in SLOWLY on the exercises I usually do 1/2 the weight and 1/2 the reps just to get the blood in there the goal is just to rehab without snapping something and having to take 8-16 months off vs 1. Lastly I worked so many chest exercises and front delts and realized I'm completely neglecting my back and it caused SO MANY muscular imbalances and injures and was a big hole in my physique too hit your rows like crazy and those rear delts I like to do 2 pulls for every push movement.



Again these were my thoughts I figured it might be good to consider lmk

However, between being at home and not living the same lifestyle that I was back on campus, I've put on a fair amount of weight, and not the good kind. I'm up to just under 160lbs, which would be great if it were lean muscle, but its definitely mostly fat as a result of my more sedentary lifestyle. The body fat calculators that I've looked at have clocked me in at a little under 20%, which is far from where I want to be. I've been incorporating more cardio into my day-to-day routines to trim this down some, and have been trying to eat healthier food and less calories, but considering I'm hoping to get back in the gym anyway, I'm wondering if I should seek to lose some of this body fat before I start trying to put on muscle mass, or if I should just go for it anyway and hope it gets evened out as I try to focus more on building muscle.

I try to push myself to lift more weights/reps every workout, have eaten at a surplus for 9 months which just made me fatter but barely any stronger. After my unsuccessful bulk attempt I cut down again which probably was a good choice, I didn't lose what little strength I had. 

I have a few problems with my shoulder and lower back so I've been doing daily PT and stretching so I can go back to deadlifting and overhead pressing.

0,"This past year I went from an ""obese"" BMI (which I'm pretty sure I didn't look, I carried those pounds like a champ)  to a ""normal"" weight. Face gains can be seen [here!](https://imgur.com/a/1UgSqTb) For reference, I'm 5'4.

I've always been an active person. I was a competitive dancer from ages 5 to 14, and a three-sport athlete as a teenager. I had always been *tiny*, until puberty hit. At that time my metabolism slowed, my chest grew exponentially (32HH UK sizing at its largest), and I hated how I looked. I developed an eating disorder and fought my curvy adult body type until I was in college. I got therapy, started to heal my relationship with food, and my weight steadily went up and up and up. I continued to exercise; hiking, weight lifting, skiing. I was diagnosed with some chronic health problems around that time, including a vein disease, multiple-strain chronic lyme's disease, and chronic pain due to my chest size. I stopped exercising for the most part, because it *hurt*. 

By the time I met my now wife, and finished college, I knew I needed to make changes. I just felt really unhealthy. Obviously, the change I made was to enroll in doctoral-level graduate school! My stress went through the roof, and I also developed hypertension! Second-year of my grad program, I decided to try and get my health and stress under control. My career involves helping others be mentally healthy, and I wasn't healthy myself. So I got surgery to correct my vein disease. I did physical therapy for my chronic pain, and a few months later, I had an insurance-covered breast reduction surgery. Being able to stand on my feet without pain, and with my back pain greatly reduced, I was able to start exercising again.

Then COVID! I gained a good 15 pounds from drinking excess alcohol and eating excess junk food due to boredom and being stuck inside.  I hit my peak of 175, and I knew a ""lifestyle change"" was in order. I was worried about CICO due to my history of eating disorders, and initially had my wife plan my meals for me and count for me. Eventually, I was able to take over control and eat more intuitively, as I had a good understanding of what my portions should be. I'd estimate for Sept 2020 - March 2021 I ate within the range of 1200-1600 calories a day. I also stationary bike most mornings, walk a mile or two every day and hike most weekends. I eat what I want, just small portions and in a mindful way. 

I haven't felt this good ever. The last time I was this thin I was in high school, and actively purging. Now I am thin and strong because I have taken care of myself. I am really proud and sad I can't really share this with most people in my life. My wife is proud of me, as is my mother. My clients haven't noticed, and neither have my friends? Unless it's just hard to tell over Zoom or they don't feel comfortable telling me. It's an odd thing to celebrate.

0,"**a little back story:**

i want to preface this by saying that i spent ten years subscribing to fat acceptance logic, ultimately believing calorie-counting etc. was incongruous with my feminist politics. i still believe fatphobia is a thing; i grew up in a family that was pretty fatphobic, and my parents were consistently derogatory about my aunt's weight. she was morbidly obese and died of bowel cancer in her early 60s. her death was clearly related to her weight but at the time i was just sad that my dad couldn't even have a funeral for her without commenting on her size in pictures. so i know the reasons why fat acceptance logic gets lodged in your brain - it's angering that fat folks are dehumanised to the extent they are, and yes 100% i think that it's wrapped up in misogyny. 

anyway, i was a tall and slender child but also gender-nonconforming from a young age. idk if i would consider myself trans now but i was always non-binary as hell as a kid. puberty and adolescence was extremely traumatic as a queer in a rural village with a lot of homophobia and transphobia at school. so i was body conscious as fuck and desperate to fit in, but always remember riding the wave of my slimness and tallness to insulate me from the additional shame of having excess fat. then i discovered alcohol in my early teens and drank consistently to deal with my sadness, for a very long time. at university this habit really took flight, and wasn't helped by the fact that from my late teens throughout my 20s, i was a touring musician. i was in bars and venues almost every weekend, and often for stretches of a few weeks at a time. my eating and drinking habits went out the window, particularly because payments for gigs for many years incorporated drinks riders and buy-outs. i got used to the idea that i was just going to be 'hench' or a 'big, strong person', which also fitted with my identity as a relatively masculine-of-centre woman who is also a guitarist. 

i discovered exercise properly at about 27, when i decided to try and learn how to jog for my mental health. i loved it but felt like i could never advance properly because i was always recovering from drinking or eating too much. i was vegetarian from age 20 to 29 so was also riding the wave of not eating meat, in terms of my weight remaining relatively stable, despite being above healthy BMI. then i met my partner, a food-loving canadian who is just over 4 years younger than me. she introduced me to the world of north american meat: chicken wings, ribs... we enjoyed ourselves so much as we were getting to know each other but good god: because i hadn't eaten meat really as an adult, i was on meat holiday in a big way. i really went to town, and the whole time i was reading more and more fat acceptance stuff, learning from fat activists in my music scene and community, and touring more than i ever had in my life. i could sense myself expanding but was becoming gradually more alienated from my own body. at the same time, i was deepening my relationship to running, and even did a half marathon. so i was like: yeah, big people can be athletic! and eat whatever they want! woo! 

NOT woo. so from 28 to 31, i was doing a phd. the last year, in particular, involved pretty much sitting all day long. my eating habits and alcohol consumption were also beginning to make exercise less appealing and less possible; i would go for runs and have to break every 10 minutes. alcohol was having a cumulative effect on my mental health: i would have terrible insomnia, i couldn't regulate my temperature, i was consumed with negative thoughts about myself, i had eroding trust in other people and was convinced this was just what life became when you lived in a capitalist hellscape. obviously i figured the best way to deal with these emotions and mental illness was just to....keep drinking whisky and eating M&amp;Ms. and this is the kind of shit i was consuming on instagram too: that i should just listen to my intuition and eat whatever i want because that is self-care.

so anyway, the pandemic comes along and me and my partner - who had become my wife by this point - go HAM with the ham, effectively. we literally spent two months playing breath of the wild, getting shitfaced and ordering mcdonalds. it was, tbh, really fun. but my head and my body were suffering. and i was starting to seriously dislike the way that i looked. thing is, this wasn't a new thing: from childhood i had felt disparaging about my body for obvious reasons, and didn't look in the mirror, for example, for years. when i did look in the mirror it was just for confirmation that i still sucked. but photos of me at gigs from before covid were unavoidable and i was progressively shocked at how overweight i looked. still, these thoughts and feelings came attached to inside voices shaming and policing me for critiquing my own body, as if i was being a terrible feminist and terrible ally to my fat friends. so i just buried it and continued on my merry, buttery way. 

in september i got my first full-time academic job and something in me just totally flipped. i realised i literally couldn't continue drinking in the way that i had been if i wanted to do well as a lecturer. my wife and i were going through an eviction by an evil homophobic landlord that lived in the house above us and the stress of that was also pushing us more and more to shit food and the bottle. i realised i wanted more mental and physical resilience and to live my best life, if only to stick it to people like her. so i bought a scale for the first time in my life. i had not had a scale for my entire 20s, believing them to be oppressive to women and part of the auditing, measuring culture that contributes to stress and feelings of inadequacy. 

anyway, i got this scale and i stood on it and sure as day, i was 234 lbs. in my wildest imaginings of where my weight had gotten to, this was a distant number. i immediately took to the NHS BMI calculator and there it was: BMI of 32.7 (i'm a tall human), you're obese baby. for the first couple of days i was in denial - i googled things like 'i don't look obese but BMI says i'm obese'. in my head, obese people looked like my aunt or lizzo. at the same time, i was also still struggling against the fat acceptance narratives in my head: i'm obese, isn't this something i should celebrate or something? literally it makes no sense to me now but that is something i genuinely thought. i'm not exaggerating. so after a couple of days of denial, peppered with anger and dispair, i was just like: yeah i'm gonna have to fix this. i figured out that i needed to lose 56 pounds to get to a 'healthy' BMI. when i told my wife this was the amount of weight i had to lose she was like shiiiiiiit. but she never doubted me. so here is how i did it: 

**how i lost 56 lbs in 5 months:**

Step One: 

i quit alcohol. forever. i stopped drinking on september 13, and my wife did too. i don't say this like it's easy for people, but it's hands-down the most important and best thing i've ever done for myself. i'm not gonna go on about the joys of being tee-total in this post (it belongs to another post probably) but there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that cutting out alcohol was one of the key reasons i was able to lose the weight i did. i also feel literally incomparably happier than i ever have in my adult life.  i still smoke weed - couple of tokes a night - so i don't consider myself sober, but alcohol poisoned my belief in myself and my body and i knew if i wanted to take my health seriously it needed to go. 

Step Two: 

i quit animal products, as did my wife. a week after i quit drinking, i decided to go vegan. at first i was still eating honey but that's gone now too. again, hate to be evangelical about this, but it made my body feel healthier than it ever has in my adult life. coupled with zero-alcohol, i started having the energy of like, my 9-year-old self. my skin youthened by about 5 years. seriously, my wife and i were like WE HAVE BENJAMIN BUTTONED OURSELVES WHAT IS HAPPENING. In the first two months of no booze and being vegan, weight melted off me. From 5 October to 29 November, I lost 19 pounds. i was exercising too, but not like crazy. nothing more intense than what i had been doing before, which was running about 3 times a week. 

Step Three: 

i started actually drinking water. didn't do that before, quite literally couldn't understand the point (so alienated from my body and its needs). anyway, i started drinking at least two litres a day and it seemed to help everything on its way. also, my pee smelled better. win! 

Step Four: 

i unplugged from the internet. i deleted facebook and eventually instagram. this was an important part of my weight loss journey because i hadn't realised how susceptible i was to group think, and how disciplining social media was about what constitutes a morally good life or decision. unplugging from social media feeds allowed me to start thinking for myself, and spending more time in nature. that said, i compensated for my lack of feeds by getting heavily into youtube. obese to beast (john glaude) \*really\* helped me. i got super into his videos and started to understand that, actually, as an anti-capitalist, i was doing worse for the world by supporting the overproduction of food - and the nutritional crisis of obesity that unfolds from it - than by self-flagellating for wanting a smaller body. 

Step Five: 

after the initial weight came off, i had to develop a more serious strategy. first thing i did was actually log my calories. i used my fitness pal for this and it worked well, although i never weighed my food. so a lot of it was eyeballing/guess-work. i got round this by slightly overestimating amounts so that i could insulate myself from disappointment! anyway, without my fitness pal i would never have worked out that actually olive oil isn't inherently good for you. prior to this i would happily use a cup of oil in a salad dressing. so i started switching things out and becoming a bit more inventive: i would use vinegar bases for dressings, and use tahini to thicken it up instead. 

Step Six: 

i started doing body-weight training instead of running. this was partly because i ran too much one week and gave myself a hip flexor injury. so instead, i started doing HIITs and lots of planks, bridges and the like in the park in the morning. this made my body feel strong and i think sped up my metabolism. eventually, i mixed bodyweight training and running during the week.

Step Seven: 

i committed to a daily morning practice of food, movement and meditation. without alcohol I was able to go to sleep more easily and wake up more easily. as a result, I was able to gradually get to morning wake-ups at 6am (i had NEVER been a morning person because of alcohol and anxiety but had always dreamt of being one). i have eaten the same breakfast every morning for five months: oatmeal with agave and either half an apple or blueberries. in some ways i credit oatmeal for being my gateway drug to a healthy life. oatmeal powers me up and 45 minutes after eating it, i started going out and exercising, followed by a few minutes of meditation. this routine allowed me to start my day intentionally and with kind words to myself. 

Step Eight: 

i ate a cheat meal at least once a week. often this was a proper cheat meal, e.g. vegan fried chicken burger, giant cookie, fries, soda. i continue to do this every friday and the only thing that's changed is that, as my body gets healthier, i actually have much less desire to eat oily food. still, for me it's been important to have an evening of semi-indulgence. 

Step Nine: 

i stopped eating virtually any processed food and snacks, especially any with added sugar. i thought this would be harder than it was, but i managed it through swapping things out. i ate corn cakes and kallo spinach pesto cakes with vegan pate; i ate a lot of fruit and seeds; i would have like, only one biscuit rather than 25. 

Step Ten: 

i ate loads of fibre. this is easy to do when you're plant-based, but i also went for way more fibrous carbs. i starting making brown rice, sweet potato or quinoa my carb base, and eating it with loads of tempeh or tofu, tahini-based sauces and dressings, lots of green veggies like broccoli and spinach. tbh this is the food i love anyway, so i always felt satiated and satisfied. this diet hugely helped me exercise - i would never feel sleepy after meals (had just thought this was what happened to everyone after eating), and instead would feel energised. almost like... food can be fuel? 

Step Eleven: 

i incorporated movement into my work day. this one was hard because my job is frigging nuts right now, with teaching loads effectively doubled, if not tripled, by online delivery. i got a fitness watch which told me to stand up every hour and showed me how sedentary i was. again, hadn't realised this - really thought that running 3 times a week would somehow compensate for me sitting or lying down 90% of the time. so i started with the standing and then i did some walking at lunchtime, only a few minutes or so. i found this to be pretty boring so i got a LONGBOARD. this was a cheap board i found on ebay. i hate competitive sports and live on Plague Island so doing something solo that wasn't HIIT training or running sounded perfect. i started learning how to longboard in early February and now do that at lunchtime, when i can. i listen to miley cyrus and skate around the park feeling like the coolest 32-year-old in the world. 

Step Twelve: 

by the end of february i had started to plateau. initially this freaked me out but then i went back to treating myself like an interesting science experiment. so i dealt with plateaus through a combination of a) increasing my cardio - in particular, running and jumping more, hip-willing; and b) cutting back on oil. i had started to eat stuff like coconut oil, avocado oil, rapeseed oil - all of which are in vegan foods like pip &amp; nut almond butter, vegan mayo and store-bought hummus. by cutting back - not necessarily eliminating entirely - and doing a bit more cardio, i was able to continue to lose weight. often this was no more than a pound a week but a pound's a pound bitch! 

Step Thirteen: 

i treated weight loss like a degree. i got curious, fascinated, data-driven; i became a scholar of my own adiposity. i made charts that eventually became a spreadsheet, tracking my loss alongside my exercise habits of the month. i mapped out my menstrual cycle and read my weight loss alongside this information (i kept retaining or putting on weight during my period which initially stumped me until i remembered that obviously bodies change then they're menstruating). i consumed HUNDREDS of youtube videos about weight loss; i also listened to podcasts from the other side of the fence, i.e. intuitive eating, health at every size, fat acceptance. i came to the conclusion that the western world - nay the world in its entirety - is in some kind of nihilistic denial that will end in an apocalyptic mukbang while pharmaceutical, food-industry, and petrochemical companies fill their pockets. i also came to the conclusion that yes, obviously the people who are pumped full of the excess sugars and fats attendant upon the over-production of food are often the poorest. i also came to the conclusion that celebrating this is FUCKED UP, and that we should all be very, very angry about it. 

Step Fourteen: 

i talked about weight loss with the people that i know care about me, i.e. my mum, dad, sister, wife, and 1-2 friends. i shared what i was trying to do and how i felt about it. this was totally out of character for me as i had been so against intentional weight loss for so long. i embraced the delicious slice of humble pie and 'i was wrong in the past' accountability that this offered me, while offering a new path to deepening my relationships with those close to me, through the vulnerability of being open about body struggles. 

&amp;#x200B;

anyway i think that's everything. the main things, at least. still hoping to cut down by another 5-10 pounds so i have more wiggle room for my weekend indulgences but other than that, yeah keep going! you'll get there, bit by bit. and as miley sings: 

'Ain't about how fast I get there  
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side  
It's the climb' 

IT'S THE CLIMB EVERYBODY!",obese to healthy BMI in 5 months: here is exactly how i did it,"obese to healthy BMI in 5 months: here is exactly how i did it **a little back story:**

i want to preface this by saying that i spent ten years subscribing to fat acceptance logic, ultimately believing calorie-counting etc. was incongruous with my feminist politics. i still believe fatphobia is a thing; i grew up in a family that was pretty fatphobic, and my parents were consistently derogatory about my aunt's weight. she was morbidly obese and died of bowel cancer in her early 60s. her death was clearly related to her weight but at the time i was just sad that my dad couldn't even have a funeral for her without commenting on her size in pictures. so i know the reasons why fat acceptance logic gets lodged in your brain - it's angering that fat folks are dehumanised to the extent they are, and yes 100% i think that it's wrapped up in misogyny. 

anyway, i was a tall and slender child but also gender-nonconforming from a young age. idk if i would consider myself trans now but i was always non-binary as hell as a kid. puberty and adolescence was extremely traumatic as a queer in a rural village with a lot of homophobia and transphobia at school. so i was body conscious as fuck and desperate to fit in, but always remember riding the wave of my slimness and tallness to insulate me from the additional shame of having excess fat. then i discovered alcohol in my early teens and drank consistently to deal with my sadness, for a very long time. at university this habit really took flight, and wasn't helped by the fact that from my late teens throughout my 20s, i was a touring musician. i was in bars and venues almost every weekend, and often for stretches of a few weeks at a time. my eating and drinking habits went out the window, particularly because payments for gigs for many years incorporated drinks riders and buy-outs. i got used to the idea that i was just going to be 'hench' or a 'big, strong person', which also fitted with my identity as a relatively masculine-of-centre woman who is also a guitarist. 

i discovered exercise properly at about 27, when i decided to try and learn how to jog for my mental health. i loved it but felt like i could never advance properly because i was always recovering from drinking or eating too much. i was vegetarian from age 20 to 29 so was also riding the wave of not eating meat, in terms of my weight remaining relatively stable, despite being above healthy BMI. then i met my partner, a food-loving canadian who is just over 4 years younger than me. she introduced me to the world of north american meat: chicken wings, ribs... we enjoyed ourselves so much as we were getting to know each other but good god: because i hadn't eaten meat really as an adult, i was on meat holiday in a big way. i really went to town, and the whole time i was reading more and more fat acceptance stuff, learning from fat activists in my music scene and community, and touring more than i ever had in my life. i could sense myself expanding but was becoming gradually more alienated from my own body. at the same time, i was deepening my relationship to running, and even did a half marathon. so i was like: yeah, big people can be athletic! and eat whatever they want! woo! 

NOT woo. so from 28 to 31, i was doing a phd. the last year, in particular, involved pretty much sitting all day long. my eating habits and alcohol consumption were also beginning to make exercise less appealing and less possible; i would go for runs and have to break every 10 minutes. alcohol was having a cumulative effect on my mental health: i would have terrible insomnia, i couldn't regulate my temperature, i was consumed with negative thoughts about myself, i had eroding trust in other people and was convinced this was just what life became when you lived in a capitalist hellscape. obviously i figured the best way to deal with these emotions and mental illness was just to....keep drinking whisky and eating M&amp;Ms. and this is the kind of shit i was consuming on instagram too: that i should just listen to my intuition and eat whatever i want because that is self-care.

so anyway, the pandemic comes along and me and my partner - who had become my wife by this point - go HAM with the ham, effectively. we literally spent two months playing breath of the wild, getting shitfaced and ordering mcdonalds. it was, tbh, really fun. but my head and my body were suffering. and i was starting to seriously dislike the way that i looked. thing is, this wasn't a new thing: from childhood i had felt disparaging about my body for obvious reasons, and didn't look in the mirror, for example, for years. when i did look in the mirror it was just for confirmation that i still sucked. but photos of me at gigs from before covid were unavoidable and i was progressively shocked at how overweight i looked. still, these thoughts and feelings came attached to inside voices shaming and policing me for critiquing my own body, as if i was being a terrible feminist and terrible ally to my fat friends. so i just buried it and continued on my merry, buttery way.

0,"14f here, I was in your position in July. I was at a healthy weight at the 50th percentile, but I wanted to lose weight because I was dissastisfied with my body. I tried to make it about loving and taking care of myself, but deep down I knew I was driven by self hatred. I started counting calories and limiting myself to 1200 calories each day. It was hard at first, but slowly I found ways to eat less and less. Before I knew it, I was eating 900, then 800. Nobody noticed until I told my mom I needed some new pants because I ""hadn't been eating due to stress"". Shortly after this, I spiraled into full blown severe anorexia. I ended up in the hospital in October. Now I'm in quasi-recovery, I gained 9 pounds then stopped and I'm lying to my family because I'm terrified of gaining more weight.

I know if I had seen a post like this in July I would have completely ignored it, so I don't really know if I will help anyone, but please see a doctor if you are interested in losing weight before you change anything. If you are at a healthy weight already, you are probably absolutely fine the way you are. Not eating enough can really damage your brain and body, even if it's not a huge caloric deficit. 

If you are going to do it anyway without consulting a doctor and/or your parents, PLEASE look out for some warning signs I should have paid attention to:

\- Constant body checking

\- Wanting to eat less and less every day and feeling successful if I ate less

\- Being at war with myself if I ate more than I had planned

\- Thinking that I had do wait until I was thin to do certain things or wear certain clothes

\- Prioritizing weight loss over everything and obsessing about it

I was at a healthy weight at the 50th percentile, but I wanted to lose weight because I was dissastisfied with my body. I tried to make it about loving and taking care of myself, but deep down I knew I was driven by self hatred. I started counting calories and limiting myself to 1200 calories each day. It was hard at first, but slowly I found ways to eat less and less. Before I knew it, I was eating 900, then 800. Nobody noticed until I told my mom I needed some new pants because I ""hadn't been eating due to stress"". Shortly after this, I spiraled into full blown severe anorexia. I ended up in the hospital in October. Now I'm in quasi-recovery, I gained 9 pounds then stopped and I'm lying to my family because I'm terrified of gaining more weight.

I know if I had seen a post like this in July I would have completely ignored it, so I don't really know if I will help anyone, but please see a doctor if you are interested in losing weight before you change anything. If you are at a healthy weight already, you are probably absolutely fine the way you are. Not eating enough can really damage your brain and body, even if it's not a huge caloric deficit. 

If you are going to do it anyway without consulting a doctor and/or your parents, PLEASE look out for some warning signs I should have paid attention to:

\- Constant body checking

\- Wanting to eat less and less every day and feeling successful if I ate less

\- Being at war with myself if I ate more than I had planned

\- Thinking that I had do wait until I was thin to do certain things or wear certain clothes

\- Prioritizing weight loss over everything and obsessing about it

\- Constant food thoughts

I lost a fair bit of weight in my recent years (80lbs or so), I'm a 20yo man.

(context)  I went from what other people would probably call a 3 or 4 to.. maybe a  7? Idk girls ask me out, I'm 6'3 and slightly muscular even though I  hold some weight on my face.

Anyways,  all of my relationships, romantic and friendships (especially with  women) are completely different now. Even men treat me different, I get  picked for group projects, people ask me for advice, I'm just included  in the rest of the world when I wasn't before... Everything feels super  shallow, I went on tinder and got 20x my matches from when I first  tried, and it made me feel disgusted. Its like my entire value as a  person was down to my weight, or my weight stopped people from seeing  anything in value from me before. I went a date with an older friend  from a little after highschool and she made a comment  ""you're  completely *different*, it's so good\*"". I haven't changed since then, I just lost weight. Its still me\*.

It  sucks realizing that everyone who will be with you wouldn't give you  the time of day before, and would return to not giving you the time of  day if you gained it back. Dating feels so incredibly shallow, before I  lost the weight I blamed myself for being unsuccessful, and after losing  the weight I just see the worst in everyone.

0,"Long story short: I lost 70 lbs a few years ago, and over the last few months, regained back 20 of that. Back to being solidly ""overweight"".

So I have always wanted to donate my body to science when I die. Since I was a little kid and I found out about body farms and cadavers. As someone who doesn’t believe in god or an afterlife it seems like a great way to be useful and live on after death. 

Well guess what? If I were to die today I couldn’t be donated to any science programs. Most medical schools have a weight limit of 250 and height limit of 6” 4’. There is a body farm in my state that does go up to 300 but unfortunately I am just above that. This seriously broke my heart. I know it must seem silly for some to care about such a thing but for me its a massive deal. I don’t plan on making an early exit but If something did happen I want to know I could be used for good instead of just worm food.

0,"Hi! First post here! I'm female, almost 52, 5'4"" and my current weight is 166 lbs. I started at 238 lbs in March 2019 and my goal is to reach 140 lbs by the beginning of this September.

I found an unwavering motivation to deal with obesity and change my lifestyle permanently after receiving a diagnosis of mild non-alcoholic fatty liver 2 years ago. I spent my pandemic isolation (I live alone) making getting healthy my main focus. I read and watched a lot on the subject, and seriously focused on what I needed to change in my life. (I was also dealing with depression and anxiety at the time I began my journey).

My changes to date have been almost completely diet-related. I removed most processed food and all forms of sugar from my apartment. I cooked one-pot meals and froze them in individual portion sizes so something healthy was always available when I needed it. I made big multi-ingredient salads and kept them in the fridge to grab during the week. I switched to a diet of vegetables, whole grains, beans and legumes, fruit (mostly berries), all kinds of nuts and seeds, frozen and canned salmon, canned tuna, chicken and turkey (white meat), and sometimes extra-lean ground beef when I really wanted a hamburger! (I still haven't been able to open that tin of sardines, haha). I learned to bake whole grain bread. Anything I made was weighed for calories/portion size. I'm lactose intolerant and finally cut out dairy. I figured out which other types of foods were causing my IBS symptoms (also diagnosed in March 2019) and cut them, too. It was a process. I aimed to stay in a range of 1200-1500 calories a day and kept track of what I was eating in a food diary, especially to see where I was falling short nutrition-wise, and most of the time I needed to increase the number of veggies I ate. I didn't order anything from restaurants because I wanted to make sure I knew what I was eating. (I don't drink so I didn't need to consider that issue.) I also compiled a binder over time of healthy recipes I actually loved that I knew fit my caloric requirements. I take an Omega 3 supplement and much vitamin D3, as well as calcium if I don't drink enough non-dairy milk in a day to reach 1200 mg. Oh, I should also mention that many of the meals I cook are hot and spicy because for me it just makes eating healthy so much tastier!

The other important aspect has been positive self-regard. I have been gentle with myself and included the expectation that dips in my progress would be part of the process from the outset. If I plateaued, I just told myself that things would start to move again, and focused on eating healthy. If I felt like eating more I did, and I would literally say (out loud) to myself that 'of course you can have more food!'. After a while, my sugar cravings, which were A HUGE HUGE HUGE issue for me, disappeared. Visiting family for holidays etc. was (and is) a challenge but I'm so focused on my goal that I have been able to stay on my plan.

So the great news is -- I went for an ultrasound last week and my liver is now completely normal!  I am soooo happy and relieved! My new goal this spring is to gradually replace most of my calorie deficit with exercise so that I can eat an amount closer to a maintenance weight. I have started a walking/eventually running program, and have a goal to add weight training and some yoga later on.  I would really like to find a group I can go hiking with once group activities are allowed again! 

The last 2 years have been a time of major transition for me. This September, at the point at which I hope to reach my fat loss goal, I will be starting a research MA! So excited!! Although I'm 51, my lifestyle is definitely on par with that of a broke student but I love it. My depression is gone. If it returns, I'll continue to be gentle with myself. Anxiety will always be part of my life.

0,"And I was wrong. I'm 28F, 5'1"", and as of today, I weigh 187.8 pounds. I feel awful and hate the way I look. I have no energy or motivation for anything. I'm so upset with myself for letting it get this bad.

In 2017, I got up to my old HW of 174 pounds. I felt awful then and decided to start counting calories again and to go for more walks. Over the next couple of years, I very slowly lost around 30 pounds and felt great. I still wanted to lose some more weight to get into a healthy BMI and feel even better about myself, but I was really happy with my progress. I successfully lost weight and kept from gaining it back for around 2.5 years and I was certain I'd never see my HW ever again. But, as I'm sure is the case with many other people here, I could not predict the toll that a pandemic would take on my mental health and motivation.

I did pretty well for the first few months of the pandemic. I had gained a few pounds over Christmas and gained a few more going into the summer, but I was still exercising and trying to eat fairly normally. Around June or July, a switch flipped – perhaps that was the moment that it really sank in that the pandemic wasn't just going to go away in a few weeks. I went crazy, eating everything I'd ever craved and then some. I stopped counting calories after the numbers from my binges started to make me feel awful about myself. I stopped exercising, both out of laziness and out of fear of getting too close to other people outside. I kept telling myself I'd have one last day/weekend/week/month of binge eating and *then* I'd start over. I did this despite knowing that those thoughts are a trap and rarely turn out to be true. I did it all despite knowing that I'd end up where I am now, obese again and feeling worse about myself than I ever have before.

So here I am now, nearly 15 pounds above my last highest weight. Not only did I see those numbers again, but I surpassed them. As the scale has crept towards 190 pounds, I've realized that 200 isn't that far out of reach. I can hold a few cans of soup while standing on the scale and easily see 200 at the end of the day (I know because I tried). I always told myself that I'd never let myself get to this point no matter what – that if I ever neared 200, the numbers would be a wake-up call that made me turn my life around. It doesn't feel as clear-cut as I thought it would, almost like I've become numb to the numbers. Maybe it's just easier to see higher numbers when it's a slow rise from one day to the next. Either way, I'm not happy and I can't continue like this. My options are to either stay on my current path and end up morbidly obese and even more miserable, or to make changes now and work on being healthier.

Starting today, I'm tracking all my calories again. I'm going to ease into it – this week, I'm not going to stick to a budget so strictly, just track and notice the patterns. Next week, I'll start trying more seriously to stay under budget. It's the end of the day now, but I'm going to start going for walks again starting tomorrow. This is a big step for me – recently, I've been feeling so horrible about how I look now that I've been afraid to go out for walks in case someone sees me. But I know that's ridiculous. I know no one judges me as harshly as I judge myself and that the only way I can be active and feel better about myself again is to get back to the activity that I used to enjoy the most around a year ago. In a few weeks, I'll also start to incorporate some bodyweight workouts again. I'm going to cut out alcohol (which always makes me feel like crap anyway) and slowly start to cut down on processed foods.

I'm basically going to do everything I did last time. I think I did everything pretty well before. Losing the weight slowly through small changes is what made it so sustainable, and I believe it would have been sustainable long-term had the pandemic not happened. I felt like I could have sustained my lifestyle throughout any type of hardship, but, like most people, I didn't think something like the last year would even be possible.

I've had enough crisps, chocolate, pizza, McDonald's, and chips over the past year to last me a good long time. I'll still eat those foods occasionally, but I can definitely stand to stop eating them every day from here on out. Here's to the next weeks, months, and years ahead.

0,"I just pushed myself to go out for a walk and while on my walk there was a kid with someone and they yelled “fatty”. The person along with them told them “omg you’re so rude” and as I kept walking the kids voice echoed “fat fat fattyyyy!!” You never know what people are going through. I have no one to tell this to because everytime I’m fat shamed in public my mom thinks I’m lying or I’m exaggerating the situation. Yes I am fat and I’m trying my best to become healthy. I’ve been eating at home and cooking my own meals alongside trying to be more active.

I have no one to tell this to because everytime I’m fat shamed in public my mom thinks I’m lying or I’m exaggerating the situation. Yes I am fat and I’m trying my best to become healthy.

I was thinking breakfast for dinner next week. She ""snuck"" into the kitchen and in a super secret super noisy way fixed me a surprise. 

It was 2 pieces of toast with garlic salt and birthday cake waffles with cool whip and extra seasoning (also garlic salt- so much garlic salt) the plate was only complete with a smattering of goldfish (also extra seasoned with garlic salt) around it to make it look like a four leaf clover for luck. 🥰

So... today isnt going ideal as far as my diet and my calories and my IF. I mean I could make adjustments to make it work later on, but I am not. My heart is as full as my belly right now. And I think it's important to learn  remember balance. 

I loved my garlic salt waffles even if it wasnt what I expected to need this morning. So instead of the 60 day streak accountability post I was debating, I'm just gonna remember to slow down and enjoy it a bit too.

The first time I cried at a doctor's office was when I was 12 years old and the doctor told me that the darkened skin on my neck and inner elbows was a warning sign for developing diabetes. She was very kind and offered me helpful solutions to get my weight under control but I was terrified to think that the disease that killed my grandma might be in my future. A pattern developed after that: I'd go to the doctor, be told that my weight was dangerous and I was getting sicker, I'd try to lose weight, be successful for a while, and then go back to old habits. Rinse and repeat.

It wasn't until I was about 22 or 23 that it finally hit me that I was headed down a dangerous path. I'd reached 400 pounds, was pre diabetic, my blood pressure was climbing, and I had sleep apnea. I knew within a year, maybe less, I'd be diabetic, on blood pressure medication, and using a CPAP machine. And I was in my early 20s! Funnily enough, as much as I had grown to hate doctors, it was doctors that ended up scaring me enough to take charge of my health.

I had gastric bypass when I was 24 years old. I completely changed my lifestyle, started counting my calories, exercising, and working closely with a dietitian and exercise trainer. My hard work paid off and two and a half years later I'm down 276 pounds.

I had my first doctor's appointment last week since reaching my goal weight and for the first time I wasn't scared. I wasn't uncomfortable. I wasn't ashamed. The MA put the blood pressure cuff on my arm, saw the 110/60 and said ""wow, that's really good."" I stepped on the scale and wasn't brought to tears by the weight that popped up. The doctor felt around my abdomen and said ""I thought your liver might be a bit enlarged but it's not, you're just so skinny now."" The lab technician drew my blood and instead of having to to poke me five times because my arms were so covered in fat and I was dehydrated, she got me easily on the first try, said my blood was flowing really well because of how hydrated I was, and made a comment about my ""teeny tiny arm"" when she was wrapping me up. My blood tests came back and everything is normal. 

Sure, I enjoy the way I look now. I like how I feel in smaller clothes. But the greatest gift I've given myself is the gift of health. I'm no longer afraid of diseases or dying as a result of my weight. I know I have a long life ahead of me and this doctor's appointment has helped me take a hard look at my accomplishments, which I don't do enough.

0,"Hi everyone, I’ve been working out for 8 weeks now, 7 days a week. My workouts are usually 30 mins of strength training and 30 minutes of HIIT training on my peloton. In the last 54 days I have had around 6 rest days, some of which were active recovery (going for a long work or a leisure cycle or some yoga). I was sick with sinusitis and still worked out.  

In this time I’ve eaten between 1700-2000 calories, the past 3 weeks have been closer to 2000 calories because I’m getting kind of annoyed with everything and I’m adopting a little bit of a fuck it mentality because I’m frustrated. 

In this time I have definitely gotten stronger, I am beating personal bests, I’ve developed mad determination but I haven’t achieved ANY fat loss. I have some silly body fat scale (we know how inaccurate those things can be), I have apparently lost 3% body fat, gained 3kg of muscle and my visceral fat has gone down from 10 to 7. The scale has shifted from 82 to 80.5 in 8 weeks. Not even 4lbs? All these stats sound great but my waist measurement has not changed by one inch and I still look exactly the same, I feel stronger and I am breaking personal records but my body has not changed. 

I’m only trying to lose the last 10kg and with intense daily exercise my maintenance cals should be around 2500, even in my “bad” 2k cal day should still result in a deficit. Im very endowed in the boob area which does feel a little lighter but apart from that nothing has changed even with all my hard work and I’m now getting to a really dark place. I didn’t even have the initial fast weight loss people get, what is wrong with my body? 

I’m on the brink of pulling my hair out and I know there are some really knowledgable people in this community. My stats are 22F, 80.5kg, 174cm (5’8.5). BFP: 26.6%. BMI is 26. Bone mass is Waist is 33 inches. Trying to lose 10kg of fat the right way which is why I’m making sure I’m doing strength to maintain/gain muscle while I lose fat.

Dieting alone won't cut it. If you want to maintain your weight you need to make small changes in your life so that calories in = calories out. If you want to lose weight go on a diet. 

Easier said than done but I have found that dieting alone is not enough. I focus a lot more of my energy on my lifestyle than regularly going on diets now. That being said, I always go on a diet for the month of January so I can enjoy Christmas!

Now, I'm in a healthy weight range. On the last ten pounds. Holy hell, this past month...the inability to feel satiated. It's unlike anything I've had while dieting now or in the past. I've implemented diet breaks throughout my process, however, now even that isn't helping. I'm wondering if I need to make them last longer, maybe instead of 3-5 days, 7-10? Those have been helpful mentally and getting rid of this in the past, but now, not so much.

I mean, seriously. I had a couple of bad days I just...I ate good fats, fiber and protein, higher volume food, and still after 3-4k+ calories (need around 2300 to maintain) it wasn't enough. I still found myself fixating about food as if I had just ran 20 miles and hadn't eaten in two days. I drink plenty of water, with my activity level a gallon a day on average. I also have been doing IF.

So, I'm lost. Is...is this life now? I can't imagine maintaining like this. Coping before wasn't great but still fairly easy eating the right things. Yeah, a twinge of hunger here and there but that is to be expected. I genuinely can't describe what it has become, other than the bane of my existence and the most annoying shit ever. Has anyone else gone through this, after getting to/close to a healthy weight range or after dieting for so long? I figure one of those is the culprit, but I don't know.

because I wasn't feeling it, I felt tired,stressed,nervous, anxious. Etc.
 And these things make me feel weak like I haven't archived anything,and that just brings me down a lot. At the end I got myself together and did the workout and im proud of myself, because I feel great now.💪🏽😁

0,"This is a 'weekly' post for the Runners of LoseIt. 

All  levels of runners are welcome -- from brand new first timers to experienced marathoners. Please feel free to come in and share, ask questions, whine, post NSVs (non-scale victories), etc. There are a lot  of great runners on this sub and lots of experience and help to share.  Plus, it is also more fun to share regularly how you are doing with  others going through the same challenges and experiences.

This post is mostly for sharing details of running this week, your first run, running related NSVs, questions, PRs, etc.

In  addition I will ramble on about some topic that is helpful to runners,  usually new runners, to help people along. This week -- running gear!

Running Gear

You really don't need much to go for a run, but there's a lot to be gained by adding a few running equipment, accessories, and tech. There's all sorts of things you can bring along on a run --

* Phone (and keys) Holder/Belt
* Headphones
* Watch or Tracker
* Heart Rate Monitor
* Stride/Form tech
* Running Power Meter

I'm going to talk about the top four items via my own choices. I've not widely tested any of this stuff, but I have arrived at stuff I really like and make running better for me. 

# Phone Holder - Amphipod Airflow

[https://www.amphipod.com/products/holders/music/electronics/airflow-endurance](https://www.amphipod.com/products/holders/music/electronics/airflow-endurance)

I know, I know, it's fanny-pack-esque. But it has all the following things going for it -- 

* Holds a Phone + Keys + Credit Card/Money - ample, secure storage. 
* Hides easily under my shirt - It lays flat. I've tucked it under my shirt or in my shorts without issue.
* Adjustable  - set it to a point where it stays put and I will not budge for hours. 
* Comfortable - The elastic is wide and stretchy, never pinches. 
* Durable - mine is still going strong after 4+ years. 
* Reasonably priced.

# Headphones - Panasonic RP-HJE120-D Wired Ear Buds - Orange

[https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/dp/B003ELYQGG](https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/dp/B003ELYQGG)

* Cheap - $USD 9. 
* High Quality sound
* Different ear piece sizes for perfect fit
* Lots of great/fun colors -- like my favorite orange. 

I love music when I run. I enjoy solid sound quality, and like to turn it up nice and loud with excellent base. I've tried Bluetooth earbuds and they either work well, but are expensive (and I lose/break them in no time). Or, they are cheap and disconnect or have sound quality issues. Also, I don't need another thing to charge. I'm fine with wired ones but I know many aren't. I wear my wired ones with the wire running under my shirt. It can be bother when I am completely drenched with sweat -- but then again, I'm completed drenched at that point. 

I listen to music off an iPod Nano. It sounds great and is easy to operated on a run. It's light enough that it is not an issue in my pocket. I sometimes run sans phone -- so I can't use it for music reliably. 

# Watch/Tracker - Polar Vantage M

[https://www.polar.com/us-en/vantage/m](https://www.polar.com/us-en/vantage/m)

Polar is in the pack of second-runners in the running watch tech space after Garmin. I started with Polar and I've stuck with it. I like the Flow website and the simple, sport specific design of the product. 

Why do I like it -- 

* Ease of use - start a workout with a press and hold of a button most of the time. 
* Lots of sports profiles - I've used Running, Hiking, Walking, Indoor Rowing, Yoga, and Strength Training in the last 30 days. I've used 20 or so sports profiles over the last four years. 
* 5+ days on a charge. I hate charging stuff all the time. Nearly a week per charge is great for me. 
* Building workouts like Intervals/Repeats are easy and fast.
* Provide workout ideas if I am don't have a plan for the day -- suggests running more, strength training, or flexibility/core/support workouts and then provides the details and timing right on the watch. 
* Built in Running Training Plans for 5K, 10K, Half, Marathon. 
* Great support. I've had my Polar Watches have issues and got a free/hassle free replacements with what appears to be a new watch. 

If I had an Apple Watch I likely would use that over this but I enjoy the sport-centric nature of the Polar. 

# Heart Rate Monitor - Polar Chest Strap

[https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/h10\_heart\_rate\_sensor](https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/h10_heart_rate_sensor)

Chest heart rate monitors are way more stable than most other options. My one other go to is an arm (not wrist based) optical strap like the Polar OH1/2 Verity. But optical trackers are slow to track to your heart rate from my experiences. The chest strap is fast and tracks way quicker. 

There's lots of great choices in chest straps from Garmin and Wahoo and others.

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to** r/Loseit!

&amp;#x200B;

So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why you’re overweight

&amp;#x200B;

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before You Start

&amp;#x200B;

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tracking

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

&amp;#x200B;

# Creating Your Deficit

&amp;#x200B;

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Exercise

&amp;#x200B;

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Crawl, Walk, Run

&amp;#x200B;

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Acceptance

&amp;#x200B;

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.

I 25 F 5ft 3inches SW 237.6lbs CG 185lbs just weighed in at 226lbs . I didnt lose anything physically but mentally iv had break throughs this week.






Il explain why not losing anything isnt a big deal its one week . i will lose weight hopefully next week i will but im relaxed about it . Mainly as its a lifestyle change not a race .






Its not a big deal as iv had a couple break throughs the last week that kinda just hit me . I want to share as im fcking proud of myself .





1) I broke up with feeling guilty about thinking , wanting , craving , making and eating/not eating . Im not going to feel guilty bout it anymore as its pointless . I have to eat to live  its how humans fuel our bodys its that simple . But i want to enjoy food again eat what i like , love and crave with no guilt so i if i want cake il track it and amend my day to fit it in as why not . 





2) I realised i have created routine in my life of being a housewife ( not married tho ) .

[March 2021:](https://i.imgur.com/DtLCnas.jpg) [98.5kg/216.7lbs](https://i.imgur.com/49SArMS.jpg) 

Today is my anniversary of when I first got serious with dieting and losing weight, so I thought it would be a good idea to share my journey so far and the lessons I've learnt over the last 6 years. Before I saw success though I struggled with losing weight for over 5 years, always having bursts of motivation to act or grand fantasies of impossible situations occurring that would fix my problems. Diets never lasted more than a week. 

In March 2015, after some challenging goals in my life turned out not so hard to accomplish, I decided to try losing weight for longer than a week. As each week passed I progressively got more involved in the process; starting using MyFitnessPal, clean eating, no soda and signed up to a gym. It was surreal and I thought I was unstoppable. 

In the 8 months of losing 40kg/88lbs I had been extremely strict on myself, so strict that food was not enjoyable. There was no creativity or variance, I was just on the grind waiting to reach my goal weight with weekly weigh-ins and my food logging streak keeping me in check. So inevitably it all started to fall apart.

The first big hit was losing my 180 day streak on MyFitnessPal. Next I was just slowly adding back soda into my diet, not sugar free but the full stuff. After that I stumbled and started to yoyo between 106kg/233lbs and 110kg/242lbs, and slowly and surely the difference got higher and it became harder to bring myself to lose weight again. I eventually stopped weighing myself and started to slowly reintroduce all the bad food I had deprived myself of. It snowballed, slowly undoing all the good that I had done. It then reached a point where I stopped caring and I ballooned to 158kg/348lbs by August 2018. Nowhere during this point of time did I address my core issues with food and what I used it for, nor did I really know at the time what those issues were.  

Come one Saturday morning in August after having a 7 day streak ordering takeout I weighed myself and saw 157.9kg/348lbs and I knew I never wanted to see myself ever reach 160kg/352lbs and again picked myself up and started trying to lose weight again. Steeling myself and fought through the inner turmoil and torture of failing at something I had previously succeeded in. Parents were worried as they saw the patterns, this was just another “burst of motivation” and in a week I’d be back to old habits. But I went beyond a week, then it was a month and by Nov 2018 I was down to 144kg/317lbs

However I was just repeating what failed before, I had gone back to old tactics when I lost that 14kg/31lbs. No Soda, No Takeout, No Fun. So when a small vacation happened in November 2018 where there would be takeout, soda and fun I was hit with a dilemma. I came to a decision to just enjoy myself for the couple days away and get back on task after it. However that never happened and I fell again and just like that I was on my way back to 158kg/348lbs. By mid-February 2019 I was 147kg/323lbs, doomed to be in this never ending loop till I had an epiphany; Why was I trying so hard? Why was I trying to be perfect at losing this weight? It was clearly failing. Why don’t I just take it slow?

March and the anniversary of starting this back in 2015 was fast approaching and I had the brilliant idea of competing with my former self but I knew I couldn’t be as strict, I knew I had to take this easy. So I tried losing weight with as little stress as possible. I guesstimated calories, tried to eat within 2,000 kcal a day and never went stupid. Kept a cheat meal once a week so I could still enjoy takeout, started to weigh myself weekly and I still allowed myself to drink diet soda, keeping vices that made each day bearable.  

I then lost 20kg/44lbs in a comfortable 23 weeks, losing about ~0.9kg/2lbs each week. My first roadblock was week 24 where I didn’t gain or lose anything, while this deterred me I knew I wasn’t trying my hardest and knew what I could do for results. I double downed, started counting calories again with the LoseIt App and tried to find out what went wrong. Over the next 2 weeks weight loss resumed till I stumbled into another problem. I found I was eating too much of my budget for breakfast/lunch and didn’t feel satisfied with what I had remaining for dinner. This is when I tried out intermediating fasting. I did a 16:8 split and it helped me budget out each meal and allowed me to dip my toes into meal prepping. This roughly lasted 6 weeks before I went on holidays. I was sad to break the schedule but after the vacation I felt I had learnt the lessons I needed and stopped fasting. 

After coming back from vacation this time and going overboard with food I expected to see a weight increase but surprisingly didn’t. This gave me some ideas and got me into researching “re-feeds”. The outcome was a refeed once a month where I had no calorie limited, I didn’t count the calories of the day and a day where I could go stupid and try and satiate any of the cravings I had been having the past month. These refeeds aligned with board game nights with mates and made it so I could enjoy good company and good food at the same time without regret. What made me start doing these was realizing that there was no deadline to losing the weight, there was no reason why I couldn’t just enjoy myself for a day. At worst it would set me back a week at most and in the grand scheme of things that's nothing. 

By the end of 2019 I had matched my personal best of 106.3kg and was ready to embark into uncharted territory until Christmas holidays set me back 3kg/6.6lbs….however instead of getting deterred I problem solved and saw what I could change or add....I had been squandering my gym membership, which I had been still paying for monthly since 2015...It was then, 5 days out from the new years, where I started a dumbbell full body workout routine. I increased my calories to 2,000/day and every other day I’d workout. 

I’ve done my best to work out at least 3 times a week and all I can think is I should have started earlier. Working out has been incredible. Between the post workout feeling, being able to eat more, better quality sleep, waking up being easier and just feeling better has been so surreal. Watching my arms get bigger, feeling stronger and seeing my man boobs transition from saggy tits to actual pecs has been insane. I made an incredibly smart decision by buying adjustable weight dumbbells and a bench before the pandemic hit that allowed me to explore the wonders of weight lifting. Right now I’m enjoying low weight, high rep push/pull body workouts with low rest time and doing my best to avoid leg day due to working in a job that has me on my feet for 6hrs at a time. I won’t get too into what I do for exercise besides that due to how limited my knowledge is, but will list some books and resources that helped me at the end of this post. 

Covid finally caught up to me in [mid-2020](https://i.imgur.com/ocAtkNO.png) when I went for a holiday at home during June, I was at my lowest ever of 97.6kg before this and just lost motivation and sight of my goals (mainly due to losing myself in a mmo). History was repeating itself and what unraveled my success back in 2015 was going to happen again as I ended the year at 106.6kg, this terrified me. To combat this I used the power of a new years resolution to kick myself back awake and I attempted a 30 day challenge to remain on task. This involved daily weigh-ins to keep me accountable, a new gym workout routine and being back on a 16:8 split intermediate fast. The 30 day challenge only lasted 22 days due to a holiday but it was enough to get me back on task.

Currently I’m back on being relaxed about dieting. I’m not tracking my calories but generally know how much I can eat a day. Speaking of eating, I despise food prep. I hate having to think about what I have to eat, spend time acquiring the ingredients and cooking it up. The early parts of dieting was all about finding quick things to make but even that got tedious. I solved this by paying the premium and have a weekly subscription to a meals service (mymusclechef) that gives me 12 meals/week, 2 meals/day and a day off for a cheat meal, these meals cost around $10 AUD each and average around 550 calories per meal. Breakfast was solved with a 300~ calorie breakfast bar and then later replaced with oats. I still have my vices of too many Pepsi max cans a day and 1 250~300ml can of full sugar energy drink. I then augment my day with a whey protein milkshake and some packaged snacks, usually aiming for around 160~180g total protein/day. 

Example Day:  

Breakfast: 450 calories~

- Protein Bar/Cooked Oats with milk + Energy Drink 

Lunch: 500~600 calories

- My muscle chef meal
- Can of Pepsi max (1~3 calorie diet soda)

Dinner: 500~600 calories

- My muscle chef meal
- Can of Pepsi max (1~3 calorie diet soda)

Snacks: 400~500 calories

- Whey protein shake
- Cheese and Crackers on the go/assorted packaged snack
- Can of Pepsi max (1~3 calorie diet soda)

So this is about 1850~2150 calories, maybe peaking towards 2300. With how much I exercise I could probably get away with eating more. Ideally I should be cutting out the soda and energy drinks but I keep my vices to prevent myself from going insane, I don’t drink alcohol so I have room in my health budget for things that aren't good for me. In addition I have a Vitamin D, Omega3 and multivitamin supplement. What I listed here is what I found best works for me after years of experimenting and now I have a diet that I enjoy, can consistently do every day and is malleable for change. A cheat meal day usually replaces the two muscle chef meals and the rest is the same.  

In closing, the real challenge I faced losing weight is the mental strain and burden that one goes through when losing weight. To me, food was an avenue of escapism, when life got too hard to handle, food was there with its warm embrace to make me feel good even if temporarily. It got to the point where I even started feeling at ease after I ordered takeout. While what I’ve written are the things I did to help lose weight it hasn’t expressed the mental battle within myself that has taken place and still takes place to this day. I’ve been to the darkest parts of my mind twice and managed to pull myself out of it, the second time was a damn miracle but that inner voice inside my head wouldn’t shut up about wanting to keep trying, and that’s what I did. I kept trying. I took 12 years of trying but I eventually found my way. 

Rules I've incorporated into my life.  

1. Don't view dieting as punishment. I still have vices such as an energy drink and a couple cans of Pepsi Max a day. 
2. Strive for consistency over perfection. Don't let a bad weigh-in day halt or revert progress, same goes for blowing your calorie budget or moments of weakness. A 1-day set back is nothing.  Don’t be defined by the mistakes you make. 
3. Think about it everyday. Meal prep, gym, logging. I weigh in daily now to always keep myself accountable.  
4. Make time for cheat meals (1/week) and cheat days (1/month). Allow yourself to enjoy all types of foods. 
5. Don't set deadlines for goals: Losing weight is already stressful as is and if you find yourself not on ""schedule"" to be a set weight at a set point in time it just leads to unnecessary stress or worse, punishing yourself to try and reach that goal. Making your goal weight a week or two later isn't the end of the world.
6. Diet is forever, what you are doing now is what you’ll be doing at your goal weight. So find something that works, is comfortable and malleable. 
7. Make time to workout, it's literally the greatest thing ever.

The weight loss has been so slow—almost 6 months, and it’s so hard for me to stay motivated when I’m eating under 2,000 calories, mostly fruits and veggies, no processed foods, lots of water, and working out an hour a day (weights and cardio!) I feel like I’m doing everything right, but I’m burning out and I still have the dreaded chubby belly even though I can lift heavy and run for 6 miles without breaking a sweat. Does anyone have tips? Things that worked for those last 10 lbs?"

0,"I can’t believe how thoughtless and mindless I’ve been about food in the past. Eating cold food off my sons’ plates. Stuffing handfuls of chips in before anyone could see.

Tonight I went to my mom’s house to see my brother before he goes into rehab tomorrow. I have two sons (2 and 6) and they kept me really busy running around and feeding them, etc. I was also more into spending time with my brother and family and didn’t even eat the pizza that my family had bought. I had eaten some homemade chicken curry and cauliflower rice before heading over but definitely had room for pizza.. but the situation just wasn’t worth it. I’d literally have to just shove a slice in my mouth because I was constantly chasing after my kids. I thought about how planning for a more indulgent meal (like the pizza) that fits into my calorie goals while I’m with my husband watching a movie sounded sooo much more worth the splurge than this situation would allow. 

It’s getting easier to make these decisions and to realize that food isn’t going anywhere. No one noticed I didn’t eat the pizza because we were busy. On the flip side, my brother had stopped by with cupcakes a few weeks ago and I had one with my kids and brother and dad and took my time and savored it because I could and because it was a sweet sentiment.

My journey started about five months ago when I finally landed my first “real” job. I finished up my masters last year and was lucky enough to get a fulltime analyst position despite everything going on with covid. Landing said new job finally allowed me to take control of my shopping, my diet, and ultimately my health.

From a very young age, probably around 10 or so, I’ve been overweight. I’ve previously tried dieting and had some success back in 10th grade. I went from 275 down to 225 in one summer. However I didn’t learn anything about cooking or forming better eating habits and I quickly gained it all back when I stopped following the strict dieting book I was given. Because of this experience, I knew I had to approach things differently this time. Dieting wasn’t the answer, I needed to change my relationship with food, understand what was and wasn’t good for me, and form realistic and sustainable habits that would also enable me to lose weight. Put more simply, my mantra this go around is “developing sustainable habits, not dieting!”

Back to the journey! With my newfound financial freedom and control of my food, I started by replacing unhealthy food choices with healthier options, i.e., instead of having two sandwiches with some chips at lunch I would have two sandwiches with a side salad, and then I moved on to having just one sandwich with some fruit and a side salad, etc. I kept making small changes like this for most of November but I wasn’t keeping track of calories or anything like that, just trying to alter the way I ate and the foods that I ate. At the beginning of December, I started noticing that my clothes were feeling a bit looser—things I had no longer been able to wear suddenly fit again. This inspired me to finally weigh myself and make things ‘official’. On December 11th, I got on the scale and damn near died from what I saw. I was expecting to be in the 270-280 range given that it was my previous highest weight and surely I didn’t think I could be above that. But, as you probably noticed by the SW at the top, I was a whopping 311! This was a major turning point for me. I become very depressed for a few nights then that depression quickly turned to anger—anger at myself for letting things get so bad—and then ultimately the anger turned into motivation.

With my depression/anger induced motivation in hand, I decided it was time to take things up a notch. I started looking into resources on how to change my diet, lose weight, etc. which is how I ended up finding this subreddit. Ultimately, I knew CICO was the way to go for me. I invested in a food scale, downloaded MyFitnessPal, and went to work. Since December 25th, just two weeks after I wanted to give up, I have weighed myself every single day to capture my weight trends and logged every single meal I have had. I’ve had weeks where I didn’t lose any weight, I’ve had days and meals where I broke and ate food I know I shouldn’t have, but I have stuck with it despite any obstacles and now I’m down 36 pounds in less than three months! Seeing my weight in the 270’s again, and soon to be 260’s, is really helping me learn to love myself again. My confidence is skyrocketing and my motivation is at an all time high!

My journey started about five months ago when I finally landed my first “real” job. I finished up my masters last year and was lucky enough to get a fulltime analyst position despite everything going on with covid. Landing said new job finally allowed me to take control of my shopping, my diet, and ultimately my health.

From a very young age, probably around 10 or so, I’ve been overweight. I’ve previously tried dieting and had some success back in 10th grade. I went from 275 down to 225 in one summer. However I didn’t learn anything about cooking or forming better eating habits and I quickly gained it all back when I stopped following the strict dieting book I was given. Because of this experience, I knew I had to approach things differently this time. Dieting wasn’t the answer, I needed to change my relationship with food, understand what was and wasn’t good for me, and form realistic and sustainable habits that would also enable me to lose weight. Put more simply, my mantra this go around is “developing sustainable habits, not dieting!”

Back to the journey! With my newfound financial freedom and control of my food, I started by replacing unhealthy food choices with healthier options, i.e., instead of having two sandwiches with some chips at lunch I would have two sandwiches with a side salad, and then I moved on to having just one sandwich with some fruit and a side salad, etc. I kept making small changes like this for most of November but I wasn’t keeping track of calories or anything like that, just trying to alter the way I ate and the foods that I ate. At the beginning of December, I started noticing that my clothes were feeling a bit looser—things I had no longer been able to wear suddenly fit again. This inspired me to finally weigh myself and make things ‘official’. On December 11th, I got on the scale and damn near died from what I saw. I was expecting to be in the 270-280 range given that it was my previous highest weight and surely I didn’t think I could be above that.

0,"Hi loseit.  I've been hanging out with the OMAD (one meal a day) guys and been on keto diet for 4.5 months and absolutely crushing it.  I'm 31M 5'8 and was 200 pounds in October. I currently weigh 166 and have a goal weight of 160.  I've had an interesting battle with my weight since I was a kid, and won't go into too many details, but I have been as heavy as 225 at my worst in highschool and college, 145 pounds at my skinniest when I was around 25, and got back to 200 during quarantine.

I've been in great shape doing crossfit at 170 pounds, skinny fat shape (hello, this is me), and also just fat fat.

I have never been able to get rid of my midsection - it causes me to hyper focus on it and the more weight I lose honestly the more body image issues I get and I have struggled in the past with disordered eating to try and maintain weight as I went crazy when the scale started going up.

This is me getting started again in October 2020

I feel great, my face gains are crazy, and my clothes actually fit again.  I feel and look younger.  I personally get frustrated looking at these pictures though as all I want to criticize is my lower stomach, and every time I'm shirtless in front of a mirror I am staring constantly at my midsection. My girlfriend thinks I get vain when I lose weight, but in reality I'm just staring at my belly.  I dislike how much my ribs show and in general just what my silhouette looks like, especially when part of me looks under weight and the other part I still see my 200 pound body.  

I have put in years of effort and have definitely gained, lost, and regained my entire body weight over the last 10 years as my weight has fluctuated.  It is so frustrating to never have been happy with my body as a teen or adult, and also feeling like I've done permanent damage to myself when I got fat as a kid.  

I guess my question is if this is REALLY this important to me do I need to finally just have a consultation with a plastic surgeon, or is there something I can do that will finally correct this?  Would this be skin removal, or is it stubborn belly fat?  I have seen before/afters of people who were 300+ pounds and their skin/stomach doesn't look like mine - maybe my skin just isn't as elastic as others.

I have been what I would consider underweight at 145 pounds chasing a flat stomach that I want and I just can't seem to get there no matter what I do.  I am approaching my 160 pound goal weight, and I couldn't be happier with my results and my health, but I seriously am so hyper focused on my belly and love handles and once in my life I'd like to have something closer to my ""ideal"" body.

I've lost about 70lbs while working from home this year and now that my office is getting ready to go back, I'm hyper-aware of the fact that I'm going to have to deal with the ""You've lost weight"" conversation at scale when I see my colleagues for the first time.

The chances of them not bringing up a visibly different weight is very slim to none.)

What's an easy way to acknowledge the comment while opening the door to quickly move on from it? I'm really uncomfortable talking about my weight and I'm dreading the thought.

Additionally, how do you answer ""What did you do to lose weight?"" I feel like that always comes with so many follow up questions and I really want to avoid that.

0,"Hi! I really need advice on losing weight that I had initially lost but unfortunately regained. I (21F) am 4'11 and I currently weigh 128lbs. My heaviest was 165lbs in 2017 and in March of 2020, I was 113lbs. I was super proud because my goal weight is 110lbs. 

I managed to maintain the 113lbs until October 2020. This is when another lockdown happened in my city so gyms closed and I lost my job. Also, the weather started getting cold and I didn't want to go outside because I HATE cold weather. I basically started sitting at home all day, everyday. Around this time I started steadily gaining weight until Feb 2021 when I reached 129lbs. I'm so devastated. I went out and bought some dumbbells, kettlebells, jump rope, ab roller, etc. so I could start working out at home. 

In Feb, I started working out for 30-60 minutes a day/4-5 days a week. So far, I see a big difference in my glutei (which I'm very happy about lol) but I have not lost a single pound. I don't understand how that is even possible. Maybe I am eating more than I think but I just don't understand what happened to my body. I feel like even if I eat one cookie, I gain weight. It's so discouraging for me when I feel like I had a great week in terms of working out and eating well, but then I weigh myself and nothing has changed. I used to have a bad relationship with the scale 2 years ago as I would literally weigh myself 3 times a day. I don't want to go back to obsessing over numbers and starving myself eating 800 calories a day, but I keep thinking about how badly I just want the weight to be gone. I lost the weight before but I feel like this time is 100x harder and I cannot figure out why. It's really starting to affect my life as I hate leaving the house because I don't want people to see me.

January I started Keto. While I feel better on Keto. Had one cheat day in almost 2 months on Keto I felt horrible afterwards. Not mentally because I cheated, but physically. 

I’m glad that I’m down almost 21 pounds and feeling a little bit better over all. But so depressed at how much more weight I have to lose and at how long it may take. 

I lost an over all average of just a little over 1 pound per week. Which is a healthy weight loss. I have just a little over 50 more pounds to go to reach my ultimate goal weight. 

The last several weeks I tend to lose close to an average of half a pound per week. I’m cutting back my calories. Watching what I eat and trying my best to be more active. But still I’m dropping the pounds ever so slow. 

I think about if I could lose just 2 pounds per week. Which is a lot, but that would mean almost 6 months and then I’d be at my ultimate goal weight finally. While 6 months feels like a long time, it’s not too bad. 

But if I continue to lose close to half a pound per week. I won’t get there until almost 2 years from now. To be stuck at a weight I feel uncomfortable with for 2 more years. Feels like forever.

I’m hoping I can gain some discipline and look and feel healthy again. This post I feel will also hold me a bit more accountable. Wish me luck.

I am 25, female, and started going back to the gym about two months ago. 5’5, started at 180 pounds three months ago. Now at 172.9. 

I have been eating with a 500 deficit. I burn about 2400-2500 a day and I try to eat around 2000 a day. I also have been lifting heavy and getting in cardio 6 days a week. I also get at least 100grams of protein from my food every day. 

Somehow my muscle mass decreased and my body fat increased, according to the body scanners at the gym. I am just very frustrated and feeling very defeated. 

I also don’t drink at all, I am a vegetarian but mostly eat vegan because of my lactose intolerance. 

I feel crushed thinking I have been doing so good because my clothes are getting loser and I look like I am losing weight. Which I have been, but apparently it’s been unhealthy!

What am I doing wrong!!! Truly any advice would be great.

0,"I'm 296 pounds, 5'11, 27 year old male. Chronic stress. Little exercise. I've been eating like total shit (and a lot of it) since I was in high school pretty much (15-16). High sugar, high sodium. Every single day pretty much, outside of a few days and a couple of weeks here and there where I get inspired. I get minor chest pains and have really high blood pressure (doctor put me on lisinopril a year ago and I've been taking it everyday since). Never had a heart attack as far as I can tell (though two weeks ago I had some minor left hand pain that radiated up my arm the next day, but it went away after a couple of days, and there was another situation a few months ago where I played basketball for the first time in years and stretched really hard and this led to some really bad chest pain that night, but it went away the next day. Could it have been a muscle?), and amazingly I don't think I have diabetes. My doctor has done blood work but never brought it up, so at least I don't think I do. Can I come back from this if I start eating right today? I was wishy-washy suicidal before which is why let myself go for so long.

I have a lot of plans now but I worry that the damage is done and I won't live very long after what I've done. Can morbidly obese people come back from a long spell like this and live fairly long lives? I honestly just want to see 50. I know nothing in life is guaranteed and I might get hit by a car tomorrow but I'm at that point where I wonder if it's worth it if I've fucked myself up too bad. Know what I mean? I'm still gonna do it for honor's sake but I want to know from someone here if I'm too far gone and how many years I possibly could have shaved off my life living this way. (And I know everyone's body is different but I want to hear from people that were in similar situations and left this bullshit years and years behind them)

0,"So I've been losing weight quite well, nearly 2 stone off since I started, but there's something that's been annoying me so much.



I currently weigh 100kg, my goal weight is 58. Giving myself 3 years to do it. Lose half my body weight.

Seems pretty reasonable, keep at 1600-1700 kcal a day. All of that is fine it's good...


But fuck!


I already have skin that isn't as tight anymore. I know I'm going to end up with loose skin Covering me and it's so demoralising!! I want to look good, I'll be honest that's my goal. If my goal was to be healthy I'd want to lose less weight and spread it over 7-9 years.


I want so badly to still be in my mid twenties and be thin and look good and be able to post thirst traps and fuck it I know that's not what I'm meant to say right I'm meant to say oh I'm only doing this for my health, or I know I look good at any weight, or loose skin doesn't bother me, but it does!!!


The losing weight, the exercise, I love it. Diet is going great. Hell even if I get surgery that doesn't scare me or anything like scars, but it's the COST. It's that in order to look good after years of childhood obesity which lead to medication caused weight gain, I now not only have to put in a fuck tonne of work to even be healthy, but to actually fucking look it I'm gonna need to shell out so much money... I don't even know how I'll pay for it! I don't know if I ever can! The reality of looking good might be nonexistent for me!!


People are into fit people, people are into fat people, I know. But I know I am so so much happier seeing myself overweight and looking good than loose skin. Not that it looks bad on other people, that's not my point, or that it's intrinsically bad to have it, it's not it's fucking impressive and shows how far someone's come. But it's not what I want to see in the mirror after all this work. And I fucking hate how unfair this all is.

3) I am a vegetarian so I eat eggs, paneer and Pulses and rice but even then I don't feel full.  Am I eating too low and not losing weight? 

4) I step on the scale every day and it's just super frustrating to neither see weightloss, nor inch loss.

I have been going through a rough two years knew I was gaining weight (I was 120 in 2019) but I didn’t think I weighed that much, it also leaves me on the obese side of the BMI.
So basically I’m trying to get back to my old weight
So I started myself on a strict 1000 cal diet which includes a majority of lean protein, leafy greens, vegetables
I’m staying away from carbs, salt, butter and alcohol, sweets also but I have never been much of a sweet tooth anyway.
One of problems areas is exercise, I used to be able to run 5 miles and thought I could just jump right back into that but I am out of breath after 30 seconds jump roping so I’m clearly not in shape and now despise doing anything with exercise
So if anyone has any advice for me im desperate!!
Also would love to hear some of your success stories to help motivate me!
I was also wondering how fast you think it would take to start seeing any weight loss

I never ever EVER posted on here. Never really been a part of the community at all. Honestly, the only posts I've ever read were on nosleep and that's just because a friend would recommend it.

My story, as it goes. I'm 27. And a half. My parents were married at this age and pregnant with me. I just think about it from time to time. How I still am not doing what I want to be doing because I keep postponing it with one excuse after the other.

I graduated from university a while ago. Said goodbye to my friends, who live all around the world. Could hardly meet up with them before this whole shebang, imagine now.

My area of expertise has nothing to do with what I've wanted to do since the age of 7. Plus, it's like...impossible to get a job without another specialization.

I left my job in November. No, please, rejoice for me. It was an unbearable situation where I was given the responsibilities of an owner without the perks. So, underpaid, underappreciated, and overworked. They still like me. Met them in the street the other day.

I left because I made the decision to go back to get an MSc, despite my first degree being in languages. So, got a lot to study for. I also got another job three days after I left the other one.

I haven't had a break since 2016.

I've always been a little chubby. Not recognizably so, I was just more rotund in areas where my peers were childlike. Got down to model-like weight when I was 16. Then it was time to apply for colleges, closed myself in my room for days on end, gained weight, went to live off on my own without any roommates, said goodbye forever to healthy eating and exercising habits, watched a LOT of tv shows, got roommates, went to live even further away from home, on my own but surrounded by friends, got slimmer. Came back to my hometown, away from my friends, got depressed, lost family members, got even more depressed, started overworking. Overeating.

""I'll stop once I'm down working there!"", I used to say. Well that didn't happen now, did it, cause the stress is now work+university. I chose this.

My main problem is, when I focus too much on my ""list of things I must do to secure a life for myself and my parents"", I get away from my social life and that sets my mentality into this loop of ""I'm not good enough"" and what does that even mean? Good enough for myself since I set the standard.

We're all overweight in my family. The only one who's been saved is my puppy.

My problem is I've made myself addicted to sugar. I adore chocolate above all else, and I cannot stop myself from having it if I know it's in the house in one form or another, be it a bar or cookies or hot cocoa.

So now my excuse for reaching age 27 without having taken proper steps toward my actual goal is because I'm 30kg overweight.

Because I'm 30kgs overweight I don't have a relationship.

Because I'm 30kgs overweight I don't post pictures of myself on social media.

Because I'm 30kgs overweight I don't feel like I deserve the happiness I'm aiming at.

Reaching my goal I fear won't be the solution to it all, but it sure will provide levity to my situation. So why am I unable to say no when a big plate of carbonara is put in front of me?

Why did I feel like having 8 nuts and hot cocoa after JUST having had lunch?

Why was I unable to stop myself?

It will take months, but I know that I don't want to look at my birthday pictures with repugnance next year. So I decided that these little updates will be my way to hold myself accountable.

I easily dropped 40 pounds on this amount of calories but now i’ve been plateaued. Should I decrease my calories? I tried to eat around 1200-1300 once but I constantly felt hungry and it just didn’t work for me. Any advice on how to end the plateau?"
0,"Hello all. 

I have recently decided to take my health seriously for the first time in a long time. I started at 310 lbs and have now lost almost 20 lbs, I’m 6 foot 3, male and 24 years old. There are a couple healthy changes I have made to my diet including limiting meat and animal products which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while for environmental reasons. Watching what I eat and counting calories has shown me just how bad I was eating before so I focus now on making meals that are high in fibre and greens. I get my protein from meat substitutes and high protein legumes. 

When I started this journey I began by accepting that I had an unhealthy relationship with food. I was a “food addict” if you will. I have been able to limit my intake of unhealthy food and treat it as a recovering addiction for me and thus far I’ve been successful. I’ve not developed a hard limit on calories, most days I try to stick to roughly 1500 a day, sometimes I eat more than that up to 1,800 and I try not to have less than 1,500. I feel satisfied with the food and haven’t noticed any major changes in how I feel. 

My concern is according to the scale I’m dropping about 1-2 lbs a day doing this. My scale measures body fat and tells me I’m dropping mostly fat, less than a pound of muscle which could be a measurement error and  my body fat percentage has decreased by 3.7%. I feel like I’m eating better in terms of nutrients but dropping 1-2 lbs a day has got me concerned. 

Am I being safe? Should I do something else?

Thanks.

0,"So I started dieting and exercising on 12/1, which is consisting of eating 1500 healthy calories per day, 150 grams of protein, and burning about 2500 according to my smart watch. I run 3 miles 4 days per week and play sports twice per week (run football routes, play basketball). It seems like the numbers added up perfectly as I went down from 218.5 to 188.7 (5'10"" male) as of this morning in a 15 week span. Not gonna lie, I'm pretty damn proud of myself, but I still want to get down between 180-185 then start to bulk.

Now my concern here is, I lost a good amount of muscle mass. Based on the mirror test I can definitely tell I lossed a lot of fat as well because I'm less jiggly, have a tighter stomach than before, smaller love handles (still there unfortunately), and my body fat % went down. I wouldn't say that I'm a smaller version of my 218 self because I can see a lot of fat loss too, but I can definitely tell there was some muscle loss that happened.

To try and prevent this I'm eating 150-170 grams of protein and doing resistance training 3 days per week, but it seemed to not impact retaining my muscle very much.

I have a 3 questions,

-At this point I'm just going to continue doing what I'm doing to get down the last 3-8lbs since it's a little too late to change anything, but what else could I have done to retain muscle? Is it just inevitable that people will lose muscle on a heavy  calorie deficit? I read all over online that lifting and eating a heavy protein diet will slow down muscle loss but like I said before, it didn't really prevent it.

-Also, when I'm done losing my pounds and getting to my goal weight, what should I do to start gaining muscle back without also gaining fat back? Should I just increase my calorie intake to a 500 surplus daily of the healthy foods I'm eating and increase the protein intake to about 200g per day?

-Does losing a pound of muscle and a pound of fat mean that I actually lossed more fat than muscle? I ask this since muscle weighs more than fat on a mass scale. 

I'd appreciate any advice I can get. Once again, I'm super proud of what I was able to do the last 3 or so months, but the muscle loss kind of disappointed me",Lost 30lbs in 15 weeks!...

I haven’t been able to weigh myself in two weeks either. My diet hasn’t been the healthiest since I’ve been so busy (fast food, quick frozen meals, doordash) but I’m still staying under 1500 for the most part.

Stats: 32F / currently 200lbs (90.7 kg)/ height 4ft 9in ( or  145 cm) / very sedentary  job

About 7 - 8 years ago,  I started  my weight loss journey  following loseit and 90daysgoal subreddits  as guides to help me manage. I did really well over that year or two and was only about 10 lbs (was at 133 lbs or 60.3 kg)  from my absolute  goal, and felt amazing minus the fact my heart rate while hiking could be very high.  I met my current  boyfriend and switched companies to further my career; which included a lot of travel. For a period  of time.

Fast forward  a bit to we moved and since then I noticed my drive, my eating habits, and my movement  deteriorated  to point i am officially at my highest weight, and I mentally feel drained. I am  trying  to see someone for my mental health as I think I finally burned  out. (I have  a lot I deal with in my home band work life, and both sides basically tell me to fix the other side,  so I can focus properly.) Personally  I just want like 6 months off on a beach doing nothing,  but that is not realistic, so I'm trying to self help myself, on top of trying  not to worry about my partner  as he struggles  with online learning  as someone  who deals with anxiety, and depression who's counseling support team disappeared nearby the beginning  of COVID, so I'm his sounding board again. 

On top of that I work an office  job that has high workloads and expectations  this time of year, and I feel very underpaid for. These affect my mental health, which in turn affects my drive and increases my junk food cravings  and refusal to really try to make food (so I lean on my classics, bread, minute rice, and frozen items like chicken nuggets, or stuffed  chicken breasts. I don't want to make my simple salads. Or track anything,  even though I know it'll help in the long run. I'm fighting myself  here, and am trying with just simply trying to get back to tracking alone.

The worst of all of it though and the spot I really want help  in right now is my body feels so stiff. I can barely do chores without my lower back killing me. A 15 min walk is even hard on my lower back. I think I need to stretch my hips, and top of thigh (not sure the name of the top of thigh muscle as I think sitting shortens that one). I tried to look up stretches  but most are not  ones I can even get into the position  of at this time.  My belly is too big so I don't get a good range or form. 

What are some stretches you recommend  someone to try?




TL;DR - Reached the most weight I ever had. I know I have  to fight myself on many items like my food choices and intake. But I really want to get back to walking, but need help with stretches to ease lower back/hip pain. Body stiff from long hours sitting and inactivity.  Belly weight makes found stretches hard to do in a good form.

With regard to food, one of my friends introduced me to Keto; and I just wondered if any of you have used it and what results regarding health and weight loss have you encountered.

I've tried searching for guides; and using reddit confuses me slightly 😅
So if anyone could point me in the right direction for understanding this way of eating, recipes and general material - it would be greatly appreciated.

The most I can generally gleam is its low-carb, high fat and promotes Ketosis? I think that's right anyway.

Hi, from the title you can see I’m 18,5’9 and 90kg. Over lockdown I put a stone and a half on and it’s primarily fat. Over the last 3 weeks I’ve been eating 1,500 calories a day (to maintain it was something around 2400) , I used my fitness pal and this told me I would burn 0.8 kg a week using this.

I mainly eat protein and carbs for dinner/lunch. fruit and veg for breakfast, I also have 1 cheat day a week but I only eat up to my calories which will maintain my weight on the cheat day.

I have also been exercising 4 times a week, usually a 30 min bike ride, mostly up hill.

It’s been 3 weeks and my weight has been fluctuating between 90-91kg, I have lost no weight at all and I see no change in my weight.

Am I expecting too much too soon? Is the cheat day ruining my progress? I’m sorry for the long post I just feel like I’m doing something wrong.

0,"Hey everyone. I am a 23 year old male, 6'3"" and currently 209 pounds. I have some pretty strong insecurity about my body and so I am trying to lose enough weight to begin seeing my abs instead of my stomach fat. To this end, I am doing the following

A: Following a five day gym program that aims at progressively getting stronger each week at the four main lifts (Bench, Overhead, Deadlift, Squat) while doing some accessory work. I'd say each day takes me 40-90 mins to complete. 

B: Trying to improve my diet. I have anosmia (meaning I can't smell) and a pleasant side effect is that my tastes are really different. I have never enjoyed sugary foods or drinks and so I haven't had to cut them out of my diet since they never existed! However, I have an issue with binge eating/eating in excess for meals, like ordering a burger with an extra pattie or always getting the large option for sides. This behaviour happens with both takeout food and home food, probably spawning from people telling me i need to eat more because I'm tall when i was a teenager.  To counter this, I am trying to eat only food i cook at home that is relatively healthy and satiating. 

C: I am counting my calories and currently am trying to eat at a weekly average of 1500 calories a day. I say weekly average because I occasionally have big blowout meals followed by a day of much less food to compensate. I know this is low-ish for a person of my height, but I am sick of underestimating how much i am eating and not seeing progress from a more relaxed goal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that I might try and fast for a few days a week to accelerate the initial process. Right now, the mental anguish from being skinnyfat just barely outweighs the gnawing hunger I get after not eating for 6-10 hours, but i can't imagine having this sensation of hunger for a period of days or weeks!

Hey everyone. I am a 23 year old male, 6'3"" and currently 209 pounds. I have some pretty strong insecurity about my body and so I am trying to lose enough weight to begin seeing my abs instead of my stomach fat. To this end, I am doing the following

A: Following a five day gym program that aims at progressively getting stronger each week at the four main lifts (Bench, Overhead, Deadlift, Squat) while doing some accessory work. I'd say each day takes me 40-90 mins to complete. 

B: Trying to improve my diet. I have anosmia (meaning I can't smell) and a pleasant side effect is that my tastes are really different. I have never enjoyed sugary foods or drinks and so I haven't had to cut them out of my diet since they never existed! However, I have an issue with binge eating/eating in excess for meals, like ordering a burger with an extra pattie or always getting the large option for sides. This behaviour happens with both takeout food and home food, probably spawning from people telling me i need to eat more because I'm tall when i was a teenager.  To counter this, I am trying to eat only food i cook at home that is relatively healthy and satiating. 

C: I am counting my calories and currently am trying to eat at a weekly average of 1500 calories a day. I say weekly average because I occasionally have big blowout meals followed by a day of much less food to compensate. I know this is low-ish for a person of my height, but I am sick of underestimating how much i am eating and not seeing progress from a more relaxed goal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that I might try and fast for a few days a week to accelerate the initial process.

0,"Gaining Weight after Weight Lifting

Hi everyone! I have been doing a mix of HIIT, dance, hill walking, and hiking as my exercise for the past two months but recently (like Monday) I started doing at home weight lifting workouts too. I haven’t lost any weight since then (even though I do 40 min of HIIT, 30 min of hill walking, and 30 min of Pilates/strength) and I’m not sure what’s going on. Please tell me what I can do! I have been eating around 1200-1400 everyday (I do OMAD). I also drink around 110 oz of water a day. 

I lost weight (around 15 pounds) pretty fast in the beginning but now I’m stalled at around 190. I don’t want to cut out strength because it’s necessary but it is so frustrating to not see the scale move, especially when I know just cardio will make it move.",Frustrated!,"Frustrated!

0,"I figured you all would get what I'm talking about.

I lost 30 lbs (yay!) last year. Super excited, I busted my butt to learn how to eat healthier without going on a diet, exercise 6x a week and run 5Ks for fun, and I'm working on the daily to better my mentality as I'm on a journey to lose another 20-30lbs this year. (For stats: I am F/5'4"" currently at 168lbs and looking to get down to a health BMI around 140 or below.)

Until I went shopping this weekend for the spring and still had to pick up size 12 shorts and an XL hawaiian shirt. Bum-mer.

After going from 200 to 168 and baggier clothing, I thought I'd be at *least one* size down. Nope. Still the same size in clothing. And for some reason, it felt like I could just say 'fuck it' and go back to my old binge-eating all week / no working out ways. What was the point? I wasn't a single-digit size like I'd hope I would be. Nothing changed.

Then I took a hard look at myself and did my workout / planned the week ahead for meals / decided to make a reminder in my phone to up my protein intake and look up pre-workout mixes to help with my spring training for a faster 5K.

Because I had to remember that toxic mentality of comparing absolutely ridiculous American sizes for clothing did not equal my worth in my achievements. It doesn't negate the fact that I can do HIIT for an hour and my core strength has greatly improved. It certainly doesn't mean the past year of working on myself mentally and physically didn't matter. It also doesn't mean I won't eventually see my belly 'disappear' -- it took years to form, so it will take years to leave.

So today I'm back on my calorie deficit (it was my birthday last week so I gave up some food slack to enjoy it), I start Week 5 of the Heather Robertson workout program, &amp; I'm considering going for a quick mile run after work to celebrate the new weather.

0,"Hi! I want to hold myself accountable in my weight loss/ fitness/ health journey so I’m posting my story here (hope that’s allowed!) :)

So I am a 25 year old woman. I am 5 ft 2. I was always a kind of chubby kid, and it really set in during puberty. I went through a phase of hating my body, then came to love and accept it in my late teens. My weight has always fluctuated but usually sat around 170lbs. In the first few years of university I gained a few pounds, but when I was 21/22, I got really into the gym and healthy eating and lost the weight, back down to 170lbs. 

I know 170lbs is still overweight for my height. My waist was 36 inches and around my tummy (across my bellybutton) was about 40 inches. I had a bit of a tum but I didn’t mind it. I was confident and happy in myself at that weight, was eating healthy and felt good. 

Then the lockdown happened. Here in Ireland, we have been in full lockdown pretty much for an entire year, with a tiny break last summer. And it has destroyed me. We’re not allowed further than five kilometres from our homes, and all gyms are closed. I lost the will to exercise because I was depressed and anxious, I started eating really really poorly, my posture got so much worse from being slumped in the couch all day (which only made me look even fatter). I didn’t realise how much weight I had gained until I tried to fit into a dress at Christmas time that had fit me only the week before lockdown began in March 2020. It wouldn’t even close over. 

I’ve gone from wearing a UK 16 (or occasionally even a 14) or L to a UK 18, maybe even a 20, and XL. I had to buy all new underwear because my bras don’t fit any more. I’ve hit 200lbs and my waist now measures at 40 inches. Around my bellybutton is now 44 and a half inches. I have a double chin and a huge belly and bat wings on my arms and my thighs have gone super dimply. I just want my old self back. 

I don’t want to lose loads of weight. I don’t want to be “thin”. I just want to feel like myself again, fit into my clothes again, and feel confident and strong in my body. 

So I’m giving myself until July 1st. There’s nothing like a deadline to motivate me, and I’ll be out of work until then according to Ireland’s current lockdown trajectory. So I’m going to use my time wisely. 

I will try to drink three litres of water a day, but at least 2. 

I will go for a run or a cycle every single morning. One or the other. 

I will practice yoga every day. This will improve my posture, will help me features to help with weight loss, and will help me burn calories. 

I will walk everywhere that I can. I will go for walks at lunch time. 

I will eat as healthy as I can. I will take my probiotics and my vitamin supplements daily. 

I won’t be strictly tracking calories but I will be keeping an eye on them so as to not ever overeat by a huge amount. 

I will only weigh myself at the very end of the challenge.

0,"If you're anything like me (and one thing I have learned here is that there are lots of people like me) then you are less disciplined at the weekend than during the week.  I've been super-careful during the week and letting things slide at the weekends.

What I have realised is that this is skewing my numbers and putting me into a gain-loss pattern.

The most obvious thing is that I gain weight at the weekends.  I over eat, I eat too much salt and I gain sometimes as much as 5 or 6lbs in a couple of days.  

The next, less obvious, thing is when I get back on track, that weight drops off *fairly* easily.  Not super easily, but with fresh food, lower salt and plenty of water it's gone by Wednesday/Thursday.

The problem is, in my mind, I am therefore trucking along on Thursday, back to good losses and can ease up a little at the weekend...then, guess what?

The past 3 weeks or so I have ""plateaued"" only it hasn't been a plateau at all, it has been the gain-loss cycle described above.

This weekend I tried damage limitation - only one indulgent meal, very little snacking, plenty of exercise and hydration.  And I came through the weekend with no gain.  Now, I am back into weekdays with my set routines, training plan, pre-prepared meals etc and I should be able to parlay the weekend into a proper loss by Friday.  

TL:DR.  Losing the plot at weekends can put you in a gain-loss pattern.  Changing that to a maintain-loss pattern can transform your results.

Hope this helps someone.",Why Damage Limitation at the weekend could be a game changer...,"Why Damage Limitation at the weekend could be a game changer...

What I have realised is that this is skewing my numbers and putting me into a gain-loss pattern.

The most obvious thing is that I gain weight at the weekends.  I over eat, I eat too much salt and I gain sometimes as much as 5 or 6lbs in a couple of days.  

The next, less obvious, thing is when I get back on track, that weight drops off *fairly* easily.  Not super easily, but with fresh food, lower salt and plenty of water it's gone by Wednesday/Thursday.

The problem is, in my mind, I am therefore trucking along on Thursday, back to good losses and can ease up a little at the weekend...then, guess what?

The past 3 weeks or so I have ""plateaued"" only it hasn't been a plateau at all, it has been the gain-loss cycle described above.

This weekend I tried damage limitation - only one indulgent meal, very little snacking, plenty of exercise and hydration.  And I came through the weekend with no gain.  Now, I am back into weekdays with my set routines, training plan, pre-prepared meals etc and I should be able to parlay the weekend into a proper loss by Friday.  

TL:DR.  Losing the plot at weekends can put you in a gain-loss pattern.  Changing that to a maintain-loss pattern can transform your results.

Hope this helps someone."
0,"Hello everyone,

I am writing this post to thank the people that achieved what I've started and also to document my progress. I will update this post weekly mainly as a way to hold myself accountable.

So here's my journey and plan:
- I am currently 29 with a 6'0 height and 240 lbs. I've had excess weight as long as I knew myself and wanted to lose it before starting my 30s. I am planning to reach 200 lbs by the mid-summer and 180 lbs by fall.

- I will be limiting my calorie intake at 1500. As I am working from home, it is easier to cut calories as most of the time I am at BMR levels of activity. Also I've observed my food consumption and other than occasional fast food and snacks I am eating at a 2000-2200 level so cutting would not be drastic.

- Cardio - walk 6 days a week with at least 30-min per day with 3.5 mph speed. This is to lower my cholesterol, insulin resistance and boost endorphins.

- Weight training for 3 days per week. This is to improve my calorie deficit and also gain some muscular mass while lowering fat mass.

- No meals after 7PM, only water.

Overall, I've calculated to be at a 1000 calories deficit per day which should help me achieve my goals. One issue that is bugging me is my current meal plan macros are 25% fat, 40% carb with 1/7 of them fibers and 35% protein. Should I lower my carb gradually and increase my protein or would this be enough?


Also, would this weight change create saggy skin and how can I mitigate it?


Please feel free to provide comments/feedback on my plan,

I decided on Feb 2nd that something needed to change and I wanted to lose weight. I stopped drinking soda and stopped eating fast food.

What has been killing my motivation, since march 1st im hovering around 178-179 (let me see 177 once!!!) so I decided to add whey protein and a multivitamin, which I added on march 5th.

Going to add on, I am not really counting calories I changed the way i eat (prob not the smartest) but i went from drinking 32-60 oz of soda a day and eating fast food sometimes twice a day. and currently im eating the following (not counting calories)

breakfast - oatmeal / shake

I’m currently going through quite severe depression in addition to a difficult to treat chronic health disorder which causes me lots of pain and discomfort and I have approximately zero energy to exert on anything beyond getting out of bed and using the toilet. Anything beyond that drains my energy faster than google maps drains my phone. I don’t have the energy to even maintain proper hygiene and can only shower every few day. Due to this, I particularly struggle with food prep and cooking.

Washing up in particular causes me a lot of pain. I am not exaggerating when I say that I am looking for recipes with zero prep and cooking that are vaguely healthy, not excessively high in calories and can sustain me if eaten only once a day.

It is the only thing I look forward to, but I can eat other things if I didn’t have to prepare them.

I'm hoping this sub can give me some input as to what I may want to change or eliminate first. I eat most of the sugar before 4pm, and the types of sugars vary. Really appreciate any advice.

Morning gym shake: 1.5c milk -26g, banana 14g, 1 scoop protein powder 0g, 0.5c oats 1g, 1tbsp peanut butter 2g

Kombucha (a treat I guess, but I like the gut biome qualities) 16g

Fage greek yogurt with honey (I eat half the honey) 20ish g

A Bays english muffin with 2 eggs, smoked salmon, dill, red onion and a small smear of cream cheese - 2g in the Bays but refined carb

Usually a Larabar as a snack during the day -17g

Lunch usually something like a shredded chicken breast or tuna sandwich on whole wheat bread, tortikla, or mixed with brown rice ramen noodle serving, veggies, little mayo etc

At night my wife cooks and there's usually some type of ""healthy"" carb like lentil or chick pea pastas, almond flour turkey meatballs, 90/10 beef dishes, lean meats, healthy soups, veggies etc.

I almost never eats sweets like sugar, candy, etc on weeknights.

2-3 measured alcoholic drinks 4x a week. Cocktails on weekdays are dry (martini etc), do have craft ipas sometimes, and wine

6'3 195lbs normally, but right now ive been 205ish, but this is after I added the milk based gym shake in the mornings about 4 months ago.

Gym 5-6x a week, rigorous, capable of lifting heavy weight 250-300lb bench if maxing

Run 2.5 miles 4-5x week or swim 30min 4-5x week, one of the two

I cook and have cheat meals on weekend nights like Italian, pasta etc.

It’s been a long journey to get where I am currently (about two years) and a lot of mistakes such as starving myself to try and achieve my goals. I’ve recently started clean eating and weight lifting rather than focusing on extreme amounts of cardio and mass amounts of under eating and then binging over the weekend. 

I’ve always had a bit of an issue around calories. My fitness pal recommends that if I was sedentary and did nothing all day I would need about 1200 calories to sustain myself. 

I weight lift and do high intensity training at least 4-5 times a week and on average walk about 2 miles a day if not four sometimes. I’m also a secondary school teacher and have to move around my school to teach.

I currently max out about 1400 calories a day - is this enough or do I need to eat more? I also track my macros and try to make sure they are balanced as possible.

0,"Hi, been a lurker here for a bit. Info: 25F, 5’5”, currently ~173-175 lbs depending on the day.

recently wondering if there’s a chance I have some condition that makes losing weight a real slog. Lots of details: 

• 2018: ~140lbs. 


• Across 2018, 2019: gained ~10-15. fed at my tech job for breakfast/lunch every day. did tend to make healthy choices there. 

• 2019: started Orange Theory 3-6 times a week religiously. I work a very sedentary job (software).  most athletic I’d been since high school cross country. on gym leaderboards etc. 150-155lbs. 

• Covid: Gained ~5lbs (no more OTF). eating quite healthy, 1400-1500 calories per day since I moved back home and could track EVERYTHING. I have a new scale, I weigh even my flax seeds and cooking oil etc. ~160 lbs through Halloween.

• Holidays 2020: fell off the rails but not any worse than previous years. gained 10-15. At 175lbs. Day after Christmas: wtf! revert to strictly 1400 calorie days. My 60 year old mom eats the same as me (I’m living with her atm). She’s sedentary. Like 1-2k steps a day. I start to walk 10-12k+ steps every single day, religiously (got Apple Watch at new year). some light lifting and/or 30 minute YouTube video twice a week (in addition to the walks). Religiously hit my daily watch goal of 45 min of exercise. 

Issue: weight is coming off at a glacial pace. At like 0.25-0.5 pounds a week if lucky. Lose It says I should be losing 2 a week! 

mom’s weight melted off, 15+  pounds in the same time frame with no exercise. I don’t eat back calories after exercise. 

I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been despite being way healthier than my 2018 self. so frustrated. hoped to be 170 at least, after two months.  

Like I said, I weigh EVERYTHING. Almost obsessively. 

Is there a chance I have some condition? Like I don’t burn as many calories as someone else just doing nothing? not familiar with conditions that might hinder weight loss. 

Currently have a heart rate of 50 when I sleep and rest, is that indicative of anything? At Orange Theory, I struggled to get my splat points (earned per minute of elevated heart rate over a threshold) even when running faster and lifting heavier than relatively fit people around me. 

made an appointment a month out with GP for blood panels, but this might keep me motivated until then... 

Maybe I need to lower to 1200 daily, but that seems so low given my current activity and previous eating habits a few years ago.

0,"A vacuum sealer. More specifically, vacuum sealing grilled and sliced chicken breast. [Here’s what 33 lbs of raw chicken breast comes out to](https://imgur.com/a/QutvI80). I started at 250 lbs on July 5 (6’/male). 6 days a week, my main meal is a salad with 6oz of chicken breast on it. Sunday I eat whatever mom cooks when I visit them for “family dinner”. Each of those bags is 18oz of grilled breast, so a standard week would see me going through 2 bags. On the day I’m finishing off a bag, I stick a new one in the fridge and it defrosts by the next evening.

I normally don’t get so much chicken, but I found a deal for 99c a pound at a local grocery store so I ended up getting 33 pounds worth. It’s probably a little excessive, but I know that I’m going to end up eating at all, so it only made sense to prepare in advance. I highly recommend a vacuum sealer if you don’t already have one… And of course, a food scale. [Here are some of the salads I’ve made](https://imgur.com/a/Rc5WFTu). I’ve found that the best thing to do is keep them interesting, so you don’t get bored eating the same basic thing every day.

To that extent, I’ve found myself using a lot of add-in’s. Walmart makes a “great value” brand topper called “maple glazed pecan pieces with dried dates and apples” ($1.89/4oz bag). Salad Pizzaz makes a number of great ones, like “raspberry cranberry green walnut frisco” (2.89/4oz bag). Nature’s Garden makes “savory salad topper with almonds, walnuts, pepitas, sunflower seeds, and chia cheese sticks”. I also recommend craisens… If you’re feeling adventurous, you can look for orange or strawberry flavored Craisins at Trader Joe’s. Other add-ins are Napa cabbage (I usually add this to each salad since it’s so low-cal), artichoke hearts, apples, berries, etc.

I used to tried a lot of different dressings, but I’ve pretty much exclusively limited myself to Newman’s Own lately. Their Ginger Sesame dressing tastes great, and is only 35 cals per 2 tablespoons. Their light balsamic is only 45c/2T. Also, I like “Bitten” brand’s creamy lime avocado dressing (45c/2T). The only word of advice I can give is to be very cautious when using dressings, because it’s easy to use regular regular dressing and completely defeat the purpose of eating a salad in the first place, since most normal dressings have around 150 cals per 2 tablespoons.

Anyway, I just wanted to share what I do that has been effective for me. I am 3 pounds away from hitting my target goal of 165, which will be the first time that I have weighed that little since high school. I’m in my mid/late-30’s now. I went from a size 42 waist to a 32. I’ve had to buy new clothes, new belts, and yes, new boxer briefs. That being said, it’s a very good problem to have. Once I hit my target weight I’m going to start exercising more and eating more food. 

I’ve limited myself to 1500 cals per day, every day. I’m going to bump that to 2000 a day once I hit 165 to see if that, combined with exercise, gives me enough energy to lift weights while maintaining a weight of between 170-180. I wanted to get to 165 so I could adjust my eating habits and find what number works for me, which I assume will result in a little weight gain while I get used to it (that’s where the 165 to 170 comes into play). 

 Anyway, if anybody has any questions, just let me know. I hope this has been of some help to someone. I never thought I could drop the weight I did - but I did.

2. We moved to a different state
3. I moved my father from his home to permanent assisted-living
4. I had to represent my sister in a civil court matter as her power of attorney
5. I went back to graduate school (already planned and paid for prior)
6. I had a major health scare that thankfully was only temporary and has been resolved

I started my diet back in January where I was 194 lbs and I’ve been fluctuating around 182 lbs for three weeks straight. I have been accurately tracking my calories (using a scale to the nearest gram) and logging everything into MyFitnessPal. I am confident that I have been eating at least at a deficit of 4000 cal per week ( and that’s rounding up all the calories to the nearest 100, the actual deficit is higher). Yet, my weight hasn’t changed at all. Sometimes when I weight myself first thing in the morning, after going to the toilet, I find that my weight is higher by three to five pounds. 

As for my training, I’ve  been lifting for five to six days a week for the past five weeks, and I can see changes in the pictures I have been taking. I spend 45 minutes on the elliptical six days a week, and I know I am going hard because by the end of it I am covered in sweat and don’t have the energy to do much (which walking doesn’t do for me). 

Theoretically, I should have lost at least three pounds of fat, but the numbers aren’t moving down, and it’s discouraging when I see that the number goes up on some days. Should I consider going on a larger deficit and up my cardio? Or should I wait it out for a couple of weeks before making any changes?

Here's my body. So i used to be a sedentary skinnyfat person many years ago before i started gymming, i still am skinnyfat but with some muscles. I never ate enough so i never really gained much muscles or increased lifts. Stuck in mediocrity. Always stuck at 20%. How do i get out of 20% BF?

My lifts are bench, 80kg 5 reps. OHP 50kg 5 reps. Row 67kg with knuckles forwards 5 reps. 8 good proper pullups. Deadlift is 120kg but i'm out of weights to put on it now. Squat is too embarrassing to tell. Biceps curls 10kg for 8 reps.

If i have calculated my diet right i get 2000 calories and 200 protein per day. My height is 184cm, weight is 90kg. I have gymmed for about 3 years, i don't skip gym days besides when i am sick which is like once a year.



My routine is: monday: 5x5 bench press/OHP (alternating), 5x5 row, 5x5 squat/deadlift (alternating), 3x8 clapping pushups, 3x8 biceps curl and on OHP days it is 3x8 lat raises
wednesday: 5x5 bench press/OHP (alternating), 5x5 row, 5x5 squat/deadlift (alternating), 3x8 clapping pushups, 3x8 biceps curl and on OHP days it is 3x8 lat raises

Hey guys. I’ve been losing weight for a good 4 ish months now and I’ve become familiar with how my body reacts when I eat a certain way or how long I hold water weight. Typically, I eat more around maintenance on Saturdays and I still lose a pound a week consistently. I usually gain like 1-2 pounds water weight after that said Saturday which I’m used to and it goes away after 2-3 days. However, I did my typical maintenance day Saturday and put on a bit of water weight, but that was gone by Monday and I was at my current weight. It’s now Tuesday and I stepped on the scale and I’ve gone up two pounds which is really weird for me and how my weight fluctuates. I’m not panicing too much because it’s probably just water, but I’ve been eating in deficit perfectly since Sunday so I’m confused why it’s jumped up all of a sudden.

this post is kind of a rant, and also me looking for advice.

i’m F 5’2’’, and i’ve been doing CICO for a few months. my SW was 148 and i’m currently at 129. this is great progress, but i’ve been hovering at 128ish for the past 3 weeks! i’m on a 1200 calorie diet and i’ve gotten back into running, usually running 4-5 miles 4-5x a week. i know my calorie input is low by usual standards, but i don’t feel hungry and if i do, i don’t hesitate to eat a healthy snack. 

why does weight loss stop suddenly? i know i’m short and weight loss is already hard, but my running endurance is improving and its getting easier, i’m on a low cal diet and still the scale doesn’t budge. i’m not super focused on numbers, but i’d still like to see a general trend. do i increase exercise? i’m not sure what my next steps should be. thanks all and happy losing!","weight plateau, ugh","weight plateau, ugh hi all! first off, this sub is amazing!!

0,"Hey all, I’m here to check in! It’s been a crazy few months.


I’ve got good news: I haven’t binged since my last check in! I have spent the last month going into a deficit and have lost almost ten pounds.



Now the bad news: I’m pushing hard, because I had blood work done and my a1c hit 5.7. I am officially prediabetic. I’ve spent the last month busting my butt to get this weight down. I refuse to become a diabetic. I refuse. I don’t want my daughter to grow up with her mama being type two. Hence the sudden weight loss. 


I am currently sitting at 212.4 as of yesterday morning.  I am trying to lose two pounds a week until I hit 200, then I’ll be happy with 1-1.5. 


I’m tired all the time and very weak. With my doctors monitoring me, I’m eating between 1400-1500kcal a day. I am just under 5’3 and female. It’s hard, but i have to do this. I miss feeling sexy.

0,"Last summer I did it. I hit the 100lbs lost mark. I made it from 283, to 183 which also put me - just barely - in a normal BMI. It took a year and a half.

Since then I've been struggling to lose the last 10-15 lbs I'd like to lose. My weight has been pretty steady around the 180-183 range, once dropping down to 177 but I always put those few pounds back on. Watching the scale go down that first year and a half was like a drug. It was what kept me going. Now that it's barely moving I've had a more difficult time. It's not just that. This past year has done a whammy on the positive and healthy habits I gained. Couldn't go to the gym, so I bought dumbbells and a yoga mat and started working out at home. That went great for a few months and then I got in a bad car accident. The concussion took 2-3 months to heal.

Worked on getting back to my exercise routine and then I started to have back pain (It ended up being a UTI that cleared up with antibiotics). 

Got back on track again, and then I got covid. Really really easing back into things after that. I had it a month ago and am pretty much  back to normal but I've read articles about people going too hard after recovering and then relapsing. I don't want to risk that.

But it's not just having the exercise. I am 'treating' myself way more often than I did in that year and a half. I know if I could just cut that out things would be better. I just ate 1000cals worth of jelly beans in one sitting. After Christmas, I brought a bunch of discounted chocolate. I always have the best intentions. I'll buy this thing and expose myself to this food trigger and I'll get better at my control.

It never quite works out that way.

I know I need to have self compassion for myself and not let things like this send me into a spiral, but it scares me. I was so fat. I know the statistics, most people gain it all back and more. I don't want to go back, but I don't know how to get out of this rut.

I went to the store yesterday to exchange a shirt and a pair of khakis. The khakis *technically* fit fine, but they weren't as roomy as I liked them, and I already had a shirt in that color.

A year ago, buying clothes was a **nightmare**. It was super stressful, and I ended up basically having a ""uniform"" - jeans, a tee-shirt, and maybe a flannel or hoodie. It was super hard to find clothes too - I often went store to store, picking up whatever stock they may have in my size. I also didn't feel super confident in what I wore, and my chances of getting properly gendered was probably a 50/50 shot.

As I've lost weight, I've started incorporating... fancier clothes? Not really fancy, but I'm wearing more button-ups and I've started buying actual pants. I've also been incorporating clothes that would normally make me dysphoric, like button-ups with tiny floral detail or more tailored pants.

And holy cow! I feel ***way*** more confident! Not just in how I look, but overall. I feel more confident speaking up in classes, walking to the coffee shop, going grocery shopping... I also get misgendered less! Nowadays I'm probably gendered correctly 80-90% of the time.

I will also say it's way easier finding clothes. When I went to the store yesterday I was actually kind of overwhelmed with choices for shirts! Pants are still somewhat tricky because of my height, but it wasn't like I only had a couple of options. I ended up also impulse-buying a sweater. It's not a sweater I'd normally wear, but I absolutely *love* how it looks on me.

In the summer of 2019, I struggled a lot with my self confidence and I felt that I was too fat, even though I had a BMI around 18-18,5. I didn’t eat a lot through out the day(it wasn’t really bad, maybe around 700-1000kcal, but still too little) at some point I kinda forgot about it, If that makes sense, I didn’t really think about my weight too much anymore.  

Now, since July maybe, I’ve started to get those thoughts again. I think it’s also because my two friends both also eat very little, one of them talks to me about it a lot and the other is even diagnosed with anorexia. 
It’s definitely not that I want that, but I think it has triggered something. (They both don’t know that I struggle with these insecurities)

Since then I started counting calories again. (I didn’t count calories in the time between summer 2019 and summer 2020, so I don’t know what I ate in those days). 

Some days I eat 700 kcal and some days I eat 1800.. I know that’s not good, and I really want to fix it.

My boyfriend started off really supportive of me trying to lose weight and eat healthier. It's been almost exactly a month since I started. Last night he told me something along the lines of ""I think it's really great that you're eating healthier and exercising and tracking your calories, but it's really starting to drive me crazy."" This is because he does most of the cooking but I have to scan the barcodes on everything and I'm like ""how much butter did you just use?"" or ""can I assemble my enchiladas? I need to weigh what I'm putting in them."" I don't mean to annoy him, but I need to know everything I'm putting in my body. He also won't measure things even though he knows I need to know how much it is. I don't think this is malicious. I think he just doesn't consider it, but it'll be something like ""hey, how's much cream cheese is in the sauce you made?"" ""Idk, like 2 scoops?"" Like great, I can barely estimate how much that means. 

Also, he makes eating less junk harder. A lot of people in this sub say if you don't want to eat something just don't have it in the house but I'm not going to dictate what my boyfriend can and can't eat. He has stopped getting hostess snowballs at least, which is nice. Thankfully I don't drink soda because there are literally 48 cans of diet coke in our apartment. A bigger problem than what he buys for himself is what he buys for me. The other night he bought me gummy bears for no reason because he knows I love gummy bears. It was really sweet of him but I don't want to eat candy right now.

Did anyone else have similar problems or have advice?

0,"Hey everyone,

For the past couple of weeks my weight has been fluctuating and staying around the same place in a way that I have not seen through my entire journey of losing 60 pounds. 

 I’m including my weight log at the bottom to illustrate this better but I essentially feel as though I am not losing weight and not able to move onto the 220s and just continually moving up and down in the 230s. To give some context about my diet and exercise: I am a 6’2” on a calorie deficit and light exercise. I try to eat 2000 calories a day - sometimes I eat less than this but never more. I watch my sodium intake to reduce water weight (but honestly I love hot sauce so this is difficult sometimes and it may go over slightly 1-2 days of the week) I start out every morning with a walk that burns about 150 calories and I’ve started to jog as well. I very rarely have cheat meals (maybe once a month) 

My nutritionist told me that if I don’t eat my recommended calorie amount my body will retain fat, so I’ve started to try to get as close to that 2000 calorie goal as possible. I have also started jogging to build muscle mass so my body can metabolize better. Despite doing all these things that I did not do to lose my initial 60 pounds, I’m finding it impossible to move past 230.

0,"Hey, 

1 year ago I lost 14 kgs in 5 weeks with minimal activity and by simply eating a lot less and cutting out all junk food, and it paid off. I fit into all of the clothes I owned again and I was completely fine. During quarantine last year, I got lazy and slacked off a lot and I put on the 14 kgs that I lost plus an additional 2 kgs, so in total I gained 16 kgs, which is the most I've ever put on (I'm 22 years old). 

Now I know exactly how my body works, what I can and can't eat, what will ruin my diet and what won't, and so on. And I'm going to be completely honest, in the last 32 days I have not bought any kind of fast food whatsoever, but in those 32 days I can remember eating a bit of junk food 4 times but not enough that I completely ruined all of my progress. I've been going to the gym now 5 days a week, lifting weights consistently for 12 weeks and I've made some significant growth in muscle, but my weight just continues to slowly go up and I have no idea why. I started the gym at 94 kgs and I now weigh 96 kgs. 

I know for a fact that my last 2 - 3 weeks of eating have either matched my eating from 1 year ago when I lost weight or it has actually improved in comparison. I bought calipers 2 months ago and I tested them around 10 times using proper methods and the results ranged from 21 - 24% body fat percentage, with it being more consistent somewhere in the middle.

Thanks",Weight continues to go up but I've been working hard,"Weight continues to go up but I've been working hard Hey, 

1 year ago I lost 14 kgs in 5 weeks with minimal activity and by simply eating a lot less and cutting out all junk food, and it paid off. I fit into all of the clothes I owned again and I was completely fine. During quarantine last year, I got lazy and slacked off a lot and I put on the 14 kgs that I lost plus an additional 2 kgs, so in total I gained 16 kgs, which is the most I've ever put on (I'm 22 years old). 

Now I know exactly how my body works, what I can and can't eat, what will ruin my diet and what won't, and so on. And I'm going to be completely honest, in the last 32 days I have not bought any kind of fast food whatsoever, but in those 32 days I can remember eating a bit of junk food 4 times but not enough that I completely ruined all of my progress. I've been going to the gym now 5 days a week, lifting weights consistently for 12 weeks and I've made some significant growth in muscle, but my weight just continues to slowly go up and I have no idea why. I started the gym at 94 kgs and I now weigh 96 kgs.

0,"Trying to lose weight in the middle of a pandemic, while depressed, planning a wedding, and working a very stressful job is maybe not the best idea. Especially without much of a support system. Especially especially as a woman with a very small frame, so my calorie deficit may need to get fairly intense to hit my goal weight. But I'm so tired of feeling like I can't buy clothes because they all look terrible on me, and hating photos of myself.

Anyway. Week 1 was successful, I'd say! Lost a couple lbs, probably all water weight, but it was nice to see on the scale regardless. It gets harder from here and I'm hoping I can stay motivated for the year or so between now and when I want to hit my goal. I'm trying to be really easy on myself, not counting every single exact calorie and instead just giving myself a solid idea of my overall calorie intake for the day. If I go a little over, fine, no worries. I'll probably be a little under on a different day. I have a year, it'll balance out. If I get too exacting, as I've done in the past, I know I'll just burn out and quit.

It feels stupid and awkward to post about this or talk about but also sucks to feel alone in what I'm doing, so... hi! Wish me luck.

0,"29F, I have always been overweight and am bordering now on obese. I have anxiety and ADHD and a good medication for it now, which helps with impulsive or entertainment eating. The thing is, once I start cutting back foods or even tracking calories, hunger makes me genuinely anxious. Sometimes I shake or feel like crying. I struggle to stick to any calorie goal-- right now I want to stay under 1900 and often I'm hungry after the calories are gone. The more days I spend in a deficit, the more emotional I usually get. 

I'm trying to focus on just tracking calories so it won't feel like such a burden. But I know I need to have a calorie deficit to lose weight. I'm trying to cut back on sugar because I know it must be making my blood sugar up and down-- so tough because carbs at what I crave most!

Does anyone have advice for the emotional drain dieting can bring on? Success stories make it seem like it was just a long-term, boring project and for me the food and lack thereof makes me really emotional. I don't think it's just a matter of willpower or eating cucumbers all day as they haven't worked for me in the dozen attempts in the past. Being hungry feels like the beginning of a panic attack.

0,"Hey all,

So roughly about two week ago I posted this on the IF page and CICO page seeking some help, didnt really get a clear advice, so please read on and advise if you can.

Need some advice, I am trying to lose weight but whatever I am doing isnt working out.

Been in the gym for 5 weeks now, i have been tracking my food and I am getting in roughly 1400-1600 cals a day ( I am 6'4"" and 113kgs) and drinking 2L for water a day ...plus I am going to gym 5 times a week.... 3 days are cardio and 2 days are weight training.

My gym sessions are anywhere between 45-55mins and my bpm is between 135-145 through all my sessions ...I roughly burn between 650-800 cals in these session (all the data from my watch).

I take weekends off to rest and maybe enjoy 1 meal that is something like a burger, pizza, fried chicken, dumplings etc you get the point but its only one meal in the weekend of the type.

Doing 16:8 (16 fasting 8 eating)

But my weight is exactly the same and has not budged .... measurements around my arms, waist and thighs are no different either.

I cant figure out what I am doing wrong.

Adding to this - since posting this I increase the calories and am getting in roughly 2000 cals now ...have not seen an increase in weight yet, but I dont want that anyway.

Edit - have taken measurements and everything is the same around arms, neck, stomach, thighs, hips

Also did get my blood tested as well and everything came back fine with nothing wrong",Need Help as I am not seeing results not sure why...,"Need Help as I am not seeing results not sure why... Hey all,

0,"Hi! I’ve been debating posting here for a while but I’m a 19 year old who is/was morbidly obese (BMI was over 43 now 38) and started the keto (though my version was more of a dirty version) back December 1st. I have been scared of diabetes and heart issues for a while now and realized I needed to make a change so I wouldn’t end up on “My 600lb Life”. I worked away from home for a month and practically lived off of Mountain Dew, Meijer cookies, and Burger King. I was extremely sedentary and realized I really was not getting any healthier.

As I stated previously, I started Keto but tried limiting myself to 35 carbs a day which f*cking sucked. I lost about 20 pounds which was wonderful but shopping for food made me so depressed. Once I plateau’d though, I got back on my bullshit and started eating carbs again. I was between 269-271 on my plateau but I luckily didn’t gain much weight after starting carbs again. I started my journey back up after a month long break and tried something new. I’m down to 257.6 pounds as I am writing this and it’s been approx. 2.5 weeks since I started back up. 

So what have I done?
Well my breakfasts consist of either oatmeal then a nature valley protein bar, or I’ll go more “traditional” with an egg, a slice of whole wheat toast, and a rice cake with strawberry cream cheese on it. I start my day off with easy calories to burn while keeping carbs the highest. Then I stop eating until 6-7 (generally I wake up at 11). I use this time in between to simply walk or just do whatever I need to do at my job (which fortunately requires standing). I will not eat until I reach 10,000 steps... that is unless my blood sugar drops or I feel extremely hungry (not boredom hunger). If I want a snack I’ll eat carrots and hummus or cheese. 

Once dinner rolls around it’s usually grilled chicken or a chipotle bowl (with cauliflower rice). I eat a filling dinner and have been attempting to stop eating by 9:00, 9:35 at the latest.

As I was approaching the one year anniversary of my weight loss journey, I had a realization. For years I’ve been yo-yoing with my weight and every now and then, whenever I would get just a hint of motivation, the first thought that would always come to my mind would be “I’ll start on Monday”. The fact that it was Wednesday when I would said that obviously led me to other five days of eating crap. I mean I was totally justified, I said that I would start on Monday and it wasn’t Monday yet. And I wondered how I couldn’t lose weight, ha.

Now, I can say that I successfully shred 30lbs off my body, despite having a few binging episode and weeks (\**coff*\* months \**coff*\*, hello summer yes I’m referring to you) where I just didn’t feel like counting calories. So of course I slipped and had to get back on track several times. Which for the record I did, sometimes sooner, other later. But guess what?

I didn’t start *once* on Monday.

Don’t wait for a new week, new month or even a new year. I know that it sounds easier, hell I dare to say tempting. To get a clean cut, starting from scratch, like it would erase all those failed attempts. It might even feel like you’re getting a boost of serotonin from the mere thought of starting on a blank page. At least that’s how I felt. But deep down you know that it’s actually harder. Because you feel a lot worst if you screw up on that specific date.

What I learned during this last year, is that you have the power to trick your brain and decide where that blank page opens. You don't have to wait for life or time to start writing your own story, you can pick up the pen and just doodle something. I'd recommend starting with: “Fuck Mondays, we don’t know ‘em”. It's worth it, I promise.","Fuck Mondays, we don't know 'em","Fuck Mondays, we don't know 'em F25, 5'10, SW 171, CW 141, GW leaner and stronger

I wanted to give you guys an update from my last post!
(If there’s a better way to do this other than commenting on that post with updates, please let me know!)

I have seen a mental shift in myself that is subtle but feels permanent. I am essentially correcting myself every time I start to engage in negative self talk. I just put a stop to it and instead choose objectivity, acceptance, being gentle with myself, and finally trying to find something about myself I can feel confident about instead. 

Having body dysmorphia is so strange, because it has this element of gaslighting that makes you question both yourself AND the people who love you. If someone compliments my body and I can’t see what they see, it makes me feel like everyone is lying to me to pacify me, and it creates baseless resentment and anger towards that person. It’s so deep rooted and it’s so hard to rewire your brain if you struggle with it. 
I am a very reasonable, rational person and I’m not quick to anger or resentment or anything like that. But I have to check myself often when people compliment me, because I have been taught by so many that my body is ugly that I have internalized it. 

I’m just so proud of the woman I’m becoming despite those fucked up mental barriers that had the potential to destroy me. I am trying so hard to love myself deeply, intimately and truly.

Today I took this picture. I’m sure I’ve lost a few pounds since my last post (as I’ve been incorporating permanent eating, mental, and physical changes into my life) but that isn’t my concern at this moment.
Instead, I’m proud that I can look at this body, post it on the internet, and say to myself, “you are beautiful and your body is lovable. There are so many things about you that are lovable! “

That’s all! Thanks for reading. :-) 💕 so much love to whoever this finds.

Ive always been a big girl, although i did really slim down and was quite skinny between the ages of 12-15, but then on birth control the weight started creeping up. I had a baby in Nov 2019 which resulted in an emergency c-section and that has messed my stomach area up as you can imagine, because of that and being a first time mum along with covid i just piled on the pounds. I have been feeling so down, lost all of my confidence, and ive been so desperate to lose the weight but i just didnt have the drive and willpower to do it. In January my partner began his weight loss journey, he has been eating clean and goes out running 3/4 times a week and so far has lost a huge 2st 7lb. Im so happy for him and quite envious, its seeing his hard work and enjoyment that has nailed it in my head that I am finally ready to start my journey. 

I have joined Apple Fitness+ and im really enjoying it at the moment, especially the dance workouts, they are so much fun.

And I'm too scared to get plastic surgery to fix my body and now I'm even gaining back weight despite constantly trying new diets which somehow work for other people but just screw me over. 

Where do I go from here.

I always eat a big dinner and have lots of heavy whipping cream in my coffee, so I am not worried about being low on calories. I am just trying to control my appetite and eating, and stopping binging. I know the shakes have sugar, and I am not really wanting to hear opinions on the healthiness of the shakes. lol.

What my question is, is 8 oz of milk and a scoop of the shake mix REALLY supposed to be a meal? 8 oz comes out to a cup of milk, and my shake didn't even fill my glass half way. How is a cup of milk supposed to be a meal? I blended it up in the blender with whole milk and didn't have any ice on hand but have read that some people add ice to make it thicker.

My fiancee and I have been doing HIIT cardio and dieting the past 2 and a half months and seeing good steady weight loss (around 8-10lbs each), but we've gone kind of slow the last couple weeks.  I decided to recalculate our TDEE.

Using a fat caliper to calculate body fat %, we estimated that we were about 19% (me) and 26% (her) respectively.  Wanting to cut down that to a more fit range, we decided to recalculate our TDEE and found that I'm somewhere in the range of 1930 cal for maintenance, while she's at 1671 for maintenance.

We've been doing the TDEE - 20% for the past while and its been great though slowing down.  Recently we found a lot of places saying TDEE - 500 cal.  Which one is it?  Any other tips for consistently losing weight to get to a more lean body fat %?

Nothing crazy is going on with me, it’s a rather typical story: I was fit most of my life, I used food as a coping mechanism in my late teens-early 20s, and it hurt my body while also not helping my feelings.

I’m proud of myself for the progress I’ve made, and wanted to join a group where I could share my accomplishments along with my struggles. You guys get it, and I hope that seeing your successes and struggles will help me feel less like I’m the only one who struggles with their weight.

0,"When I started trying to lose weight in earnest, I wanted to put everything into it - unlike the previous attempts, this was gonna be my do or die moment. Fortunately, by educating myself and having all the time in the world to meal plan and workout (a small personal benefit of the pandemic), things clicked this time and I managed to lose 80lbs between June 2020 and January 2021 ([before and after pics here](http://imgur.com/a/vophosD)). 

By the time January rolled around, my weight loss slowed to a crawl. Even as I continued to lower my intake in relation to my lowering weight, it became harder and harder to make progress. I was stubborn, though, and the idea of taking a break felt like giving up or giving in to laziness. Finally, I started to feel weak during workouts and my performance suffered, so I decided to eat at maintenance during February and resume my weight loss in March (note: I maintained my same work out routine the entire time). Now that I've been eating at a deficit for a week, there's a few things I've noticed:

* You know that woosh of weight loss you see when you first start out? You can do that again after a break. I lost 7.5lbs my first week back at a deficit

* ""Normal"" portions seem so much bigger after eating at a deficit for so long. I was able to eat a balanced diet while also drinking normal soda and eating candy a few times a week. It's reassuring to know that when I'm satisfied with my weight and eat at maintenance for good, I can eat junk food every once in a while because I know how to budget calories and adjust my other meals to accommodate for something high in calories

* If you're worried about gaining on maintenance, know that you can restrict calories for a couple of days and get back to your ideal weight. I gained 4lbs in February (probably mostly water weight), and it took two days to get back to my lowest weight

* It's easier to eat at a significant deficit when you have a defined timeline; sometimes it's hard to stick to eating at a deficit when you don't know when the diet is going to end and you might start falling off and going over on your budget. I know I was more and more resistant to eating below 2000cal/day as I hit month eight of weight loss. Now that I've taken a break, I'm comfortable eating 1700cal/day until my end date in June

* You may be hungry again when you end your break and are eating significantly less. Thankfully, that goes away, as it always does when you get used to eating at a deficit

* Eating at maintenance did fix my workout issue. I was more energized when I ate more, and now at my current calorie budget, I can still workout at peak performance 

In closing, hopefully this helps people who are stubborn like me feel better about taking a break from eating at a deficit. It's not giving up or wasting time - it may actually make the process MORE efficient! I'm also going to try out ""refeeding"" by eating a controlled increase of carbs every other Sunday in order to encourage leptin production, which will hopefully prevent plateauing.

I'm not sure if any of you can help me, but I guess that, if I can't find the answer here, then I probably won't find it in any other community.

I'm looking for scientific evidence (scientific articles, studies) that are about measuring the calories spent by the body. How exactly are those calories measured? What techniques are used? Who did they study? When was it studied? What are the profiles of the people studied? How accurate is it? Are there discrepancies in the studies? And so on.

I expect, with the studies, to be able to completely understand HOW do they get to the point of indicating that a man in his 30 years and 170cm of height, sedentary, spends around 2.200 calories a day (just an example). I mean, I want to read the articles behind that.

I’ve given up so many times looking at the scale not budging, losing my resolve and going back to old comfortable habits. Don’t give up!! 

One thing I’ve realized is, it takes time to build up that momentum to lose weight. It took me a solid month before the pounds started just shedding off. But once you reach that sweet spot, the feeling is like no other! I’m still a little bit overweight BMI wise but I’m feeling so happy, with much more energy the best part is, I just eat in moderation so it’s not like I need to starve myself (which is awesome because I love food haha). 

For those who are interested to know, I started in December, this is my 3 month mark! I used to just run but I injured my knee so taking it a little easier by doing strength training with 3.5 lbs dumbbells. In addition to that, I just reduced the amount of junk food I ate, started eating a little more fish than chicken, and using a lot less oil / butter while cooking.","Hang in there, you’ll make it!","Hang in there, you’ll make it! Hey all! I’m 25F and 5’3”, SW: 153 lbs, CW: 144, GW: 130. Still got a long remainder of my weight loss journey. This is the lowest I’ve been since any weight loss undertaking of mine! I’ve given up so many times looking at the scale not budging, losing my resolve and going back to old comfortable habits. Don’t give up!! 

One thing I’ve realized is, it takes time to build up that momentum to lose weight. It took me a solid month before the pounds started just shedding off. But once you reach that sweet spot, the feeling is like no other! I’m still a little bit overweight BMI wise but I’m feeling so happy, with much more energy the best part is, I just eat in moderation so it’s not like I need to starve myself (which is awesome because I love food haha).

0,So I have been working out now for 3 months after doing a crash diet for 2 months (I know don’t tell me it was stupid but it got me started). I have been working out mostly cardio and eating right but with how much information there is out there I’m kinda lost. I have found the MET calculators and have look at them and putting them up with the lose it app. The calculator is telling me one thing and the lose it app another. So I am 25  6’4” male weighing in at 265. On an elliptical machine I am doing 12.4 METs. On the machine it says in 30 min I burn 570 calories. That’s with a 230 watts of continuous power. Then I did the calculator and it’s telling me I’m under by 200 calories. So it should be 730 or so. Depending on my weight. My weight has been going down I was 310 when I started. I don’t want to go over my calories so here I ask what is correct and any tips. I realize that I’m not going to be loosing massive amounts of weight a week I just want to make sure I’m getting my correct calories in because I’m eating 2000 atm but Netting 1700 to 1800 with the calories burned but I could be at 1300 to 1500 calories in reality and that’s very low and explains why I’m struggling. I work out 6 days a week 2 times a day for 3 hours total. Any help would be awesome in information or where to find good information. I want to learn as much as possible.

0,"for as long as I can remember I have been the milkshake queen , the smoothie queen , always trying the new drinks at different restaurants.  im currently on my weight loss journey and im doing what I would consider is dirty fasting.  here's what yesterday looked like for me 

430 am : coffee with almond milk and Splenda (ive been cutting down my sugar intake ) 
6 am : a bottle of water 
9 am : a bottle of water 
1130 am (lunch ) : a large coke from McDonald's (im slowly cutting out the soda ) 
1 pm : coffee with almond milk and Splenda 
530 pm  (dinner ) my grandad caught some pheasants so I made a crock pot pheasant stew the day before and let it simmer all day , no potatoes in it but heavy in the veggies , onions, carrots, celery,  zucchini,  since my calories are coming mostly from my drinking,  I allow myself to cook with more fat and didn't use the lower sodium broth  options .
630 pm : my brother and SIL came over on their way home and she is the world's best baker (honest to God my brother married Betty Crocker ) she made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies but she knew i was dieting so she made me some that were made with avocado , I ate 2 of them.  
7:  ""fasting "" starts again . 

my calorie intake was 998 yesterday,  however I did not feel tired , uncomfortable,  hungry 

I've been trying to hit the reccomended for women but when you're only eating solids once a day , its hard to hit that daily quota 




I guess what my big question of the day is ......what do you guys drink ? anyone have smoothie recipes or drink recipes that fill you up ?  what sort of meals should I be eating to make sure im meeting my caloric Intake and not heading down a path that could be detrimental to my health .

0,"Hi! It's me again lol. I've yo-yo'd back and forth so many times, and given up on diets, etc. But this workout and diet plan really seems to be sticking for me. I've lost about 20lbs in the past month, but the scale hasn't really budged this week. I've taken a couple of days to eat over calorie count so my body doesn't get used to a routine or think it's starving, but I don't go above 2000 calories when I do that. Right now, I work out every other day (and both days on the weekend so I stop sleeping in so late, it helps me with my college work). I do 35 minutes of 15 incline walking at 1.8mph and gradually lower it and speed it up after I pass the last 10 minute mark. After that, I do about 30 minutes of bench pressing, 105lbs, usually around 6 sets of 3 reps. Is it possible the scale hasn't moved much because of muscle gain? I've lost around 4-7 inches off my waist, and 5 off of my hip, so I know I'm definitely making progress. It's just frustrating to see it go up and down so much. It's something that in the past has caused me to quit, and I want to actually apply to be in the Navy, and I only have until next May realistically to hit 235. So there's no room for quitting for multiple months.  
\*\*\* I did play hockey (goalie) for the first time in months yesterday, my groin muscles are definitely very sore. Is it possible that the soreness is causing water retention right now?

Also, for the dinner calories, my friend wants to go to a sushi place. I was going to get a deep fried california roll with smoked salmon and eel sauce. Any possible estimate on what the calories for that would be? I can plan around it for the day so I don't go over 1400 calories, but I just want to see what I'm working with. I was estimating maybe 500? Sorry for the text wall!","Possible plateau? Also, can someone help me figure out dinner calories so I can go out with a friend on thursday??

0,"Hi everyone, I'm not sure where else to talk about this but considering it has to do with food and my diet I figured this might be an okay place.

Since my teenage years I've always very quickly felt weak if I didn't eat enough. Kind of light headed, but mostly that I just wasn't able to do much until I ate something again. I'm now 22 and this hasn't gone away, it's actually gotten a bit worse.

I've lost 20kg in the past 6 months and my diet is very different from what it used to be. I eat very little, but not because I want to. My body doesn't really give me the feeling of hunger anymore. Instead, I start feeling dizzy and weak. That's the moment I know I should eat. When I do eat, I eat what I can. It's not like I eat little on purpose, my body just can't take that much food anymore.

This has been very annoying, because if I don't get something to eat the moment I start feeling weak, it will only become worse. Eventually leading to me not being able to do anything, and having to be dependent on my boyfriend to get me something. This doesn't happen all the time, since I often just get food and it's okay. But this is still a problem. I start feeling weak so quickly, I don't feel like this is normal.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I can't help but wonder what's going on inside my body. I just want hunger cues again, not this annoying ""Oh guess I'm weak now"" feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Instead of getting hunger cues, my body starts feeling very weak, and the moment that happens I have to eat something immediately or I will be left not being able to do anything.

0,"You know that saying that men think about sex every seven seconds? I wish I had time for that, because I'm thinking about food every seven seconds instead.

I feel as though the thoughts only increase when I make efforts to cut calories and lose weight. Even know that I'm meal-prepping, I wish I could just decide what I'm having, make it, and kind of ""set it and forget it,"" but instead, I'm just thinking about the next recipe I should make, at what time I should eat my next meal, etc.

I used to think people were lying when they said things like ""sometimes I forget to eat."" How do you forget a literal biological function? Do you forget to shit, too? Forget to exhale? But with time, I realized that these people aren't humble-bragging about their virtue of moderation. They are just different from me, and many people exist for whom food is just another thing they have to do everyday, like brushing your teeth. I brush my teeth everyday, but don't think about it every moment of the day.

The only times I knew what it was like to not be thinking about food all the time were when I was on attention-related medications, like Adderall and Dexedrine. These literally caused me to forget to eat. And when I *did* eat, I'd have enough, be satisfied, and then move on to doing something other than eating. I'm still prescribed Dexedrine, but don't take it every day because I feel like I only need the boost in focus it gives me occasionally.

Right now, I am thinking about how the first thing I'm doing when getting home is having a sugar-free low-calorie Jell-O cup and a diet soda pop. A carbonated drink should fill my stomach up for a bit, and I'll be able to stay within my calorie deficit. Then I'll go to bed, because even if I think about food in my sleep, worst I can do is try to eat my pillow. But I know the amount I think about food isn't conducive to fat loss, because willpower is only so strong, and sooner or later, I'm going to crack.

0,"Hello, everyone. 

Last April, I weighed in at 174 pounds at 5’5. Since then, I’ve gotten down to 135 as of the end of February. To be honest, I have no clue where I want to end up. I’m thinking 130, but maybe I’ll get there and want to go more? I thought I would stop around 140, but here we are. 

Here’s the issue: as we are changing seasons, I have very little to wear. I’ve been wearing sweaters that still fit because they are more relaxed. I have one pair of slacks to wear to work that are too big around the waist. The two pairs of jeans I wear to work routinely sag and make my butt look awful. I’ve been dealing with my leggings slipping down while I jog for months. 

I keep telling myself that I’ll buy new clothes when I reach my goal weight. I set out with the intention of losing 5 pounds in March to get it over with for once and for all, but I can’t do it. The bulk of my loss happened in the first six months, then it slowed—as it does for everyone—as I got smaller. The last few months, I’ve been pretty casual at eating at a deficit and doing my daily activity, and I’ve been gradually losing. 

As I’ve tried ramping up my loss these last few weeks, I just can’t seem to do it. I have had some personal things happen that have been taking up too much mental real estate to to do the really hard deficit required to get through this in a short time frame. 

I’m in my first “professional” job, and I didn’t have a ton to wear before this, but now as the weather is heating up, I really don’t know what to wear. Not to mention, I don’t have any shorts that don’t look ridiculous for the weekends. 

I’m hesitant to buy clothes that will also be kind of ill-fitting if I do lose 5-10 pounds. While my husband and I make a decent amount of money, we are in the market for our first home and we’ve been squirreling away as much money as we can, so I feel like I don’t have a bunch of money to drop on any clothes that may need to be replaced in four months, but I want to look and feel nice at the same time. 

How have you all been replacing clothes as you’ve lost weight? Do you just deal with it until you get to the “end”? Do you thrift shop? Do you just buy a few cheap pieces to get you by?",Can’t decide if I want to buy new clothes,"Can’t decide if I want to buy new clothes Hello, everyone.

0,"Day 1 for the hundredth time. This is hard for me to write. 
I'm a 27 year old woman living in the US with an autoimmune condition causing arthritis.
I have failed at weight loss so many times that Ive developed a ""fuck it"" mentality. 
I'm posting here because I need help. 

I started in February 2018 at 250lbs. Using keto, I got down to 195 in October of 2018. I got engaged that month, and with the stress of the wedding, cake tastings, parties, etc, I was up to 220 at the wedding in September 2019. Here I am a year and a half later, back up to 240.4 as of yesterday morning. 
I have a ton of mental obstacles so I'm going to do my best to mention them all here, so that I can address all of them.

1) TikTok and body positivity. I am inundated with plus size women looking amazing, and when I see them, I think ""well if they look hot fat, maybe I do too!"" (Spoiler alert, I don't.) 
2) 
My cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose are all within the normal ranges. So when I think about losing weight, I tell myself ""WeLl I'm NoT tHaT uNhEaLtHy"" even though logically, I know those are definitely not the only measures of health. Same with seeing other people's posts with starting weights much higher than mine. I tell myself that I could be much heavier, which, while true, is not a high bar to set for myself.. 
3) I'm incredibly good at justifying things to myself. I always say ""well one X won't hurt"". I'm huge on the ""I can start for real tomorrow"".
4) I have an incredibly unhealthy relationship with food and I need to address this one the most. I look forward to food. I enjoy it. I get excited when I know I'm going out to eat, and I look up the menu in advance and get excited about what I'm going to get. Eating brings me a lot of happiness, and due to me being pretty fucking depressed often, I eat constantly because its one thing that consistently makes me happy. More than once, I've lied to my husband about wether or not I've had dinner, etc, because I know if I say I haven't eaten, I'll get to eat again. 

I'm trying to go back to the gym but I'm worried about covid, and I'm too lazy to stick to going on walks in my neighborhood daily even though I live in a great neighborhood. I feel like I need an intervention.

0,"Hello,

First of all, sorry if this is not the correct place to ask this question or if the question was asked before. I searched on Google and couldn't find anything relevant.

As a New Year resolution ( Yeah I know, cliche) I decided to use my extra time to get in shape instead of binge watching Netflix.

I am currently using the ""30 days whole body workout"" of ""30 days fitness"" (and another app before this one) and running 9-10 km five times a week.

I am pretty satisfied with the results after approximately  3 months. My arms and my chest look nice.

However, I am struggling with belly fat. I did lose some weight but apparently not enough.

I am not particularly eating healthy but I completely stopped consuming junk food, chocolates and coffee.

I was thinking of trying the 30 days abs workout challenge of the app and still run 9 km a day.

Is this good enough to have a flatter tummy or am I being delusional ?

Hey everyone!  I’m currently trying to hone my workout plan a bit.  For 8 weeks now I’ve been doing the Push Pull Legs workout 6 days a week without a hitch.  I added a few accessory lifts to each day and MonWedFri I added a 10 minute ab workout to the end of each workout.  So far it’s been good, but I’ve noticed I’ve actually put on about 15 pounds, and while muscle is a lot of that, I do have a high body fat percentage.  I’ve definitely changed my dieting to include more protein and not eat as much “crap” but I’m still seeing a gain in my stomach and I want to cut that down for sure.  I’m in the military and with no PT (thanks Covid) and wasting too much quarantine time I definitely let myself go a bit.  My wife and I broke down and bought a home gym with all the fixin’s so being able to workout at home has been a huge plus.

What I’m curious about is adding running as a way of cutting the fat while continuing some sort of lifting plan, not to mention its 1/3rd of the PT tests.  I’ve thought about doing morning runs on the 1.7 mile running trail loop in our neighborhood, or doing a SunTueThu Lifting - MonWedFri Running situation.  Just curious your take or anyone else experiencing a similar question.  I’m also wanting to add in more focus on push-ups, Situps, planking as well so come PT test time (July) I’ll knock it out of the park.

I started with ringfit for Nintendo switch. I haven’t injured myself so far and I quite like the variety and the pace. 
However! Today I decided to go for a jog. I jogged about 1.3 miles this morning. It’s not much but it’s the first time in about 10 months. I wanted to jog 2 miles but at 1 mile the itchy started again!! It was in my side fat and butt area where I guess i still carry a lot of fat. I wasn’t going to scratch myself in public and luckily I was doing laps round the neighborhood so I came home and felt sad that I got itchy again.

I guess I'm just here to rant about losing my motivation... and hoping some of you might help me gain it back.

In November and December, I lost 20 pounds and went from 165 (75 kg) to 145 (65 kg) (I'm F27, 5'7). Between holidays, birthdays etc. I've completely lost my motivation to follow the CICO diet. 

Initially, I was following the 4000 kj/day, and decided to give myself some slack with the 5000 kj/day, but I wasn't losing weight anymore. I guess that's where my motivation vaned, because I was restricting myself a lot still and it didn't work, so now I reversed back to my old habits of eating whenever and whatever. I haven't gained back any weight, as luck would have it, but I still have 5kg/10 pounds to go to and I can't seem to overcome my food impulses. 

I think, one of the problem is I like how I look now, and though I know I would look better with less weight, vanity was one of my main motivation at the beginning of the diet. 

I wanted to exercise to sculpt my body but gyms are closed right now, and I work best on machines. 

Is anyone else feeling this way ? Do you have any pointers to ""get back into the game"" ?",Losing motivation to follow CICO diet after 20lbs loss...,"Losing motivation to follow CICO diet after 20lbs loss... Hello everyone :)

In November and December, I lost 20 pounds and went from 165 (75 kg) to 145 (65 kg) (I'm F27, 5'7). Between holidays, birthdays etc. I've completely lost my motivation to follow the CICO diet. 

Initially, I was following the 4000 kj/day, and decided to give myself some slack with the 5000 kj/day, but I wasn't losing weight anymore. I guess that's where my motivation vaned, because I was restricting myself a lot still and it didn't work, so now I reversed back to my old habits of eating whenever and whatever. I haven't gained back any weight, as luck would have it, but I still have 5kg/10 pounds to go to and I can't seem to overcome my food impulses. 

I think, one of the problem is I like how I look now, and though I know I would look better with less weight, vanity was one of my main motivation at the beginning of the diet. 

I wanted to exercise to sculpt my body but gyms are closed right now, and I work best on machines. 

Is anyone else feeling this way ? Do you have any pointers to ""get back into the game"" ?"
0,"In August 2018, at only 4foot 7inches, I was 86kgs, prediabetic and the unhealthiest I’d been in my life. I decided I needed to make a change. At first I didn’t start with anything too dramatic. I reduced my food portions, ate less simple carbohydrates and exercised three to four times a week. At this point I was quite unfit and couldn’t do all that much in the way of exercise, but whenever I went to the gym I made sure that whatever I did, I would get my heart rate up and I’d make sure I was sweaty before I left. 

By August 2019, I had gotten down to 75kgs. Although it had taken me a year, I was so proud of what I had achieved and at that point, it was the healthiest and happiest I’d felt in my life. 

Throughout 2019 I continued with the healthier eating but became more stringent and focused on watching what I was eating and by this point could do a lot more fitness wise. I would run on the treadmill, go on long hikes, do lots of strength training. I tried lots of different things and found I enjoyed it all now that I was fitter. 

However in August of 2020 I’d plateaued at 66kgs. I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong. I never took a day off. I exercised every day for over two years and nothing worked. 

My GP suggested I try the Fast 800 program by Dr Michael Mosley. With this I would eat 800 calories a day within a 12 hour period. I did this from October to December and continued with my exercise but still I stayed at 66kgs. 

I feel like I’ve had every blood test done under the sun and nothing abnormal shows up. I’ve been to an endocrinologist. They can’t figure out why I’m not losing weight. I’ve looked a bit at theories around different body types and how if you’re an endomorph (which is how I would describe my body type) this can effect the way you lose weight. 

To say I’m at my wits end is an understatement. I can’t continue to maintain the momentum of reduced calories and strict exercise regime for my entire life. Especially when it’s no longer resulting in weight loss.

Been logging all of my food for over 60 days and getting little bits of exercise here and there (snowmobiling has been my go to).

I dont want to starve myself before dinner in the hopes I dont go over, but I cant have 3 cheat days a week. Since covid I spend A LOT of time at my familys house over the weekends and do not want to stop as I really dont have much going on on weekends.

I will track diligently for X weeks, eat healthy, etc. Then I'll get into a mood of craving sugar and sweets and eat them whenever I can (i.e. with lunch and dinner), then get back into tracking and the cycle repeats itself. As an example, I'll also eat things like pasta with alfredo and fries and burgers more often, and more foods I would avoid normally during the craving phase.

Today I had the biggest craving for a veggie burger with a ton of fries.

Then I thought to myself: all those simple carbs, grease, sodium, it’s not good for you. At the same time though, I didn’t want to completely deprive myself. So I decided to make a compromise. 

I got a veggie burger w/ a small fry (no buns), skipped out on burger sauces, shared the fries w/ my s/o. I actually ended up only eating about 1/3 of the fries because the veggie patty was super filling. I also had cucumbers, tomatoes, some grilled mushrooms and some water. 

Before, I’d eat bread, rice, desserts and sugary drinks all day. Now, I’m fighting back!

I am looking for a person to help hold me accountable for about 10-15 lbs of weight loss. Basically, in lockdown, I have gained a little weight and I would like to lose it so I feel less tight in my clothes and have a healthier BMI. I have been doing well enough most days on exercise but my diet is all over the place - some days I am a chickpea goddess and other days more of a hamentaschen gourmand. :). It’s hard being a vegetarian sometimes as I replace meat with carbs.  I do 30 minute workouts/yoga during the week for strength training, long walks, and occasional runs. 

I guess I’m looking for someone who I can, maybe once a day, PM about weigh ins or diet, just so I feel like I should be more consistent. I’d do the same for you of course, praising lavishly for trying to be a bit healthier!  You go, girl (or dude)! 

Anyway, let me know if you think we could be a good fit.

So I don’t know if this will really help anyone, but I had a bit of a moment today that I thought I would share.

I’ve lost and regained hundreds and hundreds of pounds over the decades, but this most recent time I really took a different approach.  I decided that I would stick to it come hell or high water.  I would read everything I came across, and I would try every strategy.  So I did.  If I came across a motivational tool, I did it even if I thought it sounded dumb.  I had sticker charts (that didn’t last long), rewards written down for milestones (I owe myself SO MANY rewards), the two jars of marbles (I like that one better than I thought I would), progress pictures, everything.  You name it, I gave it a try.  Some I enjoyed more than I thought I would, some I stopped doing.

Well, I had forgotten that I made a “dream board.”  That’s not really my thing, but I had promised myself to try everything.  I made it as a private board on Pinterest, and it has pictures of all of the things that I could think of that were my motivations when I first started.  I did look at it a bit when I was struggling at first, but then as I got better coping skills, I stopped looking at it and forgot about it completely.

Today I came across it.  Looking through it, I have either archived or am able to achieve almost everything on it.  There are some things I haven’t actually done, but my weight is no longer a barrier to doing it.  For example, I really want to go sky diving.  Well now it’s just a matter of going out and doing it, instead of it being something I physically couldn’t do.  

If I’m being honest, when I made that board, I don’t know that I really thought I would do those things.  But being able to look back and see the things I wanted SO BAD and know that they’re within my grasp is a pretty amazing feeling. 

So the moral of my story is to try things that you think won’t help.  You might be surprised.",Don’t be afraid to be silly or cheesy,"Don’t be afraid to be silly or cheesy F/36/5’6”  SW:355 CW:189

Yesterday I decided for the 10th time since the beginning of the pandemic to get back on CICO. A bit of background: I'm a 46 year old dad of a 6 y.o. kid, and I've been overweight since my early teens, and obese since the early 20s. I found this sub on 2016 or so, and on late 2017 I decided to give CICO and C25K a shot, and managed to go down from 125kg to 106kg in 18 months, slow and steady. Joined a ton of 5k and 10k races and even a half marathon in August 2019 in which I finished nearly last, but I finished it. In late 2019 I started to fall off the wagon a bit but I was certain I'd get back on track in early 2020, and then covid showed up.

Fast forward to now and I'm pretty much back to square zero. I'm not sure about my weight as I'm afraid to check, but I'm sure it's over 120kg.

Looking my self at the mirror last Friday night I decided to get serious again about calorie tracking. And then today my mother in-law (we're in the isolation bubble with my in-laws to get support while my wife and I work from home) who usually cooks or orders the most tempting food decided to cook my favorite dessert, a typical Brazilian dessert (pudim de leite). It was tough to see that thing tempting me all day.

My main strategy was to pick up a book I've read in 2017, Amy Johnson's ""The little book of Big change"", and remind me that an urge is just a thought, not an order or a reason to try to ""out think"" it. It's an habitual thought which is best when it's simply discarded as new thoughts will come, our brain is a constant, random thought generator. It seemed to have helped.

Anyway this post turned out to be a long rambling. In any case here's for day 2 of my journey, I hope I have the strength to stick to it.

I realise this isn’t a great deal of weight, however I’ve been trying to lose it for a while now and the same thing keeps happening. 

I do good for 3-5 days, under my calorie goal, then the hunger and the need for crappy food sets in. Once I decide I want it then there’s no stopping me. 

I’m also a massive emotional eater and recently my job has been extremely stressful, that along with some other health issues and my stress has sky rocketed - along with my emotional eating. 

I will frequently binge - usually in the evenings - and immediately afterwards I feel awful, even more sad and stressed than I started.

I realise this isn’t a great deal of weight, however I’ve been trying to lose it for a while now and the same thing keeps happening. 

I do good for 3-5 days, under my calorie goal, then the hunger and the need for crappy food sets in. Once I decide I want it then there’s no stopping me. 

I’m also a massive emotional eater and recently my job has been extremely stressful, that along with some other health issues and my stress has sky rocketed - along with my emotional eating. 

I will frequently binge - usually in the evenings - and immediately afterwards I feel awful, even more sad and stressed than I started.

I'm having some issues with plateauting and I could really use some advice.

Some context, I started this journey back to being more active and healthier at the middle of this entire global situation, where I moved back home for a bit. I started off at 5'8, 210, never really looking too overweight (I think it's because I have super thick muscular thighs and calves without ever doing leg days) but I wanted to get back to a healthier BMI and body fat %. 

Since September, I'm sitting around 188 (hasn't dropped past 187)  through a combined effort of daily 2 mile walks and just eating cleaner and healthier. I also suspect not drinking much at all contributed as well.

Over the past month, I've had debilitating sciatica and haven't been able to move much, much less go on walks. The kettlebell and dumbbells I purchased have just been sitting in my room because my leg pain is way too much for me to handle right now.

Hi everyone! First time making a post here, but I've been lurking for quite some time. Around the early part of 2018 I got out of a long relationship and was at my heaviest weight of 265. 

I committed to losing weight that summer and was able to lose about 70 pounds doing IF 16:8 \~1500-1800 calories a day and getting into the gym 5 days a week doing cardio on an elliptical and lifting weights for about a half hour. I hadn't really had much experience in a gym so for my lifting I would alternate between upper body/ lower body and do 4 sets of 8 on 5 different machines/ exercises. 

After the summer I went back to school and stopped working out and watching what I ate and subsequently gained back 10-15 pounds. The next summer came and I once again committed to getting back into the gym and losing some more weight. Although I did manage to lose the weight I gained, my eating habits were all over the place and I stayed around 195-200 pounds. 

Fast forward to March 2020 and COVID hits. I move back in with my parents to save some money and pick up running because gyms are all closed and I have unlimited free time essentially. I ran my first 10k in July and then my first half-marathon in September!! This time around I'm not doing any lifting though. At this point I'm steadily losing weight from running and IF 16:8 and managed to get down to around 170 pounds. Then about a month after my half-marathon I pulled a muscle and was off for a few months, subsequently gaining back 15 pounds. 

I picked up running again in December, and now am at the point where I'm lifting 5 days a week and running 25 miles a week. I still would like to lose some more weight, and get somewhere between 160-165. Once I get there I can switch my focus to lifting more, eating in a surplus, and putting on some muscle! 

The biggest thing I've learned throughout all of this is that weight loss is not always a linear progression. There are lots of bumps in the road, but the most important thing is that you pick yourself up and get back on the wagon! My quality of life has improved so much. I can do everyday activities without getting tired! Also, at least for me, obsessing over calories has never worked.

0,"A little bit of backstory: I've been gaining and losing the same twenty lbs for about the last 7 years, basically since my first kid was born. 

This past November, I found myself once again at 165. I decided to make a change - a real change. I don't eat breakfast, eat basically chicken, rice and veggies for lunch and dinner, no snacks, drinking nothing but 2 cups of black coffee in the morning and water throughout the day.

I don't track my calories as strictly anymore, because I've been doing it long enough I can kind of just tell since I eat the same thing every day. 

In mid January, I was officially diagnosed with adhd, and got put on adderall. It's basically changed my life (just being able to DO things is amazing) and I have been doing better at my work and keeping up on house things. All and all, things are going awesome right now, and I will probably hit my goal weight in another 3 weeks to a month!

I stopped by my parents to say hi, and mentioned how excited I am - not only did I blow past 145 (my nemesis weight I haven't been able to get past) I am officially in the 130's, which I don't think I've seen since my freshman year of college.

My Mom says something along the lines of ""well of course you're able to lose weight, it's a side effect of adderall!""

0,"Hi everyone,

Been a member of this sub for a while, I love reading stories of how far people have come on their weight loss journeys, every time I read them I think I really need to try, but after a few days I lose the motivation.

I’m 26 about 5”9 weighing in at 330lbs. I know, it’s really not good. I’ve struggled with my weight my entire life, in school I topped 16st but managed to lose it by basically hardly ever eating and exercising a lot, my motivation at the time was I was fed up of being bullied. 

This is the biggest I have ever been, and I know it’s only a small amount of time now before I end up with a serious health condition (diabetes) because of it. 
A few years ago I tried keto, and was doing really well and then got pregnant, I had heard that losing weight during pregnancy wasn’t good so I went back on carbs. I still ended up losing weight during pregnancy, bad morning sickness. 
Once I had my little girl in May 2019 I’ve just piled on the lbs, then all these lockdowns too I’ve been working from home and hardly exercising at all. 

I cannot stand the way I look now, and I know that even once I’ve lost all the weight I will have so much excess skin. I’m scared of how big I am, and scared of how gross I’ll still look when all the weight is gone. 

I need to do this, I kept promising I would when I had my baby, and I just never properly tried. I don’t want her to ever end up like me, or even motherless when I eat myself into an early grave.
My size has been impacting my relationship for years, my partner is loyal and loving he would never intentionally upset me, but I know he is so worried for me. To try and motivate me to lose weight he said I need to get down to 17st before we can start trying again, I was annoyed at first, but I get why, he knows how much I want a big family and that it should motivate me to lose weight. It did at first, but then again I just stopped. I have no excuses really, I’m ashamed of myself, when I really think about it I often cry so I guess I try to just push it out of my mind. 

Any advice you can give me to stick with it is hugely appreciated. Thank you for reading.",I need to change,"I need to change Hi everyone,

I didn't worry much knowing I could just cico those calories later on, a small bump on the long road.

Now, I know the reality, I'm planning on losing over forty kilo's (88lbs) to start with and continue even more once I hit my current goal weight, I'm going to have some, if not a LOT of loose skin, and frankly, I'm okay with that. I'd rather look like Zoidberg with my shirt off than what I am currently, and I can look into surgeries from that point if it does affect me horribly, but I was wondering if at my age and current weight, that sort of skin treatment would have any noticeable effect along the way."

I(18f) started following a calorie deficit(1200cal) from mid December and within the first 6 weeks I was able to reduce 4 kgs without any exercise(didn’t have time cause exams) 

Now since the start of feb, I’ve been cycling 30-40 mins(300-400cal) for 4-5 days a week while eating 1200-1300cal and my weight has not dropped even one kilo in over a month 

My starting weight was 72kgs (159lbs), 
currently I am 68kgs (150lbs) and 
my goal weight is 58kgs (127lbs) to reach an healthy bmi for my height (156cm)

Also where I live all the gyms are close so that’s not an option, neither do I have much equipment at home 

Any advice?",advice to lose weight,"advice to lose weight

1. write/rewrite some concrete goals;

3. plan meals and cook them (this seemed to be the largest different when I got this really going a few months ago);

3.1 - try to increase protein

Stay within calorie range (1800): Partner's birthday, maintenance. This first week was a bit of a wash on this front. 2/2 days.

Exercise 5 days a week: Gentle walk along a scenic over view path. Would like to have gone longer but it was sunshiny &amp; lovely. 7/7 days.

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, nonfood rewards): Started a really interesting book called ""The Only Good Indians"". Also finished another book this week. Keeps the wheels of my brain turning on productive things.

Try a new recipe once a week: Roasted romanesco &amp; sausage sammiches with grilled veggies. New sausage cooking method &amp; new types of sautéed veggies, new cooking method &amp; sammich, I say it counts! 2/4 weeks.

0,"I’ve been on this current weight loss journey since a few months before the pandemic. I maintained my loss last year while the gyms were shut down, and then restarted things a couple months ago. I was doing so well, and I managed to get below 200. That was such a huge goal for me and I was so excited about it! I felt so motivated to keep doing what I was doing - CICO, getting 10k steps per day, and weight training a few days a week.

I’ve been in a little bit of a funk for a few weeks, but have been able to push through fairly well. Then, last week, something completely unrelated to weight loss tanked a day I had set aside for self care. After that, I’ve been struggling hard. Last weekend I went over my maintenance calories by a little bit. I was so upset about it for a while but was able to pull it together, take it in stride, and told myself I would just do better the rest of the week. Well, for whatever reason, this week I just can’t seem to get it together.

The scale isn’t moving because I’m not meeting my calorie goals. A few of the days, I went over maintenance. I’m feeling VERY lackluster when I go to the gym, which is just not like me. I’ve been getting such bad anxiety that I’ve gone to the gym three times and haven’t been able to get out of my car. It’s getting easier to stay home and easier to not care about my deficit. I keep panicking that I’m already falling off the bandwagon and that I’ll never actually reach my goal. I realistically know that a bad week is totally normal. I just can’t shake it. I feel like such a failure. I basically maintained or had a small deficit this week. 

I can look at all of this logically and just see a rough week... but it feels like the beginning of the end. I’ve been trying to lose weight my entire life, and I always ended up failing. I’m just terrified of failing again - I have been feeling so confident since last year that I’m really going to meet my goals. This week I just doubt all of it, but I’m shooting myself in the foot by not going to the gym and not eating in a deficit.

0,"So the title says most of it anyway.  I'm a big loser like many people here  and about to get a tummy tuck/abdominoplasty.  I've done a lot of legwork with the process and wanted to share some of the pitfalls and successes I've had in terms of planning the surgery, finding a surgeon, costs/paying for surgery, and even how to determine if you should have the surgery (IMHO).

As a precursor, **know that you're actually ready.**  Are you at your goal weight or a healthy weight?  Has your weight been stable (i.e. 1-2 years min)?  Do you know what it is you want to accomplish with a tummy tuck?  Is what you're seeing actually loose skin or simply excess fat?  Does what you see bother you enough you'd want to undergo surgery to correct it? 

If you're still obese and considering getting the tummy tuck, please keep going until you reach a normal BMI.  You owe it to yourself and a tummy tuck is not going to reveal a magical body underneath.  IMO if you've lost enough weight to have loose skin, you 100% have the capacity to get to a truly healthy weight.  If you still find yourself binging or emotional eating despite being at a healthy weight - this was huge for me - you also need to ask yourself if it's the right time.  If your weight loss was less dramatic, is what you're seeing really loose skin?  A tummy tuck scar can be 8"" or around your hips.  Is it worth going under the knife for that?

So after that disclaimer, tips for surgery...

1. **Shop surgeons.**  I ended up getting 4 consults and paid $300 - $150 of which was non-refundable.  Absolutely glad I did it.  You pay a consult fee and it's applied to the surgery if you go with that surgeon; if not, you lose it.  Seeing 4 doctors let me know whose prices were in line and whose weren't - I'll get more to that soon.  Seeing 4 doctors also let know which tummy tuck to decide on (e.g. mini, standard, extended, body lift/belt lipectomy).  It's never bad to have a second opinion, if only to confirm.  And one of the doctors I was appalled by so...
2. **Plan.**  Taking medical leave through work, applying for Short Term Disability (if applicable), arranging for a caretaker, medical followups - all take a lot of time.  Your back-to-work time might be anywhere from 2-8 weeks depending on your procedure.  If you're only getting loose skin removed (panniculectomy) with liposuction (included in the procedure cost), you're looking at a few weeks recovery - this is for all the big losers.  If you're getting abdominal muscle repair, you'll be out much longer - this is primarily women from childbirth.  You'll need a caretaker for your first week or two.  Meal prep is a good thing.  
3. **Consider all the costs and how you'll pay.**  I'm in the U.S. and my procedure is being performed domestically.  My 4 quotes in a major Northeastern city as of late 2020 average slightly under $11k for abdominoplasty without muscle repair in a surgical center.  Doctors' offices will frequently give you the option of having the procedure in a surgery center or a hospital.  Regardless of the decision, the procedure is outpatient and lasts about 3-4 hours.  A surgery center will cost anywhere from $1k-$2k less than the hospital. Abdominoplasty with muscle repair will cost more.  Insurance will not cover your procedure.  You realistically cannot obtain pre-authorization before your surgery either, unless you want to fight for it years ahead of time.  Insurance will only cover panniculectomies (loose skin removal) in cases of EXTREME weight loss that include skin irritations leading to chronic infection.  Quality of life considerations do not come into play.  Most plastic surgeon's offices are not set up for medical insurance billing and will tell you upfront they will help you with whatever documentation you'll need, but that the fight is yours.   


The  biggest expense besides the surgery is lost pay.  I'm fortunate in that my Short Term Disability policy covers all elective surgeries.  Most seem like they don't, but it doesn't hurt to inquire.  STD pays a fraction of your average wage after you've been out of work for a certain amount of days (the benefit doesn't start immediately).  

**I hope this next part helps people, because it's shaved thousands of dollars off my total costs had I not done otherwise.  (I didn't invent capitalism.)**

I recognize that this piece won't help everyone.  The surgery itself is obviously a stretch purchase for the vast majority of folks.  Here's what I'd recommend if your situation is similar to mine.

I saved for the entire procedure (including lost pay) and was going to pay in cash, but I'm paying with credit cards instead.  If you have good credit and can afford the surgery outright, consider doing the same.  Don't get 0% financing or financing through the doctor's office.  This has helped me shave about $3k from my total bill.  

Credit card sign up offers are golden.  You might get an offer that reads, ""Spend $1,000 in the first month, get $200 cashback!"" or something similar.  They're all the same; spend money X in 90 days and get reward Y.

I put all of my regular expenses on credit cards anyway - easier to track, I get rewards, better purchase protection.  I spend $2k a month on average.  But to be clear, I pay everything in full each month, so I carry no balance.  So if you're planning a $11k surgery and have credit card expenses of $2k per month like me, you're looking at $17k in 90 days.  How many credit cards can I sign up for then?  I got 6 with an 800 credit score, but in theory anything about 750 should be fine.  With all my bonus offers, minus a few with annual fees, I netted a little under $2,000.  

Running multiple credit cards is going to result in multiple hard inquiries.  This typically hurts people's credit.  I did NOT hurt mine.  This is why:

Credit score formulas are complicated and opaque, but basically you're judged off of different metrics with different degrees of importance.  Paying on time is by far number one with something like number of accounts coming in last.  Another key aspect is your utilization ratio.  Basically, the less of your available credit you use (outstanding amounts/all credit card spending limits), the better your score.  Even with 6 hard inquiries on my credit, my score did not go down.  The credit limits on my new cards caused my utilization to plummet, offsetting the dip from the inquiries (evidently).  YMMV.  

I did all the applications online in rapid fire and got instant approvals.  This part helps A LOT.  I link all my bills through PayPal.  Pay for your recurring bills through PayPal and set up a new card as the default.  Pay for all your physical purchases on this card until you hit the minimum spend amount and then pay off the card entirely.  Repeat this process for the next card and the next until your surgery.  Once your surgery fees are due - typically two weeks prior to surgery - ask the surgeon to split the cost among your remaining cards that still need to hit the minimum to receive the bonus.  With proper planning and financials, you shouldn't have to pay a dime in interest.

For me, STD benefits are direct deposit and eligible for new account bonuses in the same way credit cards are, ""Make X amount in direct deposits in 90 days and receive reward Y!"".  The online portal that administers my benefits is insanely easy with direct deposit, I can actually set up multiple accounts with defined contributions per week.  So I opened up 5 checking accounts with a $200 average bonus for $500 direct deposits in 90 days (or $2,500 in 90 days for all 5 total).  $100 per week from STD benefits into each account will cover me after 5 weeks, for an additional bonus of $1,000.  

Total ""savings"" of $3k.  The pitfalls to watch out for are making sure you aren't paying monthly fees on the checking accounts or annual fees on the credit cards.  Also, pay your entire statement off.  If you were gonna pay upfront, you already have the money.  

Tangent:  I've learned a lot about credit cards and checking accounts too.  They're definitely not all created equal.  If you find a financial product you like, stick with it and don't just cancel once you've gotten your intro bonus.  Similarly, don't hold onto a bad product; you tried it and it didn't work out.  Don't feel bad, it's competition among banks looking for your money.

Good luck, losers.",I'm at the end of my 100 pound weight loss journey and my excess skin is coming off soon! Here's some advice about the surgery to other big losers who might be contemplating it themselves.,"I'm at the end of my 100 pound weight loss journey and my excess skin is coming off soon! Here's some advice about the surgery to other big losers who might be contemplating it themselves. So the title says most of it anyway.  I'm a big loser like many people here  and about to get a tummy tuck/abdominoplasty.  I've done a lot of legwork with the process and wanted to share some of the pitfalls and successes I've had in terms of planning the surgery, finding a surgeon, costs/paying for surgery, and even how to determine if you should have the surgery (IMHO).

As a precursor, **know that you're actually ready.**  Are you at your goal weight or a healthy weight?  Has your weight been stable (i.e. 1-2 years min)?  Do you know what it is you want to accomplish with a tummy tuck?  Is what you're seeing actually loose skin or simply excess fat?  Does what you see bother you enough you'd want to undergo surgery to correct it? 

If you're still obese and considering getting the tummy tuck, please keep going until you reach a normal BMI.  You owe it to yourself and a tummy tuck is not going to reveal a magical body underneath.  IMO if you've lost enough weight to have loose skin, you 100% have the capacity to get to a truly healthy weight.  If you still find yourself binging or emotional eating despite being at a healthy weight - this was huge for me - you also need to ask yourself if it's the right time.  If your weight loss was less dramatic, is what you're seeing really loose skin?  A tummy tuck scar can be 8"" or around your hips.  Is it worth going under the knife for that?

So after that disclaimer, tips for surgery...

1. **Shop surgeons.**  I ended up getting 4 consults and paid $300 - $150 of which was non-refundable.  Absolutely glad I did it.  You pay a consult fee and it's applied to the surgery if you go with that surgeon; if not, you lose it.  Seeing 4 doctors let me know whose prices were in line and whose weren't - I'll get more to that soon.  Seeing 4 doctors also let know which tummy tuck to decide on (e.g. mini, standard, extended, body lift/belt lipectomy).  It's never bad to have a second opinion, if only to confirm.  And one of the doctors I was appalled by so...
2. **Plan.**  Taking medical leave through work, applying for Short Term Disability (if applicable), arranging for a caretaker, medical followups - all take a lot of time.  Your back-to-work time might be anywhere from 2-8 weeks depending on your procedure.  If you're only getting loose skin removed (panniculectomy) with liposuction (included in the procedure cost), you're looking at a few weeks recovery - this is for all the big losers.  If you're getting abdominal muscle repair, you'll be out much longer - this is primarily women from childbirth.  You'll need a caretaker for your first week or two.  Meal prep is a good thing.  
3. **Consider all the costs and how you'll pay.**  I'm in the U.S. and my procedure is being performed domestically.  My 4 quotes in a major Northeastern city as of late 2020 average slightly under $11k for abdominoplasty without muscle repair in a surgical center.  Doctors' offices will frequently give you the option of having the procedure in a surgery center or a hospital.  Regardless of the decision, the procedure is outpatient and lasts about 3-4 hours.  A surgery center will cost anywhere from $1k-$2k less than the hospital. Abdominoplasty with muscle repair will cost more.  Insurance will not cover your procedure.  You realistically cannot obtain pre-authorization before your surgery either, unless you want to fight for it years ahead of time.  Insurance will only cover panniculectomies (loose skin removal) in cases of EXTREME weight loss that include skin irritations leading to chronic infection.  Quality of life considerations do not come into play.  Most plastic surgeon's offices are not set up for medical insurance billing and will tell you upfront they will help you with whatever documentation you'll need, but that the fight is yours.   


The  biggest expense besides the surgery is lost pay.  I'm fortunate in that my Short Term Disability policy covers all elective surgeries.  Most seem like they don't, but it doesn't hurt to inquire.  STD pays a fraction of your average wage after you've been out of work for a certain amount of days (the benefit doesn't start immediately).  

**I hope this next part helps people, because it's shaved thousands of dollars off my total costs had I not done otherwise.  (I didn't invent capitalism.)**

Hello! I just wanted to share my experience to see if it might be helpful to anyone here! I've always had a hard time convincing myself to stay on diet or exercise plans because even as I put on 40 extra pounds, with my height and build it hides itself pretty well. I was feeling the extra pounds though, and I've wanted to get back to where I was before my poor food choices in college got me where I have been the last few years. 

It was a cycle I'm sure we're all familiar with, start, go strong, get distracted or discouraged and lose all the progress. Then do it again a in month or so.

But recently I decided to start over, and I decided to take it one thing at a time. Start with only a focus on calories in vs out and make sure I'm staying in a deficit. So here's where the mind game started. 

Last time I tried, I set a small deficit goal and I had a hard time keeping it. I would either severely undershoot it and starve and then I would bounce back and overshoot the next day and so I wasn't making any sort of consistent progress and I gave up before too long. 

But this time, I outsmarted myself. I set a deficit goal of 1000 calories a day, which is massive for me, knowing it would be tough to keep, but setting such an intense goal for myself allows me to push myself towards that big goal, but even if I miss it or have a day that I feel like I need more, I still wind up with an average of 300-500 deficit a day, sometimes more. It lets the part of my brain who wants to get away with eating more than my goal get what it wants, while letting the rational part of my brain still accept that progress is being made because I'm still in deficit and losing weight. 

It works for me because it includes my tendency to cheat on my diet into my plans and ""outsmarts"" myself. 

I don't know if that would be helpful for anyone else, but I've managed to drop nearly 10 pounds in the last month or so and I'm happy with the progress!

0," (F/29/5'1; starting weight; 128; current weight: 115 lb; current body fat %: 22.7; goal weight: 109 lb; goal body fat %: 19.0)

I have been on a weight loss journey since Sept 2020. I have reached my goal weight in December, but I was able to easily gain the weight back little by little.

**Here is my activity level:**

* I work in a desk for 6 hrs a day.
* After work, I take a walk for about 1.5 hrs- trying to at least get 11,000 steps a day. I try to do this everyday except for when there's a bad weather.
* After walk, I always do some kind of resistance training plus HIIT. I do this 5 days out of the week.

I mildly started resistance training about a month ago, but about a week ago, I completely overhauled my workout schedule alternating the days with leg, glutes, upper body.

**My diet:**

I first started with 1200 calories per day then reduced to 1100 a day, and this allowed me to reach 109. When I started to gain more weight, I went back to 1100, but it wasn't sustainable anymore (crazy hunger, and weak performance while working out).

* Now I eat about 1280 calories which is still in a deficit, but I'm gaining weight/fat. My clothes are starting to get tighter especially around my armpit area, but my belly is still on the slim side.
* I try to keep my macros to this ratio: 4 (carbs128g): 3(protein 96g): 3(fat 43g).
* I used to have cheat days once a week, but now I don't even do this anymore.
* I don't eat a lot of processed foods. I eat nuts, yogurt, berries, rice cakes, and two Bouchard dark chocolates as snacks.
* I drink one glass of green tea a day, and at least 2L of water a day.

**My overall goal:**

I'm not just solely looking for my weight to go down. I'm working towards to see more muscle definition, but I have excess fat especially around my upper back and lower belly right under the belly button. I am just so confused as to why I am gaining fat rather than losing... Any advice?

I know that many of you look for motivation so here is a list of reasons, from my personal wins, beyond the scale:

\- So I have a super flat face and I noticed esp in photos it would look so weird. Photos are all about the angles and I had none. Furthermore, my eyelids were thin and crepey, my skin was soft and sagging, and my cheeks looked heavy. Turns out, having enough electrolytes, water and minimal sugar, carbs and dairy, gives your facial skin wayyyyy more bounce. I specify facial skin because it \*is\* very different to body skin. Since my bone structure is so flat, now I'm even more keen to see how it will look once I've lost a fuckton of fat. 

\- My body skin! Listen, I'll be open and honest and say I already started with flawless Asian skin, and being a skincare addict, I have worked on that for yearsssss. Nevertheless, I was delighted to see further improvement, that my pores are tighter, my skin is smoother, the texture is creamier

\- My long-standing interest in skincare was really about chemistry: how does Chemical X result in Improvement Y on your skin? So when I started the health kick, I was mostly interested in the nutrition. I found motivation in the science, which is great cos I wasn't just counting the scales, which honestly hasn't moved much over 1 month. Finding an interest in this has been a win cos 1. it's interesting lol and 2. helps keep me on the wagon 

\- My gut health has improved: ah its kinda gross how I know this, but basically stools lol. Also, I just \*feel\* better in my gut. This is highly important to me because I think the gut is possibly the most important part of my health and I like to keep my microbes happy. 

\- My ass is firmer 

\- I eat for nutrition, not just calories. Calories are absolutely not all the same, and I am still trying to replace my godforsaken packet chips (have reduced tho). Food that has enzymes, nutrients, fatty acids, antioxidants, are going to beat ones that don't 

\- I am making my limited budget go further, with less 

\- My apartment smells nice, because it smells like fresh food 

\- I make small, but sustainable, improvements. I post in the Daily Victories thread almost every single day. I like making a change and tracking it's impact on me, so that I know if it benefits me, which motivates me. And if it doesn't work for me eg nuts for reasons, then I can go okay now I know. Either way, it allows me to see the real time impact rather than waiting for the scales, and helps prevent fatigue 

\-  I balance eating for fuel and pleasure. Fresh fruit and skinny cream are one of the favourite things in the world. 

\- I get value from making better choices for my exercise, diet, and wallet. Knowing that it's a better decision gives me the immediate feedback that gives me that dopamine hit everyone wants!

0,"I’m posting here because my friends don’t really care that much/encourage me but I (21F) have lost 18 lbs since Dec 31st! I was extremely depressed in the fall (have struggled with it on and off for years) and as a result I was drinking heavily, working out less, and eating whatever I wanted. As a result of that I gained nearly 30 lbs from spring to fall of 2020, and I’m really proud of the steps I’ve taken to get healthy. 

I finally found a med combination that’s improved my depression considerably (also depresses appetite, which helps a bit with the weight loss) and since it’s started working I’ve found the motivation to work out more often and cut my drinking down significantly, which I consider a huge win because I’m in college and go to a HUGE party school. Drinking and drunk eating was my biggest problem, but I’ve also decreased portion sizes since I started this. I’m not sure what the form is for listing stats here, but here’s my journey so far:

5’6” 21F SW: 187.7 lbs CW: 169.2 lbs GW: Under 160 (155 would be ideal) 

I still have a bit to lose but it looks like I should be where I want to be in another two months! My fitness has greatly improved- I’m running a LOT faster and having better workouts, and my old clothes are fitting again, though I still don’t want to go shopping anytime soon 😅 I’ve always had a “bigger” or “thicker” build, but I realized that having that much weight just wasn’t healthy and I’m so glad I’m on this journey.

0,"Hi everyone! I'm a 26 year old male, measure about 5' 7.5"", and weigh in at 146.4 lbs. 

I've always struggled with my weight. Growing up, i was always chubby. To rectify that, i joined swim teams but didn't see a meaningful change - probably bc of my diet (i love pizza and everything carby). Things changed when i got a personal trainer who introduced me to weight lifting and told me to cut all the crap out.

Fast forward to today, i work a desk job (get like 5-6hrs/night of sleep on avg) and have quite a sedentary lifestyle. The only exercise i get is through the few times i go to the gym. Before the start of the year i didn't really track calories or watch my macros.

I've recently decided that it's the perfect time for me to ""lean"" up bc of COVID and all the time home. Also, my friends want to do a week trip to Hawaii, which is the main impetus for my recent drive. I've been counting my calories and actively trying to increase my protein intake. I avg about 90-100g of protein, 160-200g of carbs, and 15-20g of fat. Calorie goal of ~1,700 calculated by MyFitnessPal. I'm vegetarian (no meat, no fish, no egg) by religion so protein intake is always a challenge and my diet skews heavier to carbs (legumes, fruits, like everything else).

Despite my efforts (both now and historically), I'd say my body look is more like skinny fat. All my fat is stored in my gut (and some back fat); my legs are very lean looking. Not sure if it's because of a weak core but my stomach is ALWAYS hanging out. I only ""look"" skinny/fit when i flex my core and my stomach sort of pulls in. I'd say there is some noticable muscle definition in the arms area. Can't see my abs or anything really. I tell my friends i need to lose weight and they look at me like I'm crazy.

I've used those body scales that tell you your body fat %. Research seems to indicate they're not accurate at all? They usually give me a range of 16%-17%. Using the ""eye test"", I'd say 20% bc of my gut area sticking out but i know I should be somewhere in between there, give how skinny i look elsewhere (at least to me). 

My goal is to get leaner/burn this fat off while hopefully building some muscle definition (hopefully by the summer or at least make meaningful progress), but I'm not sure how to do that. It's like a dream of mine to have that summer beach body (if i flex my core i can for sure feel the muscle definition underneath; it's just buried under the top layer of fat). I lift chest/shoulder/bicep when i go. I know i should have a balance and do triceps/back/legs/abs. I'm wondering if any of you have any advice for me? I'm not sure if i need to be lifting more often, more variety in terms of body parts I'm hitting, more weight/stress on the body, incorporate cardio? (Which is non existent right now), cut even more calories?, Etc. 

I would appreciate any advice/guidance/tips!",26M - Long term weight loss struggle - looking for advice,"26M - Long term weight loss struggle - looking for advice Hi everyone! I'm a 26 year old male, measure about 5' 7.5"", and weigh in at 146.4 lbs.

0,"Hi all, 

I am a 5'7"" female who has always struggled with weight. For reference, I was 5'3"" and weighed 135 lbs when I was 10. In high school I held the same weight all throughout, at roughly 185 lbs. I've gained a lot of weight over the pandemic and I'm at my wit's end trying to lose it. 

My biggest limiting factor with dieting is that I have Celiac disease, so I have to be 100 percent gluten free. I've been doing some workout videos at home, and my usual go-tos are dance workouts and low-impact cardio because I don't have any equipment or a gym membership. I lost about 15 lbs when I first went gluten free 2 years ago, but I've gained it all back and then some in the past 18 months. 

I don't want to do any fad diets. I tried intermittent fasting for a few weeks and hated it because I felt so obsessive over clocking my eating time that it really overtook my life. (I also didn't feel like I saw any results from it--I felt worse, not better.) I'm also not down for spending a lot of money on supplements, sugar replacements, or expensive luxury items like coconut aminos.

Recently, life's been going less than optimally, shall we say, and I've been absolutely destroying my body with the amount of unhealthy food because I'm failing to find the energy to cook, which is less than optimal.

0,"hi! so i‘m a 20 year old girl and ever since i got into middle school i wanted to look like a stereotypical supermodel (silly, i know). 
i went to a school that focused on dance, ballet in particular, and as any of you who did ballet will know that the bullying and toxicity in that environment is brutal. 
i used to constantly get bullied and excluded for being weird and fat (even though i was never more than 5kg overweight) so because of that and some other messed up reasons i naturally developed an ed and have been struggling with that over the past eight years. 
i went vegan for ethical reasons at 16 which made me lose those 5 extra kilos and ever since then i‘ve been losing and gaining the same 3-4kg in the healthy weight range but it’s never been substantial. 

after years of therapy and learning to love myself it somehow clicked this year. i don’t look at myself in the mirror with disgust anymore, i don’t hate my body, i don’t see food as a reward or punishment anymore and exercise is something that just makes sense for some reason.
i’m now at the lowest weight i’ve ever been with my height (181cm/73kg) and i just keep on losing. i feel like it could actually be possible for me to achieve that “supermodel body” and it kinda scares me. i don’t think that i need that body type to be happy or beautiful anymore, i already am happy and beautiful. however i still want to look like that. (mainly just to see how that version of myself that i’ve dreamed of for years would actually look like ngl hahaha)

so why am i scared of that? is it the lose skin? no, it’ll just bounce back since i’m still young and i’m really not losing that much. 

is it that i’m scared i’ll become a bully myself? no, i have so much love in me and have forgiven all people who’ve wronged me in some way before so i don’t hold any anger anymore. plus i don’t think anyone should ever be bullied, especially not for their looks.

scared of losing my “safety blanket”? nope, don’t need that anymore. 
scared that i won’t be able to recognize myself? no, not that either.

i’ve thought through every single possible reason and the only conclusion i came to is that some little part of me still believes that i don’t deserve to look like i want to look. and that’s okay. today i will choose to be kind to that part, to be kind to myself because i deserve everything i’ve ever dreamed of. i am not worthless and neither are you. 

this was just me rambling for a bit and i know this post doesn’t really offer much advice but i hope that some of you can take something away from it. 

weight loss is such a hard journey and it can put you through absolute hell mentally and emotionally, no matter how much or little you want to lose. you are so incredibly strong for even just being here and i believe in you. you are amazing, incredible and beautiful. 
i truly hope you can choose to be kind to yourself for today as well, because you truly deserve it. you deserve the world!

0," 

I wanted to share the results of a long read through Google Scholar that I took. Hi [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/)!

**About me**

Like 3 years ago I went on Keto and it was awesome, helping me go down from like 215 pounds to 170. I could do like five consecutive pull-ups for the first time without much effort beyond mixing up Keto Chow shakes each evening! (I love those things.)  Co-workers commented on how great I looked! Cool.

Fast forward past a year of pretty easy maintenance, whereupon my doctor puts me on Zoloft, and I gained like twenty pounds back before ditching that for Bupropion, a much friendlier antidepressant that didn’t make me constantly ravenous. But try though I might, I had trouble getting back down to 170 with Keto-- I'm still hovering around 190.

This probably had something to do with the fact that I was living alone when I first lost the weight, and am now living with my fiancee and a number of roommates. Which makes sticking to Keto… substantially more difficult. “Hello I have prepared a delicious fruit pie”, a roommate will say, and I’ll unhinge my jaw and swallow it whole (like a python) thereby breaking ketosis. Which is a bummer.

I also have a couple of other roommates who themselves were having trouble losing weight, as was my fiancee even though she’s way more wonderful and industrious and conscientious than I am. And that inspired me to take a long, interest-fueled trip through Google Scholar, since it turns out that the efficacy of different methods of weight loss is *super* commonly-studied, and ours is a beautiful age where any internet asshole can search through unlimited carefully-indexed studies looking for incredibly specific nuggets of information. *And I am just such an asshole.*

**DISCLAIMER**

So, about me! I’m just a programmer, with no particular expertise in this or any other area. That means I am deeply unqualified to offer any kind of medical advice; my only qualification for doing anything is that I spent a bunch of time skimming online journal articles. So if you get inspired to try anything I talk about in this post, ask your doctor about it before you give it a shot or else you’ll die slowly, painfully, as your poor choices consume you from the inside out. And you will cry out ""why did you betray me, UntrustworthyBastard"" and I'll shrug and gesture at my username.

On to the studies! Let’s start out with

# Non-pharmacological weight loss methods

""Non-pharmacological weight loss methods"" are diet and exercise. This has been studied a lot, and these studies vary pretty dramatically in their results for reasons I'm not totally clear on. Probably they have a lot to do with how well the participants are made to adhere to the prescribed diet/exercise regimens.

Which is actually a core limitation of these studies! Most of these studies are intent-to-treat, which means they all include each participant in the study results *even if the participants don’t follow the diet or do anything differently.* Another way of phrasing this is that these studies measure the long-term efficacy of getting a bunch of people who want to lose weight into a room, and then telling them to go on a calorie deficit/keto diet/whatever (with accompanying pamphlets and sometimes logistical support, like buying them food), and then periodically hassling them afterward for the duration of the study.

Looked at in this light, it’s frankly impressive they were able to tease out any effect sizes at all. I would have liked a review article that broke the participants down into percentiles of weight loss-- that would give us a better idea of the range of outcomes realistically achievable-- but couldn’t find any meta-analyses that did this. Such is life.

**Diet + Exercise**

[Weight-Loss Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Weight-Loss Clinical Trials with a Minimum 1-Year Follow-Up - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002822307014836)

\&gt; *A mean weight loss of 5 to 8.5 kg (5% to 9%) was observed during the first 6 months from interventions involving a reduced-energy diet and/or weight-loss medications with weight plateaus at approximately 6 months. In studies extending to 48 months, a mean 3 to 6 kg (3% to 6%) of weight loss was maintained with none of the groups experiencing weight regain to baseline.* ***In contrast, advice-only and exercise-alone groups experienced minimal weight loss at any time point***.

[Systematic review of long-term weight loss studies in obese adults: clinical significance and applicability to clinical practice | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/0802982)

\&gt; *Dietary/lifestyle therapy provides &lt;5 kg weight loss after 2–4 y, pharmacologic therapy provides 5–10 kg weight loss after 1–2 y, and surgical therapy provides 25–75 kg weight loss after 2–4 y.*

This seems basically consistent with the previous study where over the long term diet and exercise-based interventions, for the most part, lead to 5-10 lbs of maintained weight loss.

[Very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet v. low-fat diet for long-term weight loss: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials | British Journal of Nutrition | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/verylowcarbohydrate-ketogenic-diet-v-lowfat-diet-for-longterm-weight-loss-a-metaanalysis-of-randomised-controlled-trials/6FD9F975BAFF1D46F84C8BA9CE860783)

\&gt; *\[L\]arge randomised clinical trials with long-term dietary interventions aiming weight loss showed that individuals under intensive lifestyle interventions lose about 4·8 kg( 2 , 38 ). Hence, the further reduction of 0·9 kg in the individuals assigned to a \[very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet\] would represent almost 20 % of the awaited weight loss achieved with long-term dietary interventions.*

So tl;dr: Non-calorie-restricted ketogenic diets work *marginally* better than low-fat calorie-restricted diets on average, but not by much-- Keto loses you like 12 pounds, and low-fat diets lose you like 10 pounds.

This is a larger effect size than we saw in earlier studies, which could be explainable by the study length cutoff here was 1 year whereas the earlier, more pessimistic study required like four years of followup to be included in the meta-analysis (leaving more time for weight regain).

What about exercise?

**Exercise**

[Isolated Aerobic Exercise and Weight Loss: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002934311003779)

\&gt; *Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise programs of 6-12 months induce a modest reduction in weight and waist circumference in overweight and obese populations. Our results show that isolated aerobic exercise is not an effective weight loss therapy in these patients. Isolated aerobic exercise provides modest benefits to blood pressure and lipid levels and may still be an effective weight loss therapy in conjunction with diets.*

This, you’ll notice, pretty much aligns with the [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) conventional wisdom on the topic: Exercise alone tends not to do it unless you're Michael Phelps, who my fiancée tells me eats multiple tubs of ice cream each day.

So far, so depressing-- everyone here knows that if you have the industriousness and conscientiousness to stay on a consistent calorie deficit, you’ll lose weight. It's just empirically this doesn't happen to the degree most of us would want. Though don’t forget the study limitations! Intent-to-treat is a harsh mistress, and the use of averages in these study results conceals a *lot* of individual variation in patient response to these diets.

Anyway, on to other, more exotic (but not *that* exotic) methods of weight loss!

# FDA-approved pharmacological interventions

Drugs!

This’ll be a pretty short list; the FDA has a very high bar for safety and efficacy for weight loss drugs, and as such has approved only 9 (?) drugs in this class for current usage, several of which are on-patent and thereby only affordable to the twelve riches members of the Saudi royal family. The FDA's conservative about approving these, since the history of weight loss medications includes shit like Fen-Phen (can kill you) and DNP (can make you go blind and *then* kill you; though at least this one was obvious enough that it was [banned by the FDA at around the same time the FDA got the authority to ban things](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/shilling-for-big-mitochondria).)

So the FDA makes *really fucking sure* these days that there's nothing waiting in the weeds before approving stuff for weight loss. Oftentimes this assurance comes from jamming together drugs with a long history of safe use for other conditions (see the discussion of Contrave below), which seems sensible enough.

As for whether you’d like to take drugs for weight loss, your call-- I know a lot of people on r/loseit take pride in losing weight the natural way, and more power to them. That said, the following is the opinion of the notoriously risk-averse FDA:

\&gt; [The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends pharmacotherapy for weight loss when lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise and behavioural therapy) have failed and the body mass index (BMI) is °30kg/m2 with no concomitant obesity-related risk factors, or if the BMI is °27 kg/m2 and the patient has at least one obesity-related risk factor.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

I'm aware that this does *not* align with the [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) conventional wisdom, which mostly has it that drugs are a dangerous crutch unsuitable for long-term use (and, by implication, short-term use). Which isn't always true! Lots of drugs you can basically stay on forever (such as bupropion, a popular antidepressant). The unknown risks of doing so ultimately must be weighed against the known risks inherent to obesity, which are substantial; in that way, it's a similar cost-benefit analysis as taking drugs for any other chronic condition. I myself will probably be on acid reflux medication until the day I die, and it's *super worth it*.

On that cheery note: to the drugs!

**Orlistat (Xenical)**

\&gt; [weight loss achieved was about 3% \[of total body mass\] greater for subjects taking orlistat than for those taking placebo.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

\&gt; [produces significant gastrointestinal side effects (oily faecal spotting, flatus with discharge, faecal urgency, oily stools, increased defecation, faecal incontinence, abdominal pain) in 15-30% of the patients under treatment, that tend to disappear with time if the patient adheres to a low fat diet.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

Gross.

This one’s notable because almost all of the other weight loss drugs on the market do so via the mechanism of reducing appetite; this one’s an exception, in that it instead stops your body from absorbing some of the fat you eat *whereupon it comes out the other side*.

Let’s move on.

**Phentermine+Topiramate (Qsymia)**

[Clinical utility of phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia™) combination for the treatment of obesity (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3626409/)

In this trial, about 8% of patients with placebo (diet + lifestyle counseling) lost &gt;10% of their body mass; conversely, 47% of patients in the experimental group (diet + lifestyle counseling + Qsymia) lost &gt;10% of their body mass. Note that 1% of people in the experimental group got kidney stones, so drink your water. It sounds like this is a consequence of the topiramate (at least, this appears to be a known side effect of topiramate taken alone.)

[Off-label drugs for weight management (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473499/) has a really interesting discussion of phentermine-- at the time it was approved it was under pretty serious regulatory scrutiny for its structural resemblance to meth (and thus presumed addictive potential); for this reason it was approved for short-term use only, which tends to be interpreted as up to 3 months. Post-approval studies, happily, have failed to find evidence for chemical or psychological dependence regardless of duration of use; the linked article claims:

\&gt; *There was protracted opposition to re-approval from those who maintained the sympathomimetic obesity drugs that had dangerous addiction potential. No evidence of addiction had appeared during 18 years of increasingly frequent use, but the FDA re-approved them all, having silenced the opposition by announcing the drugs would be approved for short-term use only*

\&gt; *US physicians treating obesity \[...\] continued to use phentermine and the other sympathomimetic amine anorectic drugs off-label long-term. Surveys of prescribing practices among physicians treating obesity have confirmed that a majority of these physicians continue to prescribe the sympathomimetics off-label in this manner.*

This is verified in a different study:

[Addiction potential of phentermine prescribed during long-term treatment of obesity | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo201374)

\&gt; *Phentermine abuse or psychological dependence (addiction) does not occur in patients treated with phentermine for obesity.*

And also:

[A Study of Abrupt Phentermine Cessation in Patients in a Wei... : American Journal of Therapeutics (lww.com)](https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/2011/07000/A_Study_of_Abrupt_Phentermine_Cessation_in.5.aspx)

\&gt; *Cravings for the substance abused, the hallmark characteristic of substance dependence and withdrawal, were entirely absent in the phentermine-treated subjects. Abrupt cessation of long-term phentermine therapy does not induce amphetamine-like withdrawal. Long-term phentermine therapy does not induce phentermine cravings. Symptoms observed after abrupt phentermine cessation represent loss of therapeutic effect and are not withdrawal.*

(I emphasize this part because the idea of getting addicted to something freaks me out.)

**Phentermine Alone**

[Effects of a meal replacement system alone or in combination with phentermine on weight loss and food cravings - Moldovan - 2016 - Obesity - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21649)

*&gt; The phentermine group lost 12.1% of baseline body weight compared with 8.8% in the placebo group.*

**Naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave)**

[Contrave, a bupropion and naltrexone combination therapy for the potential treatment of obesity. - Abstract - Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19777400)

\&gt; *Preliminary data demonstrated placebo-subtracted weight losses of 3 to 7% and improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary adverse effect leading to discontinuation of treatment was nausea.*

So a bit less effective than Qsymia based on phase 3 trials, but not by much; the bright side is it’s not a stimulant if you don't like stimulants. The “off-label drugs” article above claims this is sometimes combined with Phentermine but that there is no data on how often this happens or what the results are. Which is unsatisfying.

As an aside, bupropion is just Wellbutrin, an extremely common antidepressant, and naltrexone is an anti-addiction agent they use to get people off alcohol. Naltrexone’s been on the market for 15 years, and Bupropion has been on it since like the 80s. Which makes me suspect it’s quite safe, since we’ve had decades for long-term side effects to make themselves known. Food for thought. Ask your doctor.

(Speaking of long-term effects, very early on they were concerned that Contrave might hurt long-term cardiovascular health, which luckily wasn't observed in practice. Then later they thought it might actually *help* cardiovascular health instead, but [Orexigen fucked up the study](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/05/13/how_not_to_handle_your_clinical_data) so now we'll have to languish in ignorance forever, I guess?)

**Liraglutide (Saxenda)**

Apparently middling effectiveness. I’d paste some sources, but the post is getting long and this drug is like 1000 dollars a month. So maybe look into it if you *shit gold.* (I am, of course, joking-- shitting gold is a contraindication for Liraglutide and other GLP-1 inhibitors. Ask your doctor.)

I'm aware that this does *not* align with the [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) conventional wisdom, which mostly has it that drugs are a dangerous crutch unsuitable for long-term use (and, by implication, short-term use). Which isn't always true! Lots of drugs you can basically stay on forever (such as bupropion, a popular antidepressant). The unknown risks of doing so ultimately must be weighed against the known risks inherent to obesity, which are substantial; in that way, it's a similar cost-benefit analysis as taking drugs for any other chronic condition. I myself will probably be on acid reflux medication until the day I die, and it's *super worth it*.

On that cheery note: to the drugs!

**Orlistat (Xenical)**

\&gt; [weight loss achieved was about 3% \[of total body mass\] greater for subjects taking orlistat than for those taking placebo.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

\&gt; [produces significant gastrointestinal side effects (oily faecal spotting, flatus with discharge, faecal urgency, oily stools, increased defecation, faecal incontinence, abdominal pain) in 15-30% of the patients under treatment, that tend to disappear with time if the patient adheres to a low fat diet.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

Gross.

This one’s notable because almost all of the other weight loss drugs on the market do so via the mechanism of reducing appetite; this one’s an exception, in that it instead stops your body from absorbing some of the fat you eat *whereupon it comes out the other side*.

Let’s move on.

**Phentermine+Topiramate (Qsymia)**

[Clinical utility of phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia™) combination for the treatment of obesity (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3626409/)

In this trial, about 8% of patients with placebo (diet + lifestyle counseling) lost &gt;10% of their body mass; conversely, 47% of patients in the experimental group (diet + lifestyle counseling + Qsymia) lost &gt;10% of their body mass. Note that 1% of people in the experimental group got kidney stones, so drink your water. It sounds like this is a consequence of the topiramate (at least, this appears to be a known side effect of topiramate taken alone.)

[Off-label drugs for weight management (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473499/) has a really interesting discussion of phentermine-- at the time it was approved it was under pretty serious regulatory scrutiny for its structural resemblance to meth (and thus presumed addictive potential); for this reason it was approved for short-term use only, which tends to be interpreted as up to 3 months. Post-approval studies, happily, have failed to find evidence for chemical or psychological dependence regardless of duration of use; the linked article claims:

\&gt; *There was protracted opposition to re-approval from those who maintained the sympathomimetic obesity drugs that had dangerous addiction potential. No evidence of addiction had appeared during 18 years of increasingly frequent use, but the FDA re-approved them all, having silenced the opposition by announcing the drugs would be approved for short-term use only*

\&gt; *US physicians treating obesity \[...\] continued to use phentermine and the other sympathomimetic amine anorectic drugs off-label long-term. Surveys of prescribing practices among physicians treating obesity have confirmed that a majority of these physicians continue to prescribe the sympathomimetics off-label in this manner.*

This is verified in a different study:

[Addiction potential of phentermine prescribed during long-term treatment of obesity | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo201374)

\&gt; *Phentermine abuse or psychological dependence (addiction) does not occur in patients treated with phentermine for obesity.*

And also:

[A Study of Abrupt Phentermine Cessation in Patients in a Wei... : American Journal of Therapeutics (lww.com)](https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/2011/07000/A_Study_of_Abrupt_Phentermine_Cessation_in.5.aspx)

\&gt; *Cravings for the substance abused, the hallmark characteristic of substance dependence and withdrawal, were entirely absent in the phentermine-treated subjects. Abrupt cessation of long-term phentermine therapy does not induce amphetamine-like withdrawal. Long-term phentermine therapy does not induce phentermine cravings. Symptoms observed after abrupt phentermine cessation represent loss of therapeutic effect and are not withdrawal.*

(I emphasize this part because the idea of getting addicted to something freaks me out.)

**Phentermine Alone**

[Effects of a meal replacement system alone or in combination with phentermine on weight loss and food cravings - Moldovan - 2016 - Obesity - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21649)

*&gt; The phentermine group lost 12.1% of baseline body weight compared with 8.8% in the placebo group.*

**Naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave)**

[Contrave, a bupropion and naltrexone combination therapy for the potential treatment of obesity. - Abstract - Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19777400)

\&gt; *Preliminary data demonstrated placebo-subtracted weight losses of 3 to 7% and improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary adverse effect leading to discontinuation of treatment was nausea.*

So a bit less effective than Qsymia based on phase 3 trials, but not by much; the bright side is it’s not a stimulant if you don't like stimulants. The “off-label drugs” article above claims this is sometimes combined with Phentermine but that there is no data on how often this happens or what the results are. Which is unsatisfying.

As an aside, bupropion is just Wellbutrin, an extremely common antidepressant, and naltrexone is an anti-addiction agent they use to get people off alcohol. Naltrexone’s been on the market for 15 years, and Bupropion has been on it since like the 80s. Which makes me suspect it’s quite safe, since we’ve had decades for long-term side effects to make themselves known. Food for thought. Ask your doctor.

(Speaking of long-term effects, very early on they were concerned that Contrave might hurt long-term cardiovascular health, which luckily wasn't observed in practice. Then later they thought it might actually *help* cardiovascular health instead, but [Orexigen fucked up the study](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/05/13/how_not_to_handle_your_clinical_data) so now we'll have to languish in ignorance forever, I guess?)

**Liraglutide (Saxenda)**

Apparently middling effectiveness. I’d paste some sources, but the post is getting long and this drug is like 1000 dollars a month. So maybe look into it if you *shit gold.* (I am, of course, joking-- shitting gold is a contraindication for Liraglutide and other GLP-1 inhibitors. Ask your doctor.)

0,"Hey guys, my name is Jeremy, 28yrs old, 6’2 &amp; Black. Last year I decided to go on a weight journey and to an extent, I found it very successful! I wasn’t sure the approach I should take so I ended up crash dieting (1000-1200 calorie intake) from 286lbs down to the low 190s, Starting March 2 2020 and ending June 24th 2020. 

With this I ended up finally seeing my abs, and really defined muscles. Once I hit the 190s abs had a skeleton type face I went on a body recomp. For the next few months I proceeded to work on becoming a body builder and transformed my body to my idea look. I was able to walk into stores without sucking it, I got complements from everyone saying I look jacked and everything you can think of.

After a while I started bingeing on and off and it was a horrible and tedious cycle of bingeing and working out for hours to attempt to feel better about it. Abs and bicep veins started to go away, then week after they would return. This cycle would soon ruin all my progress. 

As of November of 2020 I kept my weight around 240 and still had a bodybuilder physique and thought I could return to my old self....or so I thought. I all of a sudden went on a weeks/months long binges and stopped counting my calories, stopped cardio and working out thinking of only how easy I could lose it all. 

March 1st of 2021 I went on the scale and was 280lbs, no abs and no more protruding veins..What have I done, I’m at my all time highest weight. 

I’m now back on track and currently at 270.2lbs and haven’t binged yet. This will be a rough journey but I will get thought it once again and seeing everyone on this Reddit shall give me strength.

Then, COVID and family situations happened (sister got cancer diagnosis and triggered the entire family). I stopped going to the gym a year ago, I let myself go since last September/October and my weight just kept on going up and up and up. 

While this is not the heaviest I've ever been, I don't like what I let happen to me again, since 4 years ago I was in the same predicament, and then 4 years prior, and before that I was a ""not so chubby but definitely not attractive"" teen / young adult who loved to eat my feelings away because I had nothing else to do. I've been anxious since I can remember and depressed since early teen years (maybe 12 - 13).

When I lost the most weight I managed to reach 56.5 kg ( 124.5 lb / 8.9 st) but I was insanely undereating, abusing coffee, diet coke, water and looked for pro-ana tips to not eat. So, while I did not become anorexic, I was trying really hard to count everything that went into my body to achieve my goal of finally ""not being fat"". 

Just before I got pregnant I was in the absolute best shape of my life. I was doing MMA for one hour a day, 4-5 days a week, trying to eat right and moderate my terrible sweet tooth and tendency to want to eat until I feel full; and, while I never went lower of 61 kg, I had muscles and I liked that. Granted, I never ever have had abs, but I was going to work towards that. 

Well, I am now faced with the decision of changing lifestyles. While I'm not obese (yet), being overweight is less than ideal. And since I have a child, I want to be a good example and also to be congruent with what I try to teach her to eat well and what not. Also, I want to be here a long time if possible to do my bit and then see her grow. But in the more immediate future, I'm thinking on baby #2. And given the fact that one shouldn't lose weight during pregnancy, I also worry about being healthy while pregnant. So my goal at the moment is my own health. I need to lose the weight to be able to gain it back while pregnant (so I don't gain more than necessary and not harm myself or baby with that much weight). I also shouldn't be this heavy as I've a ""broken"" disc in my back (congenital defect, was cartilage not bone and in the base of the back, so really shouldn't put on much weight if I want it to stay in place and not displace further). 

I seriously lacked motivation because I'm tired and I don't like myself, so why bother. 

But I made my resolve this week and began to take action, and for the first time in over a year (maybe more) I counted my calories to get a good deficit and exercised to further it more.

I am keeping on track today, but I may need advice or tips or some kind of support to keep going in the right direction.

0,"Hi!

I've been doing CICO pretty successfully since September. I'm 5'10"", female and 26. My starting weight was 290 and as of today I'm at 247 and super pleased with the results so far! This feels like the most sustainable weight loss attempt I've had. 

I want to start adding in some exercise in the form of cycling (I bought an upright bike in April with the thought of using it as stress relief. It's been gathering dust for... a while). My big hesitation is a silly one, and I think maybe I just need others to tell me it's silly and not a big deal, but the idea of the scale going up due to water weight brought on from exercising is really getting to me. I know it's not going to erase my progress, but I do get a little happy buzz from seeing the number trend downwards.

Edit: Thank you guys for the encouraging words! I'm still a bit worried about the potential uptick on the scale but I got off the couch and did 13.31km in 30 minutes. I feel dead but good! Now to turn this into a new habit. :)",I want to start exercising but the potential for water weight freaks me out,"I want to start exercising but the potential for water weight freaks me out Hi!

Ate pizza two days but still Counted my calories ( I usually eat 1300-1400 calories, during my periods I ate 1900-2000 ). 
That's what I want to understand. Even if I was eating 2000 calories, I should have been maintaining my weight, Right?
I walked (15000 steps except first day of my period). 
What I was doing wrong, can someone please tell me? 
I feel so heartbroken, I was 65 kilo and not overweight anymore. Now I'm 66 and one kilo over-weight. 
I had lost that one kilo in three weeks. 

I have hypothyroidism and pcos if that makes sense.

0,"This is a pretty big milestone in my journey.  I was nervous before my Doctor's appointment because I hadn't lost as much weight as I had wanted since the last check in.  

I ended up being 2lbs lighter than the last time I was there for an a1c check.  Not great, but I can't complain about weighing less.  Blood pressure was good so I was just waiting on the doc.  He comes in and doesn't sit down like usual, which I found odd.  Then he tells me my a1c dropped(I was diagnosed type 2 last Sept).  ""Good!""  is what I thought in my head.  A little drop is better than nothing.

Then he tells me it dropped from 6.9 to 6.3

And he says ""You are no longer in the diabetic range""

I didn't know how to act.  

He thinks the slowdown in weight loss is due to me starting to lift again, and wants to follow up with me in 6 months.  I started with an a1c of 7.4 last September.  

All I want to do is get off these meds, and that's a damn good update.  Hopefully if I stick with my routine and diet I can go ahead and get back to a normal life.  Feels good knowing the work I'm putting in is paying off.

Edit:  Thank you everyone.  I may be able to answer a few repeat questions better here.

My family has a history of obesity and health conditions like diabetes.  This was a nonfactor when I was active, but I went through a period in college where I was not happy.  Ate a lot of fast food and stayed indoors.  It carried through for a few years and got me here today.  I had to really dig deep and start loving myself to make the beginning of a change.

I started with cutting my fast food intake in half, and then eating ""healthy options"".  This dropped my first 20lbs.  At the time exercising was very difficult.  So this was the best I could do.  Eventually I pushed myself, and have now worked up to being able to workout 4-5 days a week.  I've also cut down my fast food consumption to about once a week now(for anyone struggling with this, it took me over a year to reach this level of discipline.  remind yourself what you should have eaten after fast food meals.  eventually you start choosing those options without thinking.  At least that's what I did.).

Believe it or not my diet has been aided by this 20 dollar crockpot I bought around christmas.  The recipes are easy, and knowing I have super tasty food at home keeps me from eating out.  I aim for 2 meals a day with snacks inbetween.  Keeps me from overeating, and if I ever feel low energy I just eat bigger meals.

Snacks consist mainly of apples and veggies(I lied mainly apples.  I need to eat more veggies).  The fiber fills me up and it's very hard to overeat on these foods.  Water helps too.  I TRY to drink a gallon a day. 

For a while I was doing an hour on the treadmill with an incline.  This worked from 295-280, then I had a stall.  My treadmill broke around the same time my friend started a home gym, so within the past month and a half I've been getting back into my college workouts(squats,bench,sqwats lol!).  I'm having fun in the gym again.  I've been focusing a lot on leg strength and jumping ability so I can play basketball for weight loss.  I managed to get a 36inch box jump off vert at 270!  That was a good moment.

So now I'm here.  Home scale says 260, which is about halfway to my goal of 205.  I know the meds will be here a while, but I want to have the option to get off them asap.  So I plan to work really hard before my next appointment.  I will have a lot of time in the summer, and normally if I have the energy I can drop weight fairly quick with enough rest.  I am trying to do this properly so I don't have a lot of loose skin, but now that I'm getting close to the turning point where every lb looks like a more drastic change, I'm ready to see it.

0,"Hey everyone,
Apologies for any mistakes, I don't frequently make posts here, but am looking for some advice.
I'm female, 27 years old 5'6 and around 137 lbs.

I am relatively in shape but just trying to lose the extra pounds I have and tone up.

I have been finding it very difficult to lose this weight although I have been tracking calories, working out intensely for an hour a day (according to my fitness watch I burn around 250-400 calories during this, although I think that is a bit of an overshot, also worth mentioning that I do not eat exercise calories back) and sometimes incorporating a walk. Because I wasn't seeing much progress I came to the conclusion that working from home, I haven't been as active as I normally would be and I cut down my calories to 1200 a day.

This is where I am stuck. I began seeing faster progress but I felt awful, insomnia, irritable and tired and a preoccupation with food. I have now had to take a few days off exercise to feel normal again. I've realised that this figure was perhaps too low so I've decided to bump up to 1400 calories.

My question is, do you think this would be enough of a deficit to lose weight?

I appreciate that everyone's body is different and reacts in different ways, but any advice is appreciated all the same.

I have been told the calories do not matter in the protein powder and that weight gain will happen no matter what.

I have been told that protein powder will cause weight gain even if you are eating at a significant deficit and exercising considerably: that as long as protein powder is being consumed, weight loss will not be realistic. 

I have been told the calories do not matter in the protein powder and that weight gain will happen no matter what.

My question is will the cravings/binge eating ever go away?

Long story short I am 24 years old and my highest weight was 418lbs and now I am down to 198lbs. I am very proud of myself and what I have accomplished. But I am typing this out and feeling very depressed as I have pretty much eaten a pint of ice cream and other snacks tonight. I am staying this weekend at my parents house where there is loads of unhealthy food and I am just not disciplined to say no to certain foods no matter how full I am. I really thought that now I am much healthier that I would’ve changed and been disciplined enough to say no. I pride myself in being a very disciplined person as I don’t drink, can abstain from porn/self pleasure, only smoke on occasion with friends, but cannot say no to Food.

0,"Backstory: I grew up in an abusive household with almost no access to food. Binge eating kept me alive. When I moved out at 18 I was so poorly acclimated to stable food that I gained 100lbs in less than six months before I realized what I had done to my body.  

A few years ago I lost about 60lbs through calorie counting, getting treatment for my asthma, and consequently finally being able to exercise! 
But then financial tragedy hit, I lost access to my gym and asthma medicine, I was stressed and food insecure, which triggered my binge eating and I gained a lot of weight back. Got it under control, lost 20 or so pounds, sat there for a while since I was still struggling financially and stressed.    

Then covid hit too. Spouse and I lost our jobs. We were eating rice and beans we got from charitable neighbors for two months- we were ineligible for a lot of aid since we got most of our income from self employment. Cue more food insecurity and when we did start getting paid again it was inconsistent so I was binging, starving, binging again. I gained more weight and now I'm the biggest I've ever been. 

We are financially stable again. I have a job and insurance and I'm about to get back on my asthma treatments for the first time in a few years.  I want to seek therapy for my disordered eating but I'm worried that since it only happens in bursts as a result of triggers which will hopefully not be present anymore, that therapy will help me out for now, I'll get comfortable and lower my guard, and I'll get triggered again years down the line and ruin all my progress once more.

It all started when I was little. In high school I weighed 300lbs. At 16 I dropped the weight down to 198lbs. I’m currently about 220lbs and muscular. So, I haven’t really regained fat, but I’d still like to tighten up more and the binge eating every night does halt progress.

I eat normally through the day and then I’ll go to bed and wake up after an hour or two and just go all out on oatmeal, protein powder, or whatever is around. I don’t keep non-nutrient dense food in the house, but still, excess calories are excess calories. 

This cycle has been ongoing for what seems like years. I just want to break it already. Any tips and help would be appreciated. There’s really no trigger. I could be having a great day or a horrible day and the outcome would be the same. 

I’ve tried eating lighter through the day and then a big meal before bed and I’m not sure I’ve noticed a difference. That’s what I’m trying tonight again. 

Food choices through the day are always filling. Protein heavy. Fruits and veggies. I drink over a gallon of water a day too.

I plan to start my acting career in 2021. So I need to step up my weight loss journey by a LOT. I’ve been doing everything that I can. Granted, My eating habits still aren’t the best. I’m working on it. I need to stick to 1,500 calories, Anything less I felt too faint for my weight or anything above that will make me gain more as I’m training. So it’s a good start for me. Eventually as I lose more I’d like to lower it to 1,200 when I get closer to 210 lbs. Now I almost gave up my acting career over the weekend before I even started it. I’ve been in one play recently with a lead role and I loved it. I still want to go for it since it’s something I really want to do!! 

Anyway back to my weight. Like I said I haven’t been eating the best, I had a cheat weekend which I haven’t done in a long time, I just gave into a few small cravings and didn’t over indulge like I used to do. I was careful and actually lost 3 lbs this weekend! I was shocked. I have been trying to drink more water, Haven’t really been counting but it’s at least 100+ Oz. The serving is 42 when I fill up my water filter half way, And I drink at least 3 a day. I won’t be having another cheat day for a while, Because it made me feel like crap. It literally made me sick and I still don’t feel well from yesterday. 

I need to lose exactly 12 lbs a month to lose 70 lbs before this year has ended. I will have an extra month in December, I hope I won’t get too off track by then. I’ve hit a pause for the last two weeks. But once I get back into meal prepping I should be fine right? I usually lose about 3 lbs a week when I do this, Which is too fast for most but it’s what I need! I was never in such a rush before, But I want to look my best so I can start sending out those acting auditions. I don’t think I’m in an obsessive state yet, And I am being careful. I don’t workout for long hours, In fact I mostly only have 30 minutes at the gym since my ride is always late but I am going to start getting there early and workout for a full hour again! My arms are already tightening/getting smaller, That’s always the hardest part but it was small when I was training before so maybe that’s why it only took 3 weeks this time around. My chest is still huge but not as bad as it was- I can tell by my size, it doesn’t fit anymore. I’ve noticed that I lost most of the fat in my back, Which was quite hard to get rid of as well. So it’s mostly upper body that I need to work on, My lower body is pretty good right now but I will be keeping up with both. I think HIIT will help with that.

My chest is still huge but not as bad as it was- I can tell by my size, it doesn’t fit anymore. I’ve noticed that I lost most of the fat in my back, Which was quite hard to get rid of as well. So it’s mostly upper body that I need to work on, My lower body is pretty good right now but I will be keeping up with both. I think HIIT will help with that. 

Anyway, Is this possible to lose 70 lbs before the year is over? Have you done it or lost even more in 9 months?"
0,"Hello everyone. I hope you've had a good week.

I started trying to lose weight in October last year and from October 1st to like mid December I lost 7 kg (about 15 pounds). But ever since then I started to lose focus and started bad eating habits again. At first I just plateaued, but ever since mid January, maybe it was coincidence, maybe causation, when I started studying for my exams, I let myself go big time and gained back about 3 kg (6.6 pounds). Now that my exams are over, I am having a hard time getting my eating habits back on track.

At least I still do home workouts with a friend (just digitally, of course) 3 times a week and if the weather and Covid regulations allow it, I will be able to go horseback riding again every other week, so I have the exercise part covered.

I wanted to make a post to make myself more accountable and comment to update on my weekly progress. I hope this will also give me back some of my motivation to eat healthier.

Well, as of today, March 7 2021, I weight 74 kg (163 pounds). My goal is to lose between 500 g to 1 kg per week (1 to 2 pounds) and my goal weight is 60 kg (132 pounds).

See you next week if you like to.

Recently, after falling off the weight loss wagon, I curiously took a look at my weight on the scale and was surprised to see that the changes I made in activity (walking 45-50 minutes to work and back home everyday and in the past week biking the distance,) helped me lose weight! I remember being 190 pounds at one point, and the other day it was 176. I didn't even notice the difference, maybe it was due to me drinking less soda too? But I talked more seriously about getting a planet fitness membership and ""drinking just water"" with my significant other (not totally dieting) and she responded to me with this.

Weight is a huge negative trigger for me :,) seeing someone your size (literally my dream body) say ""omg im so obese lol i need to lose soooo much weight"" when im literally stuck at 260+ pounds because of my depression makes me lowkey want to die 😎))

She hasn't told me to NOT lose weight and doesn't discourage me from it, but she has discouraged me from relying on the BMI scale to define whether I'm obese (it was 31 or 32 when I was 190.) And that I don't need to lose weight I look fine. But I want to become healthier and an average weight for my height. (21F 5 feet 5 inches) I want to do whatever kind of activity I want and not get tired so quickly.

I knew that eating healthier and exercise would give me some benefits immediately, but I did not expect to notice them so quickly!

We started focusing on CICO and eating more fruits/veggies with at least every meal. I’ve also been adding more walks and some at home exercises such as  push-ups, sit ups, and some YouTube workout videos. 

Within two weeks, I have already lost five pounds which I was pleased with. We decided to do a non-food treat that should encourage us to keep going.

First Post for me, I've been a massive lurker here! Trying to see what might work for me and see other people's experiences.

I'm Male(25), 5ft 4 (wasn't blessed with a tall gene!) and now come in at 202lbs.
Looking at healthy weight calculators; I should be coming in at around 145lbs. Now I haven't been that weight for nearly 7 years; it's crept on incredibly slowly. Being in a relationship has been great, but as we're extremely comfortable together; it was more about enjoyment then taking care of ourselves.

I've managed to lose about 2 stone before but I just get so bored! Eating salad really really bores me. I didn't have healthy food practices instilled in me when growing up; so I struggle. So it piles back on. Lockdown hasn't helped either due to motivation; and I haven't been able to exercise well for about 5 years as I had undiagnosed compartment syndrome in both legs (managed to get them operated in December last year) and I'm now able to walk without intense pain.

I really want to stay motivated; but do struggle. I'm fine managing my breakfasts and lunch; I have no control over dinner apart from portion sizing and not having takeaways due to living with family (not a good cook, not an excuse though).

Just thought I'd post a bit about me, and visit here for motivation. I really struggle with having an off day, and just fall off the wagon.

0,"I've been fat all my life. I'm 57. 

I never took losing weight seriously until I was married and had a daughter on the way, weighing in excess of 350 pounds. I began low-carb dieting in 2003, and went from my all time high of 364 to 270 or so...then stuck there for years. I dabbled sometimes, getting as low as 240, but probably still spent a decade doing that bounce-around. I never got above 280 again, but I got close, and then I'd lose a bit here and again. I'm 5'10"" tall.

Since I'd experienced life at 350+, I was *kind* of satisfied. There is a huge functional difference with 100 pounds gone. You feel it in everything you do. 

During the pandemic, I decided I wanted more. I stuck more seriously to carb restriction and added a 16-hour fast, which was both surprisingly easy and amazingly effective. I am now at 214 pounds and losing 3-4 pounds a month. My fasts sometimes go 20 hours -- and I hardly notice. 

I also gave up the gym due to Covid and instead of strength training, I added on running. I've probably lost at least some muscle in the transition, but my belly and face are much smaller now.

Anyway, I realized something the other day. Was at dinner with some work colleagues who I've worked with for years.  Never considered either of them overweight, and they asked about it. I was the lightest guy at the table by a good 15 pounds. Among my friends, I'm lighter than most all of them. Two of my three brothers are heavier than me, and the other isn't much lighter. I realize that I'm not remarkably overweight these days. 

It's kind of an eye-opening moment when you consider how used to being the fat guy, the big guy, the roundest guy around -- and suddenly you *aren't*. Being a forever-fat guy, I realized that my whole identify was wrapped up in it. It was my most distinguishing characteristic. It's a good feeling, and I'm certainly not done losing weight now, but it's almost disconcerting. 

I guess I'm saying it feels a little like an adventure to me. At my age, there isn't that much new in the world, with kids, life and career occupying most of your attention and time. I'm definitely the same person I always was, but in some ways, I've been divorced from a core (and toxic) part of my self-image.",No longer the biggest guy at the table,"No longer the biggest guy at the table I've been fat all my life.

0,"Hi there! So I am new to this subreddit and I just wanted to share how my weight loss journey started and how things are going.

In May of 2020, I (24F, 5'6"") was diagnosed with a metabolic/hormonal condition called PCOS. I was at a fairly normal weight for my height back in high school, but it progressively got worse throughout college. I figured it was just due to the stress and lack of sleep, but after getting my diagnosis it made a lot more sense since weight gain is one of the main symptoms of the condition. Throughout most of my time in college, I was roughly 238 lbs and would fluctuate +/-2 lbs. I tried to work out when I could in between my classes and job, but nothing was really working. When I got my diagnosis last year that's when I realized I really needed to do something about it, especially since my condition puts me at risk for type 2 diabetes (which I already had a risk of genetically since my mom has it).

Anyways, over the past year since the diagnosis, I started to make small changes in my eating habits such as switching from my refined carb intake to whole grains, reducing my sugar intake, eating more protein and healthy fats, etc. I also started to walk every day and swim a couple of times a week. When I followed up with my doctor in October, I had dropped down to 231. It honestly didn't feel like much, but my doctor commended me for it. I then started working a job that requires a lot of walking and lifting (I work in a special ed classroom as an assistant, it definitely keeps me active). I kept up with what I was doing but slacked during December because our classroom had to quarantine and the pool I swam at closed.

I got back on it in February and joined a gym thanks to a discount, and got two free sessions with a personal trainer (I can't afford to buy a program unfortunately), but in the first session, he showed me some resistance exercises I can do in addition to my swimming and other cardio. The first one focused on upper body exercises, the second one when I have it will focus on lower body and abs. I will get to keep meeting with the trainer monthly but just as a check-in about my goals since I'm not doing a program. I've also started going to a yoga class once a week and am really enjoying it as well.

As for my progress, I just weighed myself at the gym yesterday and I dropped down to 224.6 lbs! I was so happy, I've officially lost about 14 lbs since my diagnosis and I'm going to keep working hard at it so I can get my BMI below 30! And this also feels amazing because a shirt that used to be a bit snug on me, fits better now than it used to! So I know that it's working and I just wanted to share with you all. PCOS is known to make it difficult for women who have it to lose weight and the solutions for dealing with the symptoms associated with are also variable, I'm glad that I've finally found something that is working! :D So even if you are struggling and/or have a condition like this, there is hope, don't give up!",Finally starting to see progress!,"Finally starting to see progress!

Around June 2020 I had a few serious personal issues crop up on a couple fronts and stopped taking care of myself. I do have a therapist and am in a better mental place now but I haven't stopped my terrible dietary habits. I've gained 50 pounds over the past ~7 months, I have stretch marks now, I get out of breath walking up 2 flights of stairs. I hate myself but I can't seem to make myself stop ordering food.

I don't seem to enjoy any part of the process. As soon as I get the compulsion to order food, the dread sets in. Once I order it (and I always do), I feel immediate shame and disgust. It arrives and I eat all of it even though it makes me sick and cry, then I go to sleep hating myself. 

My therapist is aware of the issue but no one in my life knows the extent of it. I spent over $1000 on takeout last month alone.

0,"I've been following this page for the last little while in hopes that it will motivate me to finally fight for my happiness. This post is a bit all over the place, so I apologise in advance!

I'm not obese or that overweight by any means, and I know that my current weight is a lot of people's goal weight. 

I've dealt with anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and everything in between. 3 years ago I moved to NZ to be with my boyfriend, and it's been a journey (in terms of my health). 

I joined a diet centre when I was 18 because some guy stopped talking to me because he thought I was fat. I had always been the big girl in class since I was a kid, so this hurt me. 

Worst. Decision. Of. My. Life. This honestly ruined me. I know that so many people have found success with CICO, and I wish I could because it seems to work really well for so many people. But this lead to so many obsessive behaviours that I'm still trying to shake to this day (I'm 29 now). 

I moved to Vancouver when I was 20 to attend university, while in a long distance relationship with a guy back home (Montreal). I got depressed, dropped out of uni, gained all the weight that I had lost when I was 18, and then some. I think the highest I ever weighed was about 200lbs. I'm 5'6"" and carry it all in my mid section. So I wasn't feeling too great about myself, as you can imagine. Managed to lose some of it, I think I got down to 170lbs through yoga and running.

When I was 22 I moved to Australia and for some reason just stopped caring about calories, was drinking heaps, but I was super active (going to the gym 5x a week with one of our flatmates and snowboarding almost every day). The weight seemed to melt off. I think I got down to 160lbs, but I still thought I was fat. Although I remember this time fondly because I ate food and enjoyed it.

A few years later, Australian boyfriend and I broke up, and I moved back to Canada. Stopped drinking, joined a gym, was cycling everywhere, rock-climbing, hiking, snowboarding and everything in between. Fittest I had ever looked and felt in my life. I think I got down to 145lbs (but it still wasn't enough). 

Wasn't really sure what I was doing with my life, jumped between cities, gained weight, lost weight. 

Finally ended up moving to NZ 3 years ago to be with my partner (whom I met in Australia). Weight's gone up and down but has consistently been around 175lbs. Fitness is non existent at the moment (my partner has a broken spine from snowboarding so the activities we can do together that don't cause him more pain are limited). Started eating everything and anything, but I have stopped counting calories. I've been enjoying a lot of foods, but I still don't feel great in my skin. I look at pictures of myself and I don't like what I see. 

I've tried doing Whole30 on and off (and I'm currently doing one now - on day 22). I downloaded MFP the other night just for fun, I thought I might be in the right headspace to use it effectively after all these years. Nope. Binged on RxBars and everything else tonight. 

And so I have realised that I am still not where I need to be with my relationship with myself, and food. I've come a hell of a long way, but there's still work to be done. 

I want to do it right for me. Right for my boyfriend. I am so tired of letting food control me and this idea that I have to ""work out"" when all I want is to enjoy food, enjoy activities, and enjoy life. I'm currently at 163 lbs and my goal is 145-150lbs. This is where I feel good. Not perfect, but really good. I've never had a six-pack and I don't think I ever will. And that's okay! I don't need one, but I do want to feel comfortable and capable.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you've made it this far. This post ended up being a lot longer than I thought. Tomorrow is a new day!","Long time lurker, first time poster.","Long time lurker, first time poster. I've been following this page for the last little while in hopes that it will motivate me to finally fight for my happiness. This post is a bit all over the place, so I apologise in advance!

I'm not obese or that overweight by any means, and I know that my current weight is a lot of people's goal weight. 

I've dealt with anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and everything in between. 3 years ago I moved to NZ to be with my boyfriend, and it's been a journey (in terms of my health). 

I joined a diet centre when I was 18 because some guy stopped talking to me because he thought I was fat. I had always been the big girl in class since I was a kid, so this hurt me. 

Worst. Decision. Of. My. Life. This honestly ruined me. I know that so many people have found success with CICO, and I wish I could because it seems to work really well for so many people. But this lead to so many obsessive behaviours that I'm still trying to shake to this day (I'm 29 now). 

I moved to Vancouver when I was 20 to attend university, while in a long distance relationship with a guy back home (Montreal). I got depressed, dropped out of uni, gained all the weight that I had lost when I was 18, and then some. I think the highest I ever weighed was about 200lbs. I'm 5'6"" and carry it all in my mid section. So I wasn't feeling too great about myself, as you can imagine. Managed to lose some of it, I think I got down to 170lbs through yoga and running.

When I was 22 I moved to Australia and for some reason just stopped caring about calories, was drinking heaps, but I was super active (going to the gym 5x a week with one of our flatmates and snowboarding almost every day). The weight seemed to melt off. I think I got down to 160lbs, but I still thought I was fat. Although I remember this time fondly because I ate food and enjoyed it.

A few years later, Australian boyfriend and I broke up, and I moved back to Canada. Stopped drinking, joined a gym, was cycling everywhere, rock-climbing, hiking, snowboarding and everything in between. Fittest I had ever looked and felt in my life. I think I got down to 145lbs (but it still wasn't enough).

0,"A lot of people recommend sedentary no matter what your life style is and often recommend 1,200 calories for women despite their lifestyle. 

My sedentary would have me at 1,400 to lose 1 pound a week. Well I really thought that was wrong and that my actual tdee was closer to 2300 so I could eat 1700 and lose a pound per week. A lot of people suggested to me that I eat 1200 and it wasn’t possible my tdee was that high. 

Well I’ve been eating 1700 for 4 weeks now and have been losing 2 pounds a week (so from 180 to 172) at a very steady rate. I went to the doctor a few days ago and he took measurements and ran some tests to find out my fat/muscle composition and asked a lot of questions about my activity levels and determined my tdee was definitely between 2500-2800. 

He recommended I stay above 1500 since I’m apparently pretty active and he thinks I need the extra calories. I waitress and have a second job as an artist (doing murals or teaching) so I’m on my feet for 8+ hours a day and run for a mile or 2 run in the morning and life weights and stuff) 

In other words if you really feel your tdee is higher than sedentary they just try it higher for a few weeks. Give it 3 weeks at 1500 or 1700 or even 2000 and see if you notice any changes. There is no rush in weight loss. I actually only wanted to lose 1 pound a week because I only have 30 (22 now) to lose so I was just gonna get it done in 30 weeks. 

If you notice changes then just stay at that higher calorie until you stop seeing changes. If you don’t see changes then you can lower it. It’s all trial and error. You don’t have to eat 1200 a day being an active person and feeling like crap because you’re burning so much. Do what’s best for you and don’t believe everyone who preaches always choosing sedentary despite your activity level.

0,"TL;DR: I (25F) was always naturally skinny and now that I’ve gained weight I realize I know nothing about how food actually works or what it takes to eat healthy. Looking for tips, advice, or just stories to relate to. 

I guess I can start with some background here. Growing up my family was kinda poor. We survived, but food was always cheap and a “eat what you get” ideology. I was also always naturally skinny. To the point where family asked me if I was anorexic even though I was constantly eating. This persisted through most of college. I would just eat what ever and my metabolism was so high it didn’t matter. 

A couple of years ago I was hanging out with a work friend (pre-pandemic) and we were looking through old photos, and she made a comment about how I used to be SO skinny in high school (but not like in mean way). It kinda jarred me though. And now (post-pandemic) I weigh even more than I did when that comment was made. 

I’m not super overweight by any means, but I’m also not the super skinny person I was used to being. I want to try and lose like 20 lbs. I can see the weight gain now and my self-esteem is shot. My face is fatter, I have a beer gut, and I have stretch marks all over my thighs and hips. I really want to get back into shape but I don’t know where to start. 

I don’t have a job right now, so I can’t really buy a lot of the foods I want. But it’s finally not -10F outside so I’m going to start walking/jogging again. Other than that I don’t really know where to start. 

I’ve looked a little bit into fasting (Intermittent and OMAD). But I realized that I basically already do that. I just don’t understand how to actually plan my meals and count calories and things like that. Like, I don’t think its healthy OMAD to just eat a big bowl of spaghetti for dinner lol. Being poor has left me with some really bad habits. Because a bowl of pasta or a couple potatoes is better than not eating I guess. 

I’ve slowly been getting more and more into cooking. And not the “just buy everything pre-made and warm it up” kind of cooking, but actually making stuff from scratch. I don’t really follow recipes except for baking. But without recipes I don’t really know anything about what I’m making. Sure I can cook a piece of salmon with some veggies and potatoes, but I have no idea how portions work, or what kinda nutrients are in the food, or how many calories I’m eating, etc. 

Where do I even begin in trying to learn about diets and nutrition? How do you make nutritious food? How do you know what you need? How do you make serving sizes when you cook for yourself? How do you track your calorie intake and outtake? What actually does it take to eat and live healthier? Do you just google everything you put into your recipes? Because that sounds super tedious and I doubt I could keep the motivation to do that. I’ve also been curious about meal-prep but I don’t know anything about that either. 

Thanks for reading my novel. If anyone has advice or stories to share about their journey I would very much appreciate it. Oh and I’m also a pescatarian so my protein needs to come from fish and vegetarian sources if anyone has tips on that too.",Where do I start?

It seems straightforward enough... no calorie counting, but they give you a meal plan. Complex carbs are restricted to 3 portions per day and one meal with none. There’s a group chat element and the opportunity to chat with a nutritionist.

It’s fairly expensive (think it works out as about £110 for the whole thing) but it is apparently used by the NHS and has some good reviews. One benefit to me is the structure, because I’m struggling to get started at the moment.

So my main theory is because I have lost fat over my stomach/abdomen the sounds are just louder due to there not being insulating fat covering the area. Maybe?

0,"This is my first time posting so bear with me on this. I'm a 24 FtM trans man who has been on T for two years but has seen little weight loss b/c of it, only fat redistribution. A few months back I started up a new diet and began keeping track of my steps and my heart rate as well as calories. I fell off the wagon a few weeks ago but even before then I found myself hitting a wall. I came down from 210 to 185 but couldn't get any lower than that. Considering I'm only 5'1, clearly I can do better. 

I think the biggest issue is my calorie count. I was sticking to a general 2,300 but found after a while that on busy days I could only eat 3 meals instead of the 4 I normally need, whereas it was almost too many calories on not busy days. 

For me, busy days means working a shift at both of my jobs. I wake up at 6am and clock in to the first at 7am, then switch at 1pm to the other job where I stay till after 9pm. I'm on my feet nearly the entire day, moving, sweating, and staying active (my step counter is usually between 15 and 20k on these days). I typically have a pre-prepared light breakfast like a protein shake or some eggs, a heavier lunch at the first job, then dinner at the second, and finally another light meal once I get home. The 2300 calorie count severely restricted what I could eat during these days, so I'd often skip one of the meals or eat something tiny, which often  resulted in me feeling sick from hunger for hours. (Ever since I started T, being too hungry gives me awful acid reflux so I try to avoid it when I can) 

Conversely, on days when I'm off, I still feel like I need to eat a ton but am not actually hungry enough to get the whole 2300 calories down. I'd often just snack lightly throughout the day, have dinner, and end up somewhere around 1800 calories. 

Im not really sure where I can make a change to help me get over this 185 hump. Do I adjust my calories on days when I work doubles to allow for a 4th meal, then trim down on days off, or should I only aim for 3 meals and deal with the acid reflux? Is it okay to stagger my calorie counts daily or should I be aiming for something more steady? 

Any advice is appreciated.","I need to set myself a calorie count, but my activity level varies wildly from day to day","I need to set myself a calorie count, but my activity level varies wildly from day to day This is my first time posting so bear with me on this.

Im not really sure where I can make a change to help me get over this 185 hump. Do I adjust my calories on days when I work doubles to allow for a 4th meal, then trim down on days off, or should I only aim for 3 meals and deal with the acid reflux? Is it okay to stagger my calorie counts daily or should I be aiming for something more steady? 

Any advice is appreciated."

Last year, before I started drinking, I only weighed about 102~106 lbs since I fluctuated between that a lot. However, during quarantine I started drinking hard kombucha almost everyday and eating quite a bit more than usual, probably around 1600-1800 calories. I’m now about 125 lbs and wish to go back to my normal weight so I cut the drinking cold turkey, I’ve been clean for about a month if not more, how long does it take for metabolism to go back to normal? Plus how to I curb my appetite a bit more? For some reason I’m always hungry now and I don’t know why... I was never like this before. I am eating about 1200-1400 calories a day now if I remember to track it and doing some light exercise on the side since I’m a bit busy with work and school. Any tips in regards to curbing appetite and the metabolism after drinking?

0,"this winter i've hardly gone anywhere or done anything and it's pretty shocking how little i move.  i've been focusing the last two years or so on my diet, basically learning to cook, eat real foods and managing grocery bills, but haven't made any real effort to get more active.  i mean, consistently active, not just going for a bike ride on a nice summer day and then doing nothing.  also, yoga's great and everything but it isn't really cutting it.  this winter, my lack of movement has been so bad, my bowels are feeling it and i've been constipated on and off for months.  just walking hasn't been enough to work that out.  even if i walk an hour or so, i'm still sitting around the rest of the day.

in an effort to move more, i decided to try one of those aerobics workout videos.  i've wanted to try them for a while now but i've always felt kind of self-conscious (in my own home even) about the idea.  timing my first try for when i knew i'd be home alone, i gave one a shot.  two things immediately struck me: 1) i am slow AF 2) i'm so sedentary it feels weird to move.  just throwing a punch was like the most alien move.  so many movements were just awkward and unsteady.  and they move fast, i never realized my pace was so slow! 

the exercises may look easy and most of them are, but doing them at a really fast pace is sort of the key.  let me tell you, i felt it the next day, but pushed through it again.  my body adjusted quick and it's also pretty great just to move with more strength and balance, which brings me to the third thing that struck me: this is great!  i've always hated aerobic exercise because it's mostly high impact.  running, jogging, jumping rope, great exercise but all killers on your joints.  i've been heavy my whole life, so that's always been a problem for me.  also, these workouts are exactly the right pace.  they do me in every time, but i can still do them daily.  

finally, glad to say i'll be getting back to work and starting a new, physical and pretty fast-paced job next week.  it'll be killer to be on my feet all day again, and i know it's going to be a really rough first week or so but i need it!

these are the aerobics workouts i've been doing and i highly recommend them!  it's a great youtube channel all 'round and there are tons of other routines besides these couple i'll suggest.

0,"Ok so basically what I mean to say is, for those who have been “on a diet” for most of their teen/adult lives but never seemed to fall through in the long run, what is it about this time that you’re certain is going to be successful? Whether you’re currently losing weight or have already accomplished your goals, was there, or has there ever been, a moment where it all sort of just clicked and you finally realized that success was in your grasp?

I’m asking because I’m the yo-yo girl. I’ve struggled with EDs from the age of 10, I am a frequent dieter in my adult life, and I have a history of crash landing into months-long periods of binge eating. In January of 2019 I finally admitted I had a problem and I decided to seek out therapy for my tumultuous relationship with food. In the last 2 years I have lost 30lbs which is a drop in the ocean compared to what I want to lose but I feel those 30lbs have taught me valuable lessons. 

This January I took those lessons and decided to get serious about weight loss and I’m down 11lbs in 2 months, which is great! Everyday is less an exercise in restraint and more of a practice in forgiveness. I no longer punish myself for eating a burger every once in a while. The difference is that because I no longer see burgers as “evil” I can now stop at eating 1 of them and I move on to the next meal with no guilt attached. My guilt used to fuel my binge eating and now it’s gone. I’m also able to calorie count for the first time in my life without triggering the ED I had as a child/teen. 

This switch in my mentality towards food and my body has led me to believe that this is “it”. This is finally the moment I’ve been yearning for my whole life. I feel like I’m finally going to succeed at the one thing I’ve failed time and time again. But that’s the thing, I’ve failed countless times and my confidence cripples when I remember all the times I’ve gassed myself up in the past to only fall on my face a few weeks later. 

So yeah! Basically just wondering how many here just “knew” and how true did you believe that to be/did it prove to be true in the end? What conditions led you to decide this? I’m still relatively early on in my own course and I am just curious if this feeling is universal or not and does it mean anything substantial. Because I really feel like this time is different.",Has there ever been a point along your journey (especially early on) where you just sort of knew that THIS was the time you would finally succeed?

0,"So I’ll start off by saying I’ve gained a significant amount of weight in the last 4/5 years. I’ve been skinny my whole life. Partially bc of genetics, also bc of my athletic lifestyle up until about 18. My depression, laziness and puberty led me to weight gain. I basically messed up my metabolism. I’d consider myself fat for sure at this point and it’s really depressing. I have some stretch marks on my stomach now, my thighs &amp; my shoulder neck &amp; chin area are noticeably bigger.

I’ve lost some weight recently due to eating better and moving around again. I joined the gym today actually. Growing up, I was skinny from the front &amp; the sideview. My waist was naturally small especially from the side view, &amp; it used to go inward too (hourglass).  

But now.... I’m bigger from the side! Even with losing a few pounds I’ve noticed I look smaller looking straight on but when I turn to the side my torso is like 2 times the size it used to be! I cried over it lol what can I do to make it smaller?? I’m in a calorie deficit &amp; I’m trying to stay consistent w working out. But anything extra? And is there anything I can do to get my hourglass figure back? like that indent? 

Also, is it possible to make my arms shoulders!!! &amp; the back of my neck small &amp; skinny again? They’re like huge now.
 It’s embarrassing. Not to say it’s bad on everyone but It just doesn’t fit my frame. Do I just need to lose fat or am I screwed? And can I get my chin to be smaller? Get my legs skinny again?

And what can I do about the stretch marks on my belly? Will they go away with weight loss or get worse? 

Lots of questions, I know. but any information is deeply appreciated!!

0,"I’ve been working out for quite a few years, and cut down for summer seasons about 3 or 4 years in a row now. I’ve always done the basic method of multiplying BW by 15 to get maintenance calories then subtracting 500 for my deficit numbers, but now I’m wondering if the BMR/TDEE method is more accurate and I’ve been cutting too much??

For example, my current BW is 165lbs. Using the simple method with moderate activity levels gets me a 2,475 caloric maintenance with a 1,975 caloric deficit. Whereas using the TDEE  method gives me a BMR @ 1,700 (I’m a 24year old male 5’7”) and using the moderate numbers 1700x1.55 gives me a TDEE of 2,635. Thus making my caloric deficit 2,371.5 if I multiply by 0.9.

That’s almost a 400 calorie difference so my question is, does that gap matter and if so, what number would be the best to cut from? Or am I calculating this incorrectly?

0,"I (27 year old male) started weight loss a couple years ago at 220 lbs, 5’11. I acordioned a few times until my most recent attempt starting at 195. I’m down to 175 on my way to 155, and I want to speak to those experiencing plateaus.

Plateaus are that tedious, disheartening phase when the scale will not budge. You’re keeping to the calorie count and everything! Why won’t it go down? This question is what I want to answer.

When you keep a calorie deficit, your body is burning fat or muscle. It has to. So why won’t the weight go down? Because your body is also holding on to a bunch of water. What happened with me was almost like clock work. I would keep a deficit, the scale stayed put, until one day I had to pee like CRAZY. Your plateau could just be your body getting ready to piss out LITERAL POUNDS OF WATER. I know it sucks to not see the scale number moving, but know that your fat is being burned if you’re keeping a deficit! That water is gonna come off soon, since there’s less fat to hold it in! The scale number is gonna move in time!

As a minor post-script, this anecdote assumes you are like me and barely workout. Muscles can change the entire weight calculus. But again, whatever the scale says, if the calorie balance is in a deficit, your body is burning at least some fat!",My experience with weight loss and plateaus,"My experience with weight loss and plateaus I (27 year old male) started weight loss a couple years ago at 220 lbs, 5’11.

0,"Just wanted to share some success. Like many, I put on a lot of weight in the last year. But I was also fat before that, due to binge drinking in college. I put on probably 40lbs in college, and another 30 last year. 

So I finally got my shit together. I got a stationary bike a few months ago and used it intermittently for a while. In mid-Jan I started to get serious with it. My GF got a scale about a month ago and I clocked in at 270lbs (I'm 6'2, so I look big, but not huge). That was a reality check for me. Since then, I cut the drinking way down. I could still do some more work on the drinking, but I'm comfortable with where I'm at. We have also started eating a lot healthier, and less food. We went from a full meal of take out multiple times a week to cooking healthy meals and eating decent portions. I also adjusted my breakfast and lunch intake, usually a yogurt, apple, and protein bar for breakfast and then a portion of leftovers or a turkey sandwich and some carrots with hummus or the like. 

For the bike, I aim for at least 40 mins every day except Fri/Sat. I turn on a show and go. When I started out I barely had the stamina to stand while biking for 1 min. Thursday, I hit 25 minutes of straight standing while biking. I try to keep my heart rate above 140 bpm. 

I'm down to almost exactly 260lbs as of this morning. I reckon I was somewhere around 275 before we got the scale but I won't count it. My face is starting to look thinner. Goal weight is about 210lbs which will put me to my sophomore year of college weight. I was at 185lbs at one point, but looking back, I felt like I was too skinny. I don't like how I looked haha.

0,"I just finished day one. I have gained 60lbs since the pandemic began. I was in pretty good shape at 6’3 210 going to the gym every day. Life has changed a lot since but also not. 

My DNA results told me I’d benefit from a low fat diet. I’ve never paid too much attention to fat, only protein and carbs! I got right in the recommended range today. My appetite felt good, I drank a ton of water and tracked it. I recorded all of my food. I got 1700 calories with 30 minutes of walking. I don’t feel starved or filled with cravings much at all. This is a good feeling.

I really want to get into the 100s and even a BMI of 21. I think that’d be really neat. 

I am almost impressed by how big I have gotten. It’s over now, though. My waist was measured at 49”! Normally it’s about 35”! My goal is 30”. 😌

Foods I am eating:

Egg whites

35 whole wheat bread

Chicken (battered in egg whites with coconut flour and air fried)

Fish (eggs whites with coconut flour and air fried)

Peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes 

Salads

Italian dressing, low fat ranch, Buffalo sauce

Smoothies

Fruits &amp; 100%juices

Cauliflower Rice

Coffee w/ soy or almond milk 


I may need to add more variety of protein sources. Any advice to keep my diet fun and delicious, let me know your go tos.

0,"so a few years ago I (5""7) weighed 101kg. I hated how I looked I hated how I felt so I made a change in my diet, lots of logging on mfp etc and got down to about 77kg.

Now here are the problems. I have bipolar disorder, pretty badly to the extent that I can't work. If I'm in a really good period and I'm lucky I can be stable for a while and actually look after myself, when I'm not... a lot less so. The medications I take tanked my thyroid so I'm on thyroid replacement medication and alllll of my meds have weight gain as a side effect. The deck is pretty stacked. Right now at least I consider it a good day if I get dressed and don't actively wish to drop down dead.

I just don't know how to motivate myself when an episode can set me back, the last I weighed myself I was back up to 94kg, I lost nearly all the progress I made before. It's hard to log my meals when I can barely get the energy to cook, let alone weigh and portion things as I go. It's hard to make myself workout when I can't even get dressed and leave the house like nine times out of ten. 

I don't want to be fat, I know it makes things worse, I know it makes me feel worse about myself but like... jesus what the hell am I supposed to do here? Everything feels pointless and I can't be consistent with anything because my brain chemistry hates me.

My cholesterol is 220.
LDL- 145.6
HDL-59.7
Triglycerides-91.5

 I am wondering what exactly in my diet is effecting it.
I am overweight. I am losing weight. Down from 216 to 167lb.
I have 2 eggs daily. I reach my daily limit of cholesterol automatically, so everything is an add on and hence a higher value.
Milk, I have around 0.5 cup daily.
Bread, I usually eat whole wheat bread and sometimes whit too. Not more than 2 slices daily. I did add butter to it, 1 tsp.
I don't eat that much of biscuits, cakes. It's an indulgence that I'll also need to cut, including pizza😭 

I do have fried foods in my diet. But they are made in veg oil. Isn't cholesterol effected by trans and saturated fat? Isn't veg oil none of the above? I am extremely confused here.
Most of the oil I use in cooking is olive oil.

So if reduce my daily egg intake, cut out butter, mayo, cheese, milk, potato. It's should work. The fried food and thing is something I need help with. 

I am a bit scared because I don't wanna die. I am hoping once i am in the ideal weight range, that should help. I have been obese for so long. This is the first time in approx 8 years that I have been in the overweight category. I am hoping to go lower in a few month.

I am hoping these changes will ofcourse help the weight loss too.

Being too embarrassed to go to the doctor or not being taken seriously by a medical professional is hard. Not feeling desirable or wanted is hard. Feeling you have to monitor how you hold your body at all times even in your own home is hard. Feeling your body isn't capable of doing strong things like lifting and exercise is hard. Having your thighs burn from chub rub when you do try to exercise or if you forget to apply deodorant when you wear a dress is hard. Feeling like you can't look good in a simple t-shirt and jeans is hard. Dreading walking up stairs or breathing too heavy is hard. Going to the chip aisle and craving none of it but knowing you need to have it is hard. Feeling like you don't crave food but you have to eat is hard. Feeling you come from a genetic destiny that you can't fight is hard. Seeing your parents and knowing you could be the same or worse is hard. Assuming your life will get worse and not better is hard. Feeling out of control of your own future is hard. Seeing other fat people and having compassion for them but not for yourself is hard. Seeing other fat people and hating them because you hate yourself is hard. Random strangers giving you unsolicited weight loss advice is hard.

I eat 1200 calories a day but the weight hasn’t been moving at all recently. I ate 1550 cals yesterday and 2130 today. I wasn’t too concerned with yesterday’s calories but the lack of self-control I had today has worried me in case I can’t reign it back in tomorrow either :(

I need to try and hold myself accountable so to get back on track otherwise I feel like I’ll ruin all my progress and I never want to go back to the weight I started at. It’s just a bit of a panic that I’ll ruin things if I carry on, even though it’s only been 2 days off track.

0,"So my first Reddit post; be gentle. Pandemic, stress, late-night snackage, etc. - I hit 208 in September '20. As a short woman in my 50s this is not a good place, so I downloaded loseit and set a step goal and was kind of embarrassed to find that eating less calories than you burn well, you know. I set a goal of 160 and as of today I'm at 175, feel a million times better, don't feel deprived, and feel this is sustainable. 

Howsomever - the scale I used at the start is an old school type dial scale that might be almost as old as I am, and I think it's about 3-5 pounds off - i.e, I probably started at 213 and am now 180. I've got a digital scale now and comparing weight on the two I think my old monster is accurate enough when it comes to pounds lost (or gained) - If I'm down a pound or two on one I'm done a pound or two on the another. Eventually I'd like to have an accurate measurement, and I know I could just reset my goal using the digital weight - but I just have this thing about using the same scale at least to get to my first goal of ""160 which is really 165,"", and then for subsequent smaller goals (I'd like to get to 145 eventually) just go ahead and reset and use the digital then - it won't bug me to go ""up"" 5 lbs.

I work out a lot and make sure to be in a calorie deficit, on average I eat 1200 calories a day and burn a total 3,000 a day. I no longer have cravings, and honestly I’m never really hungry, however tired a lot of the time (cuz of the low carb intake). I drink a ton of water, make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep, drink at least one cup of green tea a day, and do not snack after dinner. I’ve loved being keto these past 6 months, it has definitely kick started my journey and gotten me in the right “weight loss mindset”.

I’ve spoken to many friends/family about this matter, since you all know, working your ass off and not seeing results is a huge bummer. MANY have suggested to stop doing keto, and I’m having a hard time accepting it.

Not to toot my own horn at all, but I know many people have a hard time sticking to low carb, so the fact that I have maintained it for over 6 months makes me feel like it’s a skill of mine I shouldn’t give up on!

I did get down at one point 7 years ago to 180 but have been going back up ever since.  The last four months have been a text book in inactivity.  The weather was cold, rained and snowed a lot, I fell into deep depression.  I spent my time eating junk and reading comics and playing video games and using every excuse in the world I could find not to exercise.  it has effected my physical health as well as my mental health.  I was talking to my therapist and she asked me why if I took such steps towards improving my metal health why I did nothing for my physical health.  I sat long and hard and the only answer I could think of was because I am lazy.  I have no physical condition that will keep me from working out other then being overweight and getting tired.  I decided that ends as of now.

I talked to my primary care doctor and we had a long appointment where we came up with some things do to to help me stay active.  One thing when I am feeling upset I pace.  So he said i need to turn that into walking.  He said if I start small with things that I dont hate like the walking that will be a good start.  He also talked about a little light jogging.  We then talked about my diet and I wont even get into that.  but we found some healthy foods and meals plans that I am comftable with.  

I have a large area in my yard that I can walk  laps in and the ground is even so I can do some jogging also.  I have a hard time leaving the house and being in public so parks are not the greatest for me.  I also have an area on my back porch for Jumping Jacks.  My mother is also helping.  She got me a fit bit to keep track of my walking.  I am also going to drink water of soda and sugar drinks and thanks to the fit bit app can keep track of how much I drink.  I set a goal of how much I want to walk each day.  I loaded my mp3 player with tons of music to listen to.  my mother is also going to call me several times a day to make sure I am not being lazy.  I have a set time that I will not be playing video games.  Like I said no games between 9am and 6pm and I put a limit on how many comics I can read a day.  On rainy days I can walk in my house.  I live in a trailer so there is a pretty straight shot that I can walk back and forth in.  Just really anything to keep me out of my room and off my butt.

As of today 3-6-21 I weigh 301 pounds.  I have not set a target weight as I do not want to be disappointed if I do not get to it.  

I know this will be hard because I really love just being lazy, playing games, reading comics and watching tv.  

Does anyone maybe have any advice on how to stay motivated?  Like how did you go from lazy to active?

As such, my efforts to be disciplined slightly reduced. I was a bit looser with my restrictions. During the holiday break, after my first semester of school completed, i tired to enjoy myself despite the lockdown. I guess the lack of going out and socializing demotivated me to some extent. So during the holidays I enjoyed myself because “it’s the holidays”. I gained weight and went to the low 180s. Which I thought was fine, I can easily come back down. But I guess one thing led to another, and the further restrictions impacted my mental health (?). I just slowly became less disciplined. Some days I didn’t track, some days I’d track but willingly went over. Now I’m at 193 lbs. Feeling a bit hopeless with myself, and would love some advice regarding this. How do I snap out of it and jump back in it. I suspect the warmer days is what made it easier to go for walks and stay active. The gyms are closed. I bought an exercise bike - but not motivated like before to get moving. Despite the cold I could try to go on walks still. Any advice would be great!",Advice?,"Advice?

I've been going through a weight loss journey since 2014. At my highest, 370. At my lowest, 240. I gained it all back from a series of increasingly bad life decisions, and now I'm back to trying to lose it.

I go and do well for weeks at a time.  Most recently I got down to 328.  I was super proud.  I finally broke the 330 plateau I was on.  Then I had a covid scare at work, had some real problems with a boss, and binged one day. ONE day.  I woke up the next morning, I had gone from 328 to 334 in one bad day decision.

I've been going through a weight loss journey since 2014. At my highest, 370. At my lowest, 240. I gained it all back from a series of increasingly bad life decisions, and now I'm back to trying to lose it.

I go and do well for weeks at a time.  Most recently I got down to 328.  I was super proud.  I finally broke the 330 plateau I was on.  Then I had a covid scare at work, had some real problems with a boss, and binged one day. ONE day.  I woke up the next morning, I had gone from 328 to 334 in one bad day decision. I thought, OK, it was one bad day, there's some water weight, it'll go back down. And here I am a week later, 336. 

Why is it SO hard to get this stupid number to go down, but SO FRICKIN EASY to get it to go back up? It's infuriating and frustrating and flustering."
0,"There are a million and one ways to track calories. Dozens of apps, all kinda things. I've personally found using a google spreadsheet really useful, as I can program it to track things in different ways, and I can access it from both my phone and computer

. I've got one column to track my daily weight, and at the end of each week it averages my weight for the week. One that tracks the day of the week, and the total days in the cycle (this particular sheet is a 12 week sheet). The next totals the calories for the day, and then averages the calories for that week.

When you eat something, just put the calories in the next 'Food' column for that day, and it will automatically add it to your total for that day, as well as calculate its number into your average for the week. If you weigh yourself every day, put that into the 'Current Weight' column, and it will average your weight for the week. This is to give more of an overall weight trend as opposed to once a week weighing, which can fluctuate a bit much.

Because weight loss is a long process, people (myself included) can get lost in the minutia of the day to day. Using the spreadsheet has really helped me to put things into big picture perspective. And because it's helping me, I figured maybe it might help someone else, so I made a blank copy to share with you guys. If you want to make a copy, just go to File, and then 'Make a Copy'.

There's also a couple spots at the top for your Starting Weight, Goal Weight, and Goal Calories per day.

0,"When you have the epiphany (whether it's for the first time or the sixteenth) that you need to lose weight, you want to lose it fast. Whether it comes from disgust with yourself, fear of health effects, or motivation from posters here who lost massive amounts in relatively short amounts of time. 

If you've been around here and read along a bit, you probably have some numbers or phrases memorized. 

-For the average overweight/obese person, you should lose no more than two pounds per week. 

-Women need a minimum of 1200 calories per day. 

-Men need a minimum of 1500 calories per day. 

-You probably shouldn't eat back your exercise calories, at least not all of them. 

If you go too hard and post about losing 5lbs a week or declare a dry fast or eating 1000 calories a day, you'll probably get some push back. 

I'm here to push back about the other half of this mindset, from my point of view as a relatively short woman who had a medium amount of weight to lose. I have tried to lose multiple times, with the help of this subreddit and /r/1200isplenty. 

1200 isn't plenty or sustainable for every woman, and if you're reading this and getting defensive... It may be enough for you. But if you're constantly hungry, thinking about food, your hair is thinning..those are classic signs you're under fueling. 

But what is even sneakier is what's more likely: while under fueling you'll probably snap one day and slip and eat 2400 calories or more. Maybe it turns into multiple days or even weeks of falling off the wagon. You blame yourself for not being able to stay consistent, for not being strong like the women you seeing constantly eating under 1300 calories. 

If you are moderately active and not super short, you probably need more than 1200 calories. ""But wait!"" you say, ""I need a 1000 calorie daily deficit to lose 2 lbs a week, so I have to eat 1250 or less because I'm working from home!""

Have you considered you don't need to lose 2 lbs a week? 

Just because it's the maximum, the fastest possible, doesn't mean it's on your path. Just because 1200 calories is the minimum doesn't mean you need to do that. 

I've had a lot more success eating 1700-2000 calories a day than 1200-1400, and I have more energy and focus. I also will add that I *am* eating exercise calories back (I need to, I'm running 35 miles a week)! It takes a lot of patience, but I know I've more permanently lost this weight this time.

As my regular diet has gotten healthier over the years, there’s a few things I started eating for weight loss that I now love:

1. Turkey. Bacon.
Turkey bacon is delicious. It’s not quite as good as the real thing at first, but it’s crispy and meaty and tasty with only 30 calories a slice and less heart disease. Amazing. I’ll have real bacon sometimes if I go to a diner and it’s good, but I love me some turkey bacon.

2. Cauliflower
It’s basic, but there’s a reason it’s so popular and it’s so tasty and easy to add a little veggie into everything and it adds low calories bulk. Amazing.

3. Nonfat Greek Yogurt
I’ve only added this a few times, but it adds such a high protein low calorie creamy quality to things. I don’t know why I don’t buy it more, but every time I use it *chefs kiss*

4. Black coffee
It took me awhile but I love black coffee, especially with hazelnut

A lot of these you have to work to enjoy, but man they’re so amazing when you make the switch. It’s like when you first start eating spicy food.

There was a post on here around Christmas/ new years that said “in April there are going to be a lot of transformation pictures and if you want to be part of it you need to start now”.

For some reason that really resonated with me. I started making some changes to my habits and working out with YouTube videos. I cant lie, I also kept imagining myself going back to work after COVID and seeing people’s reactions to the new me.

But then there are fucking days like today. Where My job is more stressful, where the kids cry too much and where my wife is mad at me for pretty random things. And instead of blowing off steam by working out, watching Seinfeld or listening to music, i fucking eat until I feel like vomiting.

0,I'm not sure if this is the right or best place to post this but maybe someone can help. Years ago I watched this show about fitness/weight loss that I really enjoyed and I would like to find it and watch more. I believe it was British but I am not sure. It followed 3 people where 1 of them was very skinny and was gaining weight and muscle. Another one was very fit but was too large and he ate like 6k calories per day so he wanted to become smaller. And the 3rd one was also pretty big but he had a lot of fat because he was lifting super heavy weights so he wanted to be more lean. All of them were also introduced to one another and worked out together to help them with their goals and to share the techniques. If anyone can help me find the name of this show I would greatly appreciate it.

0,"Hi everyone!

I am a chronic lurker but this sub has really been helpful during the last year. I have been overweight my entire life, compounded with being tall which always gives a complex about being a ""big girl"". In middle school we moved and I really blew up at that point due to depression and anxiety, with my primary coping skill being comfort eating.

When I was a teen I was sent to an outdoors program for almost 2 years. I went in weighing 315 at age 16 and came out at 215 at age 18. However, I immediately started gaining weight the minute I had choices of intake. My heaviest that I actually weighed myself at was 404 pounds in 2015. In 2019, I had a herniated disc that spilled into my spinal canal and compressed the nerve bundle at the end of my spine, paralyzing me from the waist down. My first weigh in after a few years put me at 390 in the hospital. I wish I could say I started making changes then, but that wasn't the case. Luckily, I've regained my ability to walk and am very mobile again.

When COVID hit, I was sitting at home doing my usual binging on take out. One day, I was eating some peanut butter oreos, and polished off the pack during the day. This wasn't anything out of the ordinary or even that much. But somehow, something clicked that day. I thought, ""I can't go on like this, and what do I want to look back at this pandemic time and say I did?"" So I committed to using the Loseit app again.

I'd been on diets since age 11 and I would always go hard for about a month and then slip back to old habits. I never created anything I could sustain. This time, I implemented small changes, a few at a time. The biggest difference was that I started eating healthier. I always just did portion/calorie control but still with junk. I do restricted time windows for eating (11 am - 7 pm), low calorie, macronutrients balance of at least 30% protein and under 100g net carbs, logging EVERYTHING before I put it in my mouth, fiber/sodium monitoring, and very limited sugar. I haven't been perfect and that's ok, but the most foundational piece has been to log no matter what. I have to look at it, whether I have a bad day and eat a ton of pizza, or a good day when I eat super healthy.

At first I was waiting to inevitably fail again, but eventually I realized I have really been able to turn a corner and stay consistent. I'm excited to keep going and reach my final goal. It feels possible and this time is different. I've already been thinking about how to do maintenance successfully and have some plans for that.

But when you are on a diet for health reasons or to be healthier in general, EVERYONE become a dietician and interfere with your diet and telling you, you are ok the way you are and you don’t have to diet. Also, judging your food choices and trying to sabotage it by offering food.

From my experience in the pasts, they just want to be the prettier, slimmer friends/family of mine. So when we hang out, attention are always on them :)

I actually ate below my maintenance calories today! I ate about 1500 today, my TDEE is 1800 (or 1900 but I try to not eat more than 1800). I ate a 9piece mcnugget and I was kinda surprised to find out that’s only 435 cals. Thought it would be more. But yeah, I ate at a calorie deficit for like literally the first time in my life. I will keep going and I will get better and stronger with time.

I also did my first 16:8 fast today (I started 6pm yesterday, finished today 10am). Honestly, it was much easier than I thought it would be, and I felt surprisingly good afterwards. I thought I’d be starving but I wasn’t, I was just a bit hungry for a few hours, but it was perfectly manageable. I’m starting my second ever 16:8 fast in half an hour, but this time I’m doing 10pm to 12am because I feel like that fits my lifestyle much better (I go to sleep really late etc. so this way it’s more fitting)

Just wanted to get this out there. I’m super proud of myself. Here’s to a fucking healthier and happier life I guess!!!!!!

0,"First post ever! Apologies in advance for the “TLDR” material. 

Let me start by saying I am so happy to have found this corner of the internet. Whenever I’ve gone through tough times in my life, finding a community that somehow understands my struggles has played a huge role in my recovery.

A little bit of background about me, I’m a Female, 31 years old, 5’3. SW: 170 CW: 158 GW:120.

Like a lot of you, I’ve been dealing with being overweight/obese for most of my life. I hit my highest weight when I was 15, at ~210 pounds. 

Coming from a family of slim beautiful girls, and living in a culture where looks are everything, this certainly made me feel “less worthy”. It was back then when I first decided I wanted to change my life.

By the time I turned 16 I had managed to lose 60 pounds. I did this with the help of a professional who taught me about calories, nutrients, metabolism, and helped me find healthy replacements for my then poor food choices.

Here’s when things started to derail. You see, naturally, I hit a plateau at this point. And though I’d lost a ton of weight and was healthier than ever, I never really had any other motivation for losing weight than to “be skinny and beautiful”

At 150lbs I still hated my body, maybe even more now that I was getting stretch marks all over me. I wanted to push this Plateau so badly that I started overworking and over restricting myself, which eventually led to me quitting, convincing myself that I was “never gonna be beautiful, so might as well stop being miserable and make myself happy with what I loved the most: food”

Lucky for me, I didn’t gain all the weight back, but I did gain some, and after seeing a trend and getting really worried, I went to a new professional. This time around I became literally obsessed with losing weight, to the point of not following my doctor’s meal plan because I thought it had “too many calories”. I lost weight alright, I went down to 114lbs -my lowest ever. But as you can guess, I couldn’t keep it off.

This was a tumultuous time. I was depressed, engaged in self destructing behavior, and eventually (at 19) I diagnosed with Disordered Eating and BPD. 

After my mental recovery, I gained a lot of weight again. This was almost unavoidable due to some of the medication I was taking and other circumstances. I think I had hit ~185lbs when I realized I had to get it together or this would backtrack all my personal progress and send me back into a depressive episode. 

That time around I lost the weight in a more healthy way, and I managed to remain in an “OK” weight (~140lbs) for a few years. 

But of course, life happens: Marriage, Office Job, Devastating Hip Arthritis Diagnosis followed by a very unsuccessful, traumatizing, painful and life changing surgery from which I never recovered fully and that left me using a cane to walk. Then divorce. 

*Trigger Warning*

As a depressive person, I honestly don’t know how I managed to not kill myself during this time. Losing my hip, then my husband, living alone in another country and struggling to walk from my bed to my bathroom in my very very tiny apartment. 

But I pulled through like never before. Maybe it was the years of therapy, maybe I just had no other choice. And eventually I met the love of my life, I landed the job of my dreams, and had a beautiful and healthy daughter.

I finally found a GOOD reason why I want to lose weight: I want to be healthier. I want to reduce the pain on my legs so I can play with my kid, live a better life, and stay strong. My disease is chronic and degenerative, so If I don’t do this, I’ll probably wont walk at all by the time I’m 50. 

The 12 pounds I’ve lost so far have already made such a huge difference in my mobility. Not to mention my energy levels! 

I’m sad that I had to go through all of this but happy I finally understood that we really need to treat our bodies better because we only have one life. And that my goals should be oriented towards that: a healthy and well nourished body. 

I guess the saying is true, you never know what you have until you lose it! Now that my body is a lot more fragile I really see the importance of taking care of myself! And this has made my weight-loss almost effortless because I feel happy and proud of treating my body the right way.

And the added bonus: teaching my child healthy habits so that she doesn’t have to suffer later on in life like I did.

Happy Friday! 

Weigh in daily, enter in Libra &amp; report here even if I don’t like it: 231.4 this morning, 231.1 lbs trend weight. Heeeey guess who has a uterus in full-fledged violent coup? This lady.

Just stepped on the scale this morning, its a weekly thing I do on Friday just to track my progress. Small or big , I am always excited to see the outcome! Today when I stepped on that scale it read 299. I shed a tear of excitement. I have not been at this weight since highschool and it is amazing to even say that. Sure it is only a pound under 300 but I know that with my commitment it is not going to go up anymore! 

 I never in a million years thought I would be able to commit and actually make progress in losing the weight.

I honestly thought my ability to dance was genetic because my entire family were so bad at it as well. I would ask my friends for help in school and I was literally told never to dance in public, that there's no hope for me, etc in dead seriousness. And these were people that were completely nice otherwise and so would have no reason to make me feel bad.

I should also mention that dancing is a very big part of my culture so the average person essentially has the skill of a professional dancer. It got in the way of my life a lot in several ways. And even by normal standards (I moved to the West) I was still considered an atrocious dancer.

I went to the very basics. In my culture, the hips are a very very important part of dancing. So I watched a belly dancing tutorial. That was all it took.

TW: disordered eating, also I am in no way encouraging eating the way I did, just giving you my story and seeking advice.

This year so far has unfortunately been a tough one for me in terms of food. When I was overweight I struggled with binge eating (wasn’t diagnosed) and it got to the point where I was doing it almost everyday. Fast forward to September 2020 and I started practicing portion control. Towards the end of October I got started CICO with a combo of intermittent fasting. It ended up working out great obviously and I finally start to lose weight and had not binged since before I started losing, there were a few days I overate but they couldn’t compare to how I was eating before.

Since I got down to around 132 I had been feeling slightly hungrier even though I’d been eating around 1400 calories since the beginning of my journey. I started getting a little impatient because I’ve been sedentary for the most part and knew I needed to create a bigger deficit because I wasn’t burning as much as before. So I did that and it was going okay until recently.

About a week ago I was PMSing and I had cravings so I had a few maintenance days to combat this problem and it normally works out okay. Well this time I overate 2 days in a row and ended with a binge on the last day, which was at least 4000+ calories (I didn’t count). I ate past the point of being sick (although somehow I didn’t throw up) and afterwards I was in so much pain that I literally thought my stomach was going to burst. I hadn’t eaten like that in so long and I’m not that big of a person so I suffered in the days that followed. When I stepped on the scale the next morning I weighed 137 and I panicked. So I restricted the next 4 days and ate under 1000 calories. I know it’s not okay to eat this much or little but I wasn’t really thinking straight and wanted to get back down to my original weight quickly. It worked and I got back down to 132 so I decided I would eat 1200 and have one maintenance day of 1600 per week. 

Yesterday I ate 2000 instead of 1600 for my maintenance day and today I ate my actual maintenance rather than going back down to 1200. The kicker is I’m still hungry (yay!). I know some of you will say “1200 isn’t enough! Your young and that’s what a toddler needs, blah, blah, blah.” Please don’t tell me this. I am a short person with a low TDEE and even with extra walking I can’t eat a lot. I also don’t do high intensity exercise because it increases my hunger. I am waiting to start doing more workouts once I hit my goal range so I can eat an adequate amount. 

So that’s what’s happened so far and I’m just struggling. Ever since I’ve got to the low 130s my hunger has been out of control. I just have a strong desire to eat and I don’t even remember how I did it the rest of the time when I was in a deficit. I’ve heard a bit about having a “set point” in terms of weight and I think 134 may be mine. The lowest weight I can remember weighing at this height was 134 and then I went up from there. No matter what it seems like I can’t get past 130 and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried eating at different times of the day from 5 meals to 2 meals (I think 2 works best) but it isn’t helping anymore. I already also practice volume eating and I make sure to eat enough protein, so I’m just like: what else can I do?!?

My last solution is to take a maintenance break for about 2 weeks and then slowly go down by 50 calories each week until I reach 1300. I’ve taken maintenance breaks before and I was going to do so at 130 but I guess I’m going to start it now. If anyone has any advice or has experienced this I would really appreciate hearing your thoughts! I don’t know any other solutions and I’m feeling pretty frustrated after these past few months.",In need of advice even though I already have somewhat of a solution.,"In need of advice even though I already have somewhat of a solution. 17F 5’2 SW: 160 CW: 132 GW: 110-120

I’ve heard a bit about having a “set point” in terms of weight and I think 134 may be mine. The lowest weight I can remember weighing at this height was 134 and then I went up from there. No matter what it seems like I can’t get past 130 and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried eating at different times of the day from 5 meals to 2 meals (I think 2 works best) but it isn’t helping anymore. I already also practice volume eating and I make sure to eat enough protein, so I’m just like: what else can I do?!?

My last solution is to take a maintenance break for about 2 weeks and then slowly go down by 50 calories each week until I reach 1300. I’ve taken maintenance breaks before and I was going to do so at 130 but I guess I’m going to start it now. If anyone has any advice or has experienced this I would really appreciate hearing your thoughts! I don’t know any other solutions and I’m feeling pretty frustrated after these past few months."

0,Here is what I have found out about water and weight loss. Starting the day by filling stomach up with water and waiting until hunger passes to eat or to wait thirty minutes before doing some cardio(calorie burning) has helped me lose 80 lbs. spacing your meals out and fighting hunger by the use of water is the safest method of weight loss I have tried and it is the only way the weight has stayed off. Staying with water for a consistent 3 months(no alcohol) has allowed my cellular processes to change so that my metabolism is up and I am now accustomed to getting energy from nutritious diet of my choosing.,The power of water.,The power of water.

- Current weight: 284.6
- Weight lost: 25.4
- Goal weight: 137
- Left to go: 147.6

Today I hit my first milestone which was -25 lbs. 

I started at Christmas when my sister got engaged. She’s in the Air Force Academy and can’t get married until she graduates in 2024 so that’s more than enough time for me to lose all my weight, so it motivated me to get started.

First I started by only eating lean cuisines and tracking all my calories in My Fitness Pal. Yes I know OMG THE SODIUM. You know what else has lots of sodium? Getting fast food 3 times a day. I had to start somewhere. I did it to relearn portion sizes. I was never really a snacker I was just eating huge meals. I started eating 3 lean cuisines plus having 3 healthy snacks throughout the day.

Then as time went on I slowly started phasing out the lean cuisines. I still haven’t weaned off them completely, I still have a few per week. I have a lot to learn with cooking and meal prep. But I’m doing well so far.

Currently I am eating 1300 calories a day and not doing much exercise. I go to an aqua fit class 2 times per week. I’m trying to get out and walk my dog more but I’ve been bad about it.

As far as a reward for hitting this milestone goes.. I know rewarding with food is frowned upon but there’s not any material thing I want so my husband and I were trying to think of more “experience” type rewards. That’s hard right now with covid. So we settled on getting really good quality sushi and getting a bunch of random things we’ve never tried before. 

My next milestone is 270 which is 14.6 pounds down from where I’m at now. My happy scale app predicts I’ll hit that on June 16. But they also predicted I’d hit this milestone on April 9 which was over a month off so hopefully I can beat the June 16 deadline!",I hit milestone 1/12!!!,"I hit milestone 1/12!!! - Starting weight: 310

0,"I have very mixed feelings after I went on the scale today for the first time since six months (!). 

I started the previous weight-loosing cycle November 2018 with a starting weight of 195 lbs (female, 5'6''). The following month I lost continually weight and around November 2019 I had lost 30 lbs (CICO + moderate weight lifting program). But then the corona pandemic hit. Most of the time the gyms were closed and I worked nearly the whole time from home. Between March 2019 and August 2019 I gained a little weight but not too dramatic. Because of lack of movement and working (sitting) more I got problems with my back, which caused me to move (initially) even less. 

I knew that I gained even more weight as my clothing began to fit more tightly, but I was so afraid of seeing the damage that I avoided the scale. Today I mustered enough courage to step on the scale. What can I say: with 192 lbs I almost weigh as much as I did last in November 2018... Although this is so frustrating, I am somehow relieved. I feel like I took over control again with stepping on the scale and knowing how much I weigh. 

I am motivated to lose this weight again, and hopefully even more. My dream-weight is 145 lbs.

0,"Hello all, and Happy Friday! First off, I want to thank everyone in this community - I've been around off and on \~5 years, and this really is such an uplifting and inspiring community. 

So, I want to share some struggles I've had recently, in the hope that it will be cathartic for me, and also hopefully will help others who are also struggling. 

Current stats: 30F, 5'6"", HW:175lb, SW: 168lb, CW: 143lb, GW: 130lb (reached in January 2021...not there currently)

Background: I've struggled with being overweight since my early teens. I started gaining around age 11-12 or so, and by the time I was 15, I weighed 175. At the time, my mom went on a low carb diet and began losing weight. I followed something similar, but not strictly low carb, just less food in general, but still ate some carbs and junk food. Tried to move more, etc. By the time I was 16, I was about 145lb or so, and pretty happy with that. By the time I was 18, I had gotten to \~132 without trying - I think having active jobs helped. At age 18, there were a lot of changes in my life: moved out, started university, started drinking, and started a toxic relationship. That all results in a slow gain over the next few years, and although there were MANY attempts to lose weight, none of them really stuck. The combo of the relationship, stress and drinking did not do me any favors. 

Beginning of 2013, age 23, I was 160 pounds, and just starting a new relationship. I quickly gained 15 pounds in \~9 months or so due to eating a bit more junk and bigger portion sizes (the new bf is very active and eats OMAD...so I shouldn't be eating anywhere close to what he does.) At that point, I had reached my HW of 175 again, and I realized I needed to make a change, and started losing (I was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic based on A1C, so that gave me a concrete health reason to lose weight.) From 2014-2019, I cycled from 143-165 several times, each time not quite getting to my goal of 130. I learned valuable things with each cycle - for example, I dropped breakfast a long time ago, and almost never eat it now (I eat more through the day when I do eat breakfast.) I realized low carb is not for me, and I can't sustain it forever, so it's better to for me to just calorie count. However, I also need to focus on healthier foods overall for sustainability and health. Thankfully, my A1C has been in the normal range every time I've had it checked since 2014. 

Cue to June 2019 - back at 168lb, and I knew I had to do something about it. I read something here on loseit that really helped me change my perspective. ""Don't let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway."" From then on I decided I had to make small, slow, SUSTAINABLE (i.e., lifestyle) changes, or I would keep on weight cycling forever. I started just counting calories again and aiming for some type of workout 2x per week. From there, I slowly continued to add things, adjust, etc., not focusing on how long it would take at all. Focusing on sustainable habits, consistency and patience. From June 2019 to December 2020, I went from 168 to 132 pounds, which is close to 0.5lb/week. 

Mid-December 2020: I quit smoking weed due to a possible new job (I started smoking in 2013, which has helped reduce drinking drastically since then. There is some willpower initially to not give in to munchies.) From there, I lost weight pretty quickly, and saw my GW of 130 on January 2, 2021. At this point, I was toying with whether or not I should go to 125, and then try to gain muscle. On January 14th (after seeing 129 a couple times!) I decided, this is it, I should try to focus on maintenance for now. That same day, I got rejected for the job I was applying for. Cue weed smoking again that evening. I decided to eat some of the christmas chocolates we had around (I really didn't indulge much over christmas due to not having much of an appetite.) That was all fine, I logged everything, and didn't go crazy. Two days later, on January 16th, we found out that our dog had cancer. Literally, one of my best friends, and my baby...I'm getting teary eyed just typing this out. We were in shock, and not sure how much longer we'd have with her. This is when healthy habits just started getting thrown out the window - no calorie counting, no workouts. I had to spend as much time with her as possible. The next day, we decided we had to put her down sooner than later due to some difficulty she was having with walking (the tumor was growing very quickly.) We called the next morning, and scheduled her appt for later that day. Since then, my ass has been kicked in trying to deal with the grief of losing her. Long story short, I'm back up to 143 pounds about 6 weeks later, which is not good. I do not want all of my progress to be undone. I've managed to mostly keep up with workouts, which is good. Food has been a struggle though. I definitely am an emotional eater, and I'm really trying to find ways to deal with the emotions better. Working out does help, but at night when I miss her...emotional eating can easily undo all of the hard work of working out. I committed again yesterday to log everything, no matter what. I had tried to restart logging several times, but just struggled with it. I'm in a little better place now...still missing her terribly, but I know that I will regret it if I don't course-correct now. 

I just needed to get this off my chest, and I appreciate every single person who took the time to read this. You can only do your best, and your best looks different every day. Remember to give yourself grace and understanding. Life is not easy, and there will be struggles. Even if you didn't make good decisions last week, yesterday, this morning - you can still make a good decision right now. I believe in you.","Hit goal weight in January after a slow loss (0.5lb/week), then had loss and grief to deal with...now up 13 pounds","Hit goal weight in January after a slow loss (0.5lb/week), then had loss and grief to deal with...now up 13 pounds Hello all, and Happy Friday!

I quickly gained 15 pounds in \~9 months or so due to eating a bit more junk and bigger portion sizes (the new bf is very active and eats OMAD...so I shouldn't be eating anywhere close to what he does.) At that point, I had reached my HW of 175 again, and I realized I needed to make a change, and started losing (I was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic based on A1C, so that gave me a concrete health reason to lose weight.) From 2014-2019, I cycled from 143-165 several times, each time not quite getting to my goal of 130. I learned valuable things with each cycle - for example, I dropped breakfast a long time ago, and almost never eat it now (I eat more through the day when I do eat breakfast.) I realized low carb is not for me, and I can't sustain it forever, so it's better to for me to just calorie count. However, I also need to focus on healthier foods overall for sustainability and health. Thankfully, my A1C has been in the normal range every time I've had it checked since 2014. 

Cue to June 2019 - back at 168lb, and I knew I had to do something about it. I read something here on loseit that really helped me change my perspective. ""Don't let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway."" From then on I decided I had to make small, slow, SUSTAINABLE (i.e., lifestyle) changes, or I would keep on weight cycling forever. I started just counting calories again and aiming for some type of workout 2x per week. From there, I slowly continued to add things, adjust, etc., not focusing on how long it would take at all. Focusing on sustainable habits, consistency and patience. From June 2019 to December 2020, I went from 168 to 132 pounds, which is close to 0.5lb/week. 

Mid-December 2020: I quit smoking weed due to a possible new job (I started smoking in 2013, which has helped reduce drinking drastically since then. There is some willpower initially to not give in to munchies.) From there, I lost weight pretty quickly, and saw my GW of 130 on January 2, 2021. At this point, I was toying with whether or not I should go to 125, and then try to gain muscle. On January 14th (after seeing 129 a couple times!) I decided, this is it, I should try to focus on maintenance for now. That same day, I got rejected for the job I was applying for. Cue weed smoking again that evening. I decided to eat some of the christmas chocolates we had around (I really didn't indulge much over christmas due to not having much of an appetite.) That was all fine, I logged everything, and didn't go crazy. Two days later, on January 16th, we found out that our dog had cancer. Literally, one of my best friends, and my baby...I'm getting teary eyed just typing this out. We were in shock, and not sure how much longer we'd have with her. This is when healthy habits just started getting thrown out the window - no calorie counting, no workouts. I had to spend as much time with her as possible. The next day, we decided we had to put her down sooner than later due to some difficulty she was having with walking (the tumor was growing very quickly.) We called the next morning, and scheduled her appt for later that day. Since then, my ass has been kicked in trying to deal with the grief of losing her. Long story short, I'm back up to 143 pounds about 6 weeks later, which is not good. I do not want all of my progress to be undone. I've managed to mostly keep up with workouts, which is good. Food has been a struggle though. I definitely am an emotional eater, and I'm really trying to find ways to deal with the emotions better. Working out does help, but at night when I miss her...emotional eating can easily undo all of the hard work of working out. I committed again yesterday to log everything, no matter what. I had tried to restart logging several times, but just struggled with it. I'm in a little better place now...still missing her terribly, but I know that I will regret it if I don't course-correct now. 

I just needed to get this off my chest, and I appreciate every single person who took the time to read this. You can only do your best, and your best looks different every day. Remember to give yourself grace and understanding. Life is not easy, and there will be struggles. Even if you didn't make good decisions last week, yesterday, this morning - you can still make a good decision right now. I believe in you."
0,"For starters: I'm a 21 year old woman and I'm 165 cm (5'5""). So, in February 2020 I've reached my lowest weight ever, which was 59 kg (130 lbs) and I was absolutely overjoyed, as I've been working on getting to that point for over 3 months. And then COVID struck and I left my uni city to spend lockdown with my parents aaaaand... well, started gaining weight.

Just to be clear: although I was fit, I was also quite unhealthy. I was cold all the damn time, I couldn't stop thinking about food, I lost my period (and got it back after over half a year). So when lockdown started and eventually lasted for more than expected 2 weeks, I started bingeing. Regularly.

In summer I weighed myself for the first time since February, because I was too scared to see how much exactly I've put on. And well, I weighed 78 kg (172 lbs). I, of course, decided that I needed to lose it all back again, especially since the pandemic supposedly was coming to an end in my country and I just couldn't look at myself in the mirror. Unsurprisingly, I failed and not only did not *lose* any weight, I actually started eating absolutely *massive* amounts of food, mostly because I was living alone at the time and felt no pressure, since the second lockdown started and I've only hung out with friend over zoom etc. Looking back now, I have no idea how I could stuff myself so much. It's like a different lifetime.

Anyways, I again moved back to my parents and I thought, ""well, it's now or never, let's just do it"". Sadly, I just couldn't get motivated. Like, at all. Fortunately, since I now actually lived with people, I worked on my ridiculous eating habits and now, after 3 months, I can say I eat fairly healthy.

BUT I have not weighed myself since summer, simply because I was too scared to see how much more I've put on. But today I woke up and felt good about it and made use of my scale. I officially weigh the most I've ever had in my entire life, which is 81 kg (178 lbs). I'm not mortified. I'm not angry. I'm just tired of living in this weird and ungracious body and I miss my lovely clothes. I feel like I finally got the kick in the butt that I've so desperately needed. And so today was the first day in the last x months that I actually stuck to my calories. I did a FBW that I used to do and I enjoyed it *so much*!

I guess I'm posting this all to hold myself accountable, because regular journals never seem to work for me.

0,"I just discovered this community (is that what it’s called?) and I’m hoping it will give me the motivation I need and help me find some answers :/

I’m a 20 year old female. I’ve been overweight almost my entire life. My highest weight is 222.8 pounds (I’m 5’6) and I’ve gotten down to 198.4 since September.

Ive tried to lose weight numerous times. In high school, I struggled with anorexia for about a year and lost about 50 pounds in 2 months. I got down to my lowest weight, which was 145 pounds. Due to stress and depression, I eventually started showing signs of binge eating disorder and ate my way up to 222lbs.

Another important part of my story is that I have had rheumatoid arthritis since I was 4 years. It is hard for me to be in my feet for more than 2 or 3 hours. I have limited mobility in my ankles, which makes it hard for me to run and do certain exercises. I try my best to workout and get in as many steps as I can, but I have promised myself that I will not push my body too far in terms of my arthritis.

So flash forward to today. I have lost almost 25 pounds, which sounds pretty good. But it has taken me 6 months. 

When I lost those 25 pounds, I was not exercising. I was on a strict 1200-1300 calorie “diet”- I know now that this was NOT healthy!!! I was dropping weight so fast, but eventually I would binge, which lead me to eating whatever I wanted for 2-3 weeks.

I take full accountability. I know I should have stuck with it, but I didn’t. I promised myself I would not give up this time, so every time I failed, I eventually picked myself back up.

But ever since the start of the new year, I have been having so much trouble losing weight. I have barely lost a thing. Maybe 5 pounds at most.

In January I ate about 1300-1400 calories a day. No exercise. Didn’t lose anything. I took a week off and ate whatever I wanted to try to reset my metabolism. Started dieting again, weighed in and lost 4 pounds. The next week I weighed in and lost absolutely nothing. Not even an ounce.

So I took a week off again and ate whatever I wanted then started the diet again. I started to exercise and ate about 1500 calories. Like I said, I don’t get many steps in due to my arthritis, but I was burning enough calories through exercise to get me down to 1200 calories per day.

I have been doing that since mid February, and have barely seen results.

I weighed in last week and only lost .4 pounds.

Today I looked down at my stomach to see new stretch marks. I broke down into tears? How?!? Why?!? I know for a fact I have not gained. It is just not possible. There is no way. 

What am I doing wrong?

Is it possible that I am losing weight but gaining enough muscle each week to balance it out... since I’m new to working out?

I just feel so discouraged. I’ve been working so hard. Should I exercise more? And burn more calories?

I drink almost a gallon of water a day!!

I just want to give up. I know I can’t. But I want to.

I take measurements, and I lost 4 inches last week, but I’ve convinced myself that it’s because I didn’t measure in the exact same spot that I did the week before. 

I don’t look any different. I don’t look like I’ve lost weight within the last month or so.

What’s wrong with me? Does anyone have advice or insight? Their own experience? Help, please. I just don’t know what to do. I am so tired of living like this, and I just want to be healthy and confident for once in my lifetime.","I promised myself I wouldn’t give up, but I’m so discouraged.","I promised myself I wouldn’t give up, but I’m so discouraged.

All levels of runner are welcome here, from first timers to experienced  marathoners. We welcome someone who just ran for the first time or is just starting couch to 5K ([r/c25k](https://www.reddit.com/r/c25k/)) as eagerly as someone who has thousands of miles of experience.

This post is for sharing your weekly progress or excitement with running. From training you got in this last week, your first run, a virtual race, or a real race, we'd love to hear what you did. Got a running related NSV (non-scale victory), we'd love to hear. Have a question or need advice, we are here to help.

In addition to sharing your progress each week, I ramble on about some topic related to running. This week's topic -- Running and Insulin Sensitivity. I will say before I dive into this material, I'm no scientist. I don't pretend to be an expert here. 

# Insulin Sensitivity

I think when people seen the word insulin, they immediately think diabetes. But insulin manages the level of blood sugar in all people -- with or without diabetes. So, how sensitive you are to insulin in your body means you manage your blood sugar levels better with less insulin in your blood stream. At some point a tiny bit of insulin takes care of managing your glucose level. Now decreased insulin sensitivity, mainly as it decreases or is poor to insulin resistance levels, is something that leads to type 2 diabetes. This is the condition where you need more and more insulin to manage your blood sugar. 

# Running and Insulin Sensitivity

The article here is 10 years old, but it's still incredibly relevant today.  

[Exercise and Insulin Sensitivity—Where Do We Stand? You’d Better Run!](https://www.touchendocrinology.com/diabetes/journal-articles/exercise-and-insulin-sensitivity-where-do-we-stand-youd-better-run/)

There's two incredible things that regular running does for you. 

First, it increases your sensitivity after a single session of running. And, after regular running for six weeks, it's nearly twice the increase in sensitivity.  And if you have some insulin resistant condition, there is great evidence that the response is even greater. The only dissenting evidence is that the response is equal to those without any conditions. 

Second, more insulin sensitivity helps you develop lean mass over adipose fat. I can't say this part enough. One of the amazing things that exercise gives you is it unlocks more and more the ability of your body to use calories to build lean mass. Insulin sensitivity tracks to opening those pathways to put on muscle -- but it isn't the whole story. 

# Is Running special in this regard?

Running is the sweet spot here. Any exercise is great for you. It's moderate/vigorous aerobic exercise. Less intense exercise doesn't do as well, and resistance exercise results are uncertain. 

# If you don't use it, you lose it

This is a common joke punchline but it's very true with the benefits of exercise on insulin sensitivity. Regular exercise pays off greatly. But the increase in sensitivity drops away much faster than your fitness. Just two or three days, and your sensitivity drops. Not all the way, and you are always just one run away from those benefits. So, get out there 2-3 times a week -- that's all it takes.",Running with LoseIt - 3/5/2021 - Running and Insulin Sensitivity,"Running with LoseIt - 3/5/2021 - Running and Insulin Sensitivity This is a 'weekly' post for the runners of LoseIt.

Okay so 45 lbs (20.4 kg) isn't a whole lot compared to lots of you amazing folks, but it definitely shows on someone my height! I was at my heaviest in 2018 and absolutely hated myself. I had always been a tad overweight, but It shocked me how I just kept climbing and climbing.

I recall sitting in my car one night (alone and sad af) eating hella taco bell like I did basically every night, thinking to myself ""I will never, ***never*** change.""

Overall, I'd say I have been actively losing weight strictly for around 1.5 years. The journey has been incredibly slow, but I think that the fact that I have held steadfast on my weight loss through ALL the plateaus I hit, proves to me that I am capable of keeping this up for a *long* time. I am super fuckin proud of my progress and my body.

Awesome things that happened on my weight loss journey:

* I stopped ripping holes into all my jeans and leggings in my thigh area due to chub rub
* I know BMI doesn't mean much but I went from Obese &gt;&gt; Normal
* I lost almost 1/3 of my body weight
* I hit the weight 123.4 (heh)
* I saw my pelvic bones one day. I remember sitting in bed just moving my hips around in awe.
* I had a tendency to buy clothes that were too dang small for me. I started fitting into them!! then they got too big for me :( -- but really :)
* My flatter belly just keeps shocking me every time i look at myself in the mirror or sit down.
* I don't start wheezing when I do random normal shit
* I can see my collarbone
* Every time I lost weight after 140, I would announce to my friends, I'M tHe LoWeST I'Ve BeEn in 12 YeARS!!

Some info about what I do:

* I do CICO and eat 1100-1200 a day. I started with keto though!
* I sort of do OMAD (700-800 cal meals once a day)
* I weigh all my food, ALL OF IT
* I am conscious that the world is not portioning shit for a 5''0 female
* Avoid sugar where possible. Use sugar substitutes
* I didn't do any exercise (regrettably), but I am going to start soon and I have more stamina when I go out walking now for sure.
* I am patient. Plateaus happen.
* Recognize that weight loss is absolutely about lifestyle changes, not dieting.

0,"Something snapped in my head again and I am counting calories again. I have done it at least a dozen times in past 15 years.

0,"So I started taking Phentermine for weight loss last week and so far haven't noticed much change on the scales however I have to say my concentration has become much better and I feel much happier going to work every day as I am much less stressed with the work. Today, I decided to not eat and see how long it takes me to become hungry as the drug is primarily to my understanding a stimulant and an appetite suppressant.   I have managed to get to 6pm without a meal quite comfortably (plenty of water) but I am considering eating something soon.  I am tempted to try  intermittent fasting on weekends. So my questions is has anyone had success intermittent fasting with phentermine and also did your ability to concentrate change?

Edit 7/3/21: 
Thanks for the replies, I see a lot of cautions and so I would like to elaborate on my situation. I am currently tracking and adapting my eating habits to increase my protein, fibrous carbohydrates, some additional fat and largely reduce my starchy carbohydrates although I do not plan to cut them completely. I strongly feel that despite what keto enthusiasts say it is beneficial and quite natural to have a low to moderate portion of carbs included in my diet and that this will be more sustainable in the long run.  Every meal I have eaten since taking the medication has been home cooked which I think is highly significant coming from eating junk food all day. I am planning my shopping days now to ensure I have food in the fridge at all times.  I am also working towards a caloric deficit of beneath 1800, that said, I have researched intermittent fasting and believe it could be greatly beneficial so long as my diet is also changed.  I'm not new to keto and have done it before but found it was unsustainable after about a month, I just craved a sandwich or a cracker, I feel this is what everyone who does it goes through but some can tolerate it more than others.  Note: I'm not knocking keto, if it works for you then great. I'm just saying its not a lifestyle choice I can cope with.

This week I have also joined a gym (did a weights session today which felt great) and plan to attend indoor cycling classes 3 times a week and doing weights twice a week.  I'm fully committed to tracking my caloric intake, macros, exercise and change my lifestyle completely. I'm ""All in"" as they say and I feel the phentermine is the ace up my sleeve.  As far as my mental health goes; I did have a lull the other day from being kept up a few hours at night from the medication but other than that I am generally feeling absolutely incredible; focused, happier, less stressed and looking forward to the future. In contrast, prior to taking phentermine, I was very easily distracted with my own thoughts and working  a highly technical role this made my job extremely stressful (which leads to more eating), actually it was like I constantly had other things to think about and I felt my work was the distraction, now its my focal point.  Anyway, to summarise; I am fully aware that a lifestyle change is needed to reduce my weight permanently (120kg btw).  I'm using phentermine on a temporary basis and as it was intended: to kick start my weight loss journey.

0,"Hi fellow losers,

It's been a long and weird journey getting here, but I just wanted to share my feelings about health and weightloss and hopefully some of you can relate.

I have no incredible weight loss to report, in fact, I've been hovering up and down for several weeks now, but for the first time in my life when trying to lose weight, I haven't given up and I haven't been discouraged. I've never stuck with a lifestyle change long enough to understand what it is I need to do to succeed, when things hadn't gone my way in the past, I'd just give up and double-down to find I'd gained another 10+ pounds a few months later.

I have lost weight before - 75lbs! But I lost it by eating almost nothing and allowing myself to fall into an incredible depression that made starving myself an appealing type of self-punishment.

For this and other reasons, obviously I gained it all back. 

For over 2 months now, however, I've been on MFP and WW. I track most days, even on really bad days. I've had days where I don't track and weeks where I felt like giving up. I've gone from going on walks consistently to falling back into old sedentary habits, to walking consistently and then back again.

My point is, the process has been messy. It's been imperfect and inconstant. And yet, I've stuck to it.

Like a baby learning to walk, you have to crawl before you can run. I feel so good about just trying and failing and still fighting to get better at this everyday. Though my weight has gone up and down, I've maintained a 10lb loss overall from where I started, and as I get better and better at learning how to tailor my journey to my habits and goals, I can't wait to look back on this time with even more pride than I already feel now.

In my opinion, this is how you lose weight. Not by crash dieting and not by obsessively managing every aspect of your weight loss with overzealous perfectionism. You try. You fail.

So after a year training with a basic set of dumbells (15 pounds) and doing insanity t-25 as well as CICO.  I was able to lose 55 pounds. 

Cut all alchool, lower the bread intake, raise the fruits and veggies and smaller portions. working out 3-5 days a week (5 days with t-25 but otherwise it was 3 days a week) .

Not the usual progress pictures you’d expect but I promise this ends on a cheerful note :) 

I had lost about 115 pounds nearly 5 years ago and I was pretty good at keeping the extra pounds off but then life happened and I gained 40 lbs back (15 of those in the last year thanks to the pandemic). 

Quite frankly I was beating myself up over it up until recently, wondering how did I let myself get back here again but something in me finally sparked and I’m back on the weight loss train again. If I was able to lose over one hundred pounds before I can totally get these 40 pounds off again! So I downloaded MFP, I’m tracking everything closely and not only I’ve already lost 2 pounds but I’m starting to feel less bloated. It’s all so encouraging. 

Sure it kinda sucks I have to do this again but that’s life for ya. It’s not all linear. As long as you remember to get back up and try again, you’re already a winner. Knowing I’ve succeeded before and trusting the calorie deficit gives me so much confidence I’ll get back to where I was 5 years ago. Every day I stay on track is a day closer I get to my goal and that alone is a victory in itself.

0,"Possible trigger warning: mentions of eating disorders

I'm mostly writing this out as a kind of journal entry, but I'm very open to advice or comments!

So I'm a 5 ft, 28 year old woman currently weighing 227 lbs. I, like many people in this sub, have struggled with my weight since I was a child. I've tried just about everything and have almost never had any success except for one time when I was ~21. I've been diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), depression, and OCD. I have also been diagnosed with BED (Binge Eating Disorder), and nearly diagnosed with Anorexia. The near diagnosis of Anorexia stemmed from losing 40 lbs in 3 months when I was ~21. I went from ~220 lbs to ~180 lbs, I hit a plateau and saw my primary to see what I could do to break through it. Initially she complimented my weight loss, but upon hearing about how quickly I lost the weight, how strict I was being, and how triggered my OCD was, she said I was in danger of becoming anorexic. She decided not to officially diagnosis me though for some reason. This shock coupled with the plateau, caused me to crash hard and I have not been able to stay on track for more than a month ever since.

I want so badly to lose weight and be healthy. Losing the weight means the possibility of lessening chronic pain I've had since I was 12 years old (no guarantee as the pain is not weight related, but weight loss *could* help ease the pain). Despite the want, I'm terrified. I don't want to become obsessed again. I started out with 1200 calories/day, but quickly dropped down to 900/day. I was eating half a cup of cereal and milk for breakfasts, a cup of soup or a small salad for lunches, and tiny portions of whatever my parents had made for dinner. I refused to eat anything I didn't know the nutritional info on. I was weighing myself multiple times a day, especially in the morning before and after using the bathroom. My mom ended up hiding the bathroom scale on me and only letting me use it once a week. I was basically hibernating during those 3 months. I slept nearly all day and night and only woke up to use the bathroom and eat. 

I wish I could find some middle ground, but I've tried repeatedly to have some kind of willpower and use moderation but I simply cannot do it. I guess I'm just an all or nothing kind of person. I also have terrible, terrible cravings. If I'm craving something, I have obsessive thoughts about it. I can't stop thinking about it until I have it. I hate to say it, but I even kind of get depressed when I dwell on my cravings. I'm also an incredibly picky eater, so finding healthy things that I **do** like is a bit of a challenge.

On the bright side, now that I live alone, if I don't buy it, I don't have it. I do my best during my weekly grocery shop to not buy junk food. I'm entirely too lazy to drive to the store for one package of Oreos, and I'm far too cheap to pay for delivery. I haven't drank soda (diet, thanks to growing up with a diabetic mom, I'm used to diet and sugar free things) regularly in years, I don't like coffee, I don't cook meat often (just seems like a lot of work for one person), and I recently made the change to almond milk. I do have a pretty active little dog and we go for 20-40 minute walks (time depending on my pain level and weather) 3-4 times a day. I've made some small changes over the years which is nice, but every time I really try to be healthier and still have ""bad"" food in moderation, I end up going off the rails quickly, crashing, and restarting.

I'm so tired of this rinse and repeat cycle I'm in. Maybe it's worth letting the OCD take over and becoming obsessed again, as long as I'm aware of it? Sometimes I just wish I had no choices and could only eat what someone chose for me. Maybe surgery is worth looking into? I don't know. For those wondering, yes, throughout the years I have seen many nutritionists, dieticians, my mom's diabetes doctor (I'm not pre-diabetic but my mom thought she might have some insight), my primary, psychiatrists, and therapists. I've also been a part of a few weight loss support groups as well as a chronic pain support group. Nothing sticks with me for long.

I feel like my thoughts and feelings are a little bit more in order after writing this. I'm probably gonna delete it in a few hours but it was helpful to get it out.

so i am 19, 5'7"", and about 235 pounds, and according to [this calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/), my tdee is 2,900 for my current exercise level, which is moderate (hard cardio for 40 minutes 4 times a week). subtracting 500 calories for a deficit leaves me at 2,400. this still feels WAY too high. i started ADHD medication that has made my appetite decrease, and if i eat around 1,800 for the day i feel really full and i have trouble imagining eating more for the day. i also realize that if i don't eat enough/rest enough it will only be damaging in the long run. having pcos makes this equation more difficult as there's a lot of conflicting information on whether it impacts BMR or not. 

since my weight has fluctuated so much i'm honestly also just scared of intentionally eating 2,400 calories for the day even if i'm more active than i've ever been and i put in good work at the gym. i just have trouble trusting this number and trusting the process in general. if anyone has been in this spot before and has any advice, it would be GREATLY appreciated.",tdee feels too high,"tdee feels too high hi all, i'm a 19 year old female and *kind of* starting my weight loss journey. i say kind of because i've yoyo-ed between periods of weight loss and weight gain since i was 12, with my highest weight being 275 at 13 and my lowest weight being about 210 at 16. a lot of this was due to disordered eating and easier weight gain due to pcos, going between periods of bingeing and self starvation with no consistent exercise. i just moved to college and have regular access to a gym for the first time and am trying to take full advantage of it, and i don't keep food in my room (other than a few snacks) to control bingeing and only get food from the dining hall which has pretty healthy options.

hey everyone! I'm new to this subreddit, but I've been using the LoseIt! calorie tracker app on and off since I was in sixth grade (I'm 22 now, so 12.5 years. I was obese as a kid). 
I'm about halfway through a 5day a week strongman/muscle building lifting plan, full body 4 days a week, upper body on the 5th. My appetite has SKYROCKETED and I'm honestly amazed I managed to maintain a tight 133 for the first three weeks. Since Valentine's Day, though, my weight has jumped up to 135. And while I know gaining weight is expected, given I genuinely want to increase strength on this plan, I'm seriously worried for the last six weeks of it. I came home from college last March and lost ~7 lbs pretty easily (yeah our dining hall food is NOT easy to lose weight on, and I valued comfort foods a little too much). I'm worried I'm going to go back to my pre covid weight (~140) instead of lose these last 5 lbs. I've wanted to weigh 130 for four years now, and I'm so close I can taste it. 
I guess I wanted to introduce myself, and let some stuff off my chest, and see if you guys had  tips on losing the last little bit. I've gotten my maintenance calories to 2200 (more if i accidentally eat low carb but that's just bc water weight) so I sometimes feel very sad on 1800 as a slight deficit. I know it's very very doable, so I've been feeling discouraged I can't even stick to that.
Thanks so much in advance❤️

hey everyone! I'm new to this subreddit, but I've been using the LoseIt! calorie tracker app on and off since I was in sixth grade (I'm 22 now, so 12.5 years. I was obese as a kid). 
I'm about halfway through a 5day a week strongman/muscle building lifting plan, full body 4 days a week, upper body on the 5th. My appetite has SKYROCKETED and I'm honestly amazed I managed to maintain a tight 133 for the first three weeks. Since Valentine's Day, though, my weight has jumped up to 135. And while I know gaining weight is expected, given I genuinely want to increase strength on this plan, I'm seriously worried for the last six weeks of it. I came home from college last March and lost ~7 lbs pretty easily (yeah our dining hall food is NOT easy to lose weight on, and I valued comfort foods a little too much). I'm worried I'm going to go back to my pre covid weight (~140) instead of lose these last 5 lbs. I've wanted to weigh 130 for four years now, and I'm so close I can taste it. 
I guess I wanted to introduce myself, and let some stuff off my chest, and see if you guys had  tips on losing the last little bit. I've gotten my maintenance calories to 2200 (more if i accidentally eat low carb but that's just bc water weight) so I sometimes feel very sad on 1800 as a slight deficit. I know it's very very doable, so I've been feeling discouraged I can't even stick to that.
Thanks so much in advance❤️
(Edit: I drink at least 128oz a day of water, but maybe switching some of it for seltzer (I have a soda stream!) may help? bc carbonation is more filling)"
0,"So I downloaded noom today on a trial because I keep hearing good things. Went through all the questions and got my calorie count for the day...it's only 1200? For reference I'm a 30 year old female, 5'10"" and I currently weigh between 173-176 with fluctuations. I workout at least 3-4 times a week for about 30-40 minutes a day and it's a mix of weight lifting and HITT usually depending on the day. I have a sedentary desk job and try and walk about 45-60 minutes a day but I don't always get it in.

Am I crazy or is 1200 way too low?!? I want to be around 145lbs if possible and finally feel good in my body (numbers arent a big deal if I can build muscle to get to a place I feel confident so 145 is a number goal but I won't be sad if I don't reach that as long as I feel confident in my body). Most of my weight I carry around my mid section everywhere else is honestly pretty lean.

I’ve been struggling with my weight practically my whole life. I’ve never been classified as morbidly obese, I also have a lot of muscle mass so I don’t look like I ,,have” to lose 20 kilos. However, lately I’ve been feeling really heavy, which is sad since im only 21 years old. I decided it’s time to finally lose that excess weight I have an start eating healthy. I’m not looking for a quick, one week diet to, but rather a change in lifestyle. When reading a post on this topic I ran across a TDEE calculator and decided to try it to. By its calculations I should be consuming around 1.800 calories in order to lose weight.

Hi all,

It's been a weird week for me. Since 24th Jan 2021 (when I hit my lowest weight in my weight loss journey) when I got to 285lbs (started at 314lbs) I have lost no weight at all. instead I have gained, lost, gained, lost, gained, lost....and so on forth. I have been BATTLING with myself to keep to my diet but I keep on losing to my other self. the less disciplined self, the less caring self, the less healthy less, the greedy self, the self who is so scared to lose weight so much so that she sabotages herself, self.

since Jan 24th I have basically been binging, making myself sick, tasting then spitting out food and overeating....it feels so shameful to write this all out. I feel ashamed. but I also feel kinda relieved...? I feel relieved I can admit these things, I can recognise they are wrong and I realise this want within myself to want to change them too. 

so since jan 24th I have basically been ruining all the progress I made then losing weight and repeat. but this week was a lil different.

I posted a week ago about a really bad period which also made me gain a ton (like 10lbs almost) of weight....this week I resolved to not be hard on myself (my hormones are messed up, im on week 3 of my period and in process of getting this checked out now because enough is enough). I have been walking a ton more, eating more balanced, did not make myself vomit even when I kept thinking about it, I did spit out some chocolate once but once I did I decided to just get rid of the chocolate all together, and I have been successfully drinking a ton of water daily. I have been monitoring my weight everyday and it is going down, I know a lot of this water weight from my period but it is still satisfying nevertheless.

my period is making me want to eat sooo much more, so I am (not by a huge margin,I am still in a deficit). right now my period is really messed up and it is messing up my eating/hunger too but instead of dwelling over it and becoming depressed like I have been the previous 2 weeks ive just decided to eat and then quite literally walk it off. I am still in a deficit. today I went a 1000 calories over (past deficit) and I really wanted to make myself sick but I decided I would instead go on a loooooong walk/mini hike tomorrow to burn it off and start afresh (again). 

im not perfect and ive stopped trying to be. I'm tired guys.

weight loss is one of the hardest things I think I have ever tried to do. I keep failing myself but now instead of concentrating on the fails I want to focus on the picking myself back up and doing better for myself. I literally prayed to God before posting this to help me keep in a calorie deficit tomorrow and to help my balance out my over eating today.... (I feel like im in this same constant mistake making loop)

I don't know what exactly I expect in a response here...I know a lot of this is self-destructive behaviour and points to a lot of issues with food...I have had therapy before but I keep making the same mistakes and I kinda don't know what to do to stop doing it. so I guess im sharing here to just get it off my chest. I know the mistakes I am making and how to avoid them/fix them but there is SOMETHING inside me which doesn't allow me to. is it the fear? I have a fear that ill loose weight and still won't love my physical self or still won't find love or happiness... I don't know. but I do know I am tired. I sooooo tired of this. I want progress, not negative and useless repetition.

I have to talk to my dietician on Monday and I am SCARED. I am DREADING it cos I feel emabarressed and ashamed to admit all the above. I was going to lie, quite honestly. but what good will that do? im scared to tell her all this. I am really scared, ashamed and embarrassed of myself. but at this point I feel like I almost deserve to have that feeling after how I treat myself. I feel so hopeless sometimes!

tl;dr: anyway, if you made it this far, I am tired of repeating the same stupid mistakes and I wish I had a magic potion to fix myself and my weight-related problems. I just don't know how to find that inner discipline. :(",I'm making some progress...but I'm also making no progress,"I'm making some progress...but I'm also making no progress tl;dr below

I would love to keep this going. But will it screw me over in a month if I plateau? I don’t know if I could maintain 1200 calories a day, I might start binging again.

I don’t even have this feeling again of being incredibly motivated but I have felt myself slipping into old bad habits harder than before. Eating candy, drinking soda, etc. I feel like I eat like I’m still 15 sometimes and the realization of getting older and weight loss becoming harder has mentally sent me to a place where I feel this is obviously something I need to do. I don’t want to be this weight, I shouldn’t be this weight, and it feels more and more unhealthy by the day.

For some context: I’ve always been a “big guy” and of course have used that as an excuse for myself. More than that, I’ve always been “athletic” even for my build. I played a lot of sports and even on my last stint of working out, I was able to do about 25 push-ups at 385lbs which I know isn’t necessarily ordinary so I have used that excuse as a reason to stay unhealthy. Here’s the thing; I like working out. I like feeling strong. I like getting stronger. I like how I feel when I eat healthier. I like how I feel when I drink an appropriate amount of water throughout the day. But all of this feels so hard when I’ve been treating my body like trash for so long. I want to change but man do I feel hopeless and like it’ll never be enough. It always feels like I’ll be back at square one.  I have the tools, I just never use them. I know how to count calories, how to use my TDEE, how to form a workout plan that I can sustain. I feel like I just lack the discipline and willpower to stay committed. I know it may never come and I might be better off just doing it because that just might be the best thing for me.

So this is me, taking my next step, and looking to take many more. Please if you have any advice or words of encouragement I could really use them right now. Thank you so much and I hope to become a more active member in this wonderful community."

I just want to warn that I will be bringing up details of an ED that I developed during my weight loss journey. My main purpose of posting this is to ask for help and advice on what to do now.

I have posted on this sub before about how I was struggling to cope with my body changing and accepting that I am no longer as big as I was. I started my journey at 250lbs and these days I have been swinging between 165lbs-170lbs (about 5 months). I reached the 160s quickly because I started heavy restriction when I got stuck at 175lbs. During the restriction I also increased my daily steps dramatically. To give an idea of my day: consuming under 1000 cal, burning 80% of it by walking. I am 5'6 F in my early 20s.

This has obviously brought me to where I am now. Struggling to make any progress, mental health declining, afraid of food, and worried about gaining too much weight trying to fix my metabolism.

I don't know where to go from here. If anyone has reassuring words or advice to provide, I will listen. I just want to get back on track and feel good again.",I Hurt My Relationship With Food,"I Hurt My Relationship With Food Hello everyone

So I was feeling pretty discouraged because my weight loss has been pretty slow in general mostly because I just can’t do the high deficit thing anymore. I don’t know, I’m just tired of being hungry, demonizing food, getting obsessive. So my only goal now is to eat below 1700 and even then I probably have a day a week I go over, but I usually average out between 1400-1600 cals a day per week. And yes and you can see, I lose a few pounds a month. 

I’ve been working out just to be able to eat more food and get some strength because I’m also tired of needing people to help me carry everything. I’ve been doing some Beachbody programs (Barre Blend and now I’m on LIIFT4). I would do a 5k on one or two of the off days just because I really like running. 

Anyways, so lots of NSV like building a better relationship with food, getting buff, better balance, and more endurance. But sometimes instead of seeing the 10 lbs I’ve lost, I just feel the 25-35 lbs weighing down on me. I don’t know why, but I just felt heavy this week. It messed up my run Wednesday because all I could think of is “you have to drag this fat body up the hill with you.” Like whoa, I thought we were past that? Where did that come from? 

But today, I was dancing to some music I discovered (Mother by Danzig if you’re interested) and I felt kind of hot! Like I was checking myself out and finally like it clicked. I have been doing measurements, but I was only focusing on how my boobs and ass shrunk. But my stomach is flatter. Still some fat there, but it doesn’t just hang out anymore. And I can get low! Like reeeeal low. A lot more flexible too. 

It was a good feeling and a nice reminder that I am doing the right thing and making the right changes. It might be slow, but the key is to find those good moments on the way down. Sorry for the hokey moral, but I feel like I can never end a post without an upside 👍",This Week Wasn’t Going Well Until I Thought I Looked Hot,"This Week Wasn’t Going Well Until I Thought I Looked Hot I’m currently about 145 lbs and started at 155 in early December.

0,"Hey folks. 

I had an ED a few years ago. Dropped from a BMI of 20 to about 16 (I guess 120 lbs —&gt; 80 lbs) and then gained it back in a long, tearful, gruelling process.

My life was in shambles when my ED started. As my life resolved, I had more time to fix my ED and focus on the things and people I loved: school, my friends, my family (after we sorted out some issues), running, art, etc. In fact, I achieved my dream of getting into med school at 20!

And now I have my ED mostly under wraps. I live alone so there’s a lot of liberty with how I eat (i.e. meal times and no one can scold me for missing meals etc.)

I’ve recently been a little dissatisfied with my body. Just wanting to trim a little here and there. So I got MyFitnessPal again.

It made me so sad. And so guilty. And I realized I eat way more than I thought I did.

0,"I've been with my boyfriend for five years. I developed an eating disorder early on in our relationship and he picked up on my bad habits. Ultimately I gained around 50-60lbs and he gained around 150lbs.

However, he doesn't seem to be losing at all really. I try to make him more filling lower calorie meals. Obviously it is not good enough though.

I'm at the point of feeling resentful towards him for not taking this seriously, especially when he knows our relationship is at stake.

Hi all! I just found out that you can link your DNA Report (Ancestry, 23andMe, etc) to LoseIt and it can give you recommendations based on your genetic traits. How accurate is this? Can you really tell if someone should be eating more high carb/low fat vs. high fat/low carb just based on their genes? LoseIt recommends 15-25% fat calories and 55-65% carb calories for my ratios based on DNA traits.

0,"I needed to lose 20 pounds and started on January 1 with a plan that I’ve found remarkably easy, I thought I would share in case it helps others. So far I’ve lost 16 pounds so will hit my goal in the next few weeks.  

- I start the day with 2 low calorie protein shakes (200 calories in total with 3 pints of water), makes me feel full till 10am when I eat breakfast. 

- Breakfast is porridge oats which keeps me going till 1pm, coming in around 150 calories as I have a small portion with water

- Lunch is a soup, a whole meal thin with butter and one square of dark chocolate,  coming around 400 calories 

- I walk for 60 minutes as quickly as I can in the afternoon at some point, I get out of breath, my Apple Watch says I’m doing about 50 mins of exercise out of my total 60 mins walking, I have 2 pints of water when I get back 

- In the afternoon at some point I eat kefir as a snack which is good for my gut, I also have 2 pints of water and feel full (around 150 calories)

- I eat dinner around 6pm and it’s made up of a big bag of kale or similar with a spicy sauce, jalapeños, peppers and what ever else looks like flavour, and I mix in some chopped small amounts chicken, fish or nut roast with the kale in a wok, so I have a huge portion, covers the whole plate of spicy, tasty greens with 2 pints of water with 1 square of dark chocolate (this is around 400 calories)

- I gave up alcohol and found a low calorie, non alcohol beer I liked. Took me a while but I found Brooklyn which I really like and is less than 80 calories. 

- I do 30 mins of weights every other evening while watching the tv. I have a fold up weight bench and dumbbells, and I do a simple routine for my shoulders, chest, thighs and arms. Sorry I know I’m focusing on my mirror muscles! 

- Before bed I have a 1 scoop (100 calorie protein shake) 

So I eat about 1500 to 1700 calories per day, the walking burns around 300 calories and the weights about the same. My fitness pal and my watch tells I’m in deficit by between 400 and 700 calories per day. 

All the food is easy and quick to prepare, available at my local store (which I walk to every day to help with my steps), and at no point do I ever feel hungry. Clearly the water really helps with feeling full. 

Downsides 
1. I wake up to pee in the night! 
2. I have had some constipation so have added a syrup of figs into my morning routine

Upsides 
1. I’m nearly 50 and feel great, I’ve had to buy some new trousers and enjoy wearing clothes again.

I am a man who's weight fluctuates a lot... Typically my cycle goes..

1. Go from about 165lbs to 180lbs
2. Do keto for 45 days
3. Back to 165lbs
4. Repeat

This has happened about 3 times; this time I weighed myself and I was 195lbs and realized that my usual approach was not ideal, and I'd like to keep it off.

I don't have the commitment to stick to a schedule, or a particular diet, I also hate cooking and my job/hobbies both involve me sitting at a desk.

So, this time I bought a Fitbit (charge 4), paid for premium and Fitbit Coach, and also paid for MyFitnessPal. 

My new routine is simply:

- Calorie goal of 1450 (Macros below, but I dont follow these strictly at all)
 - Carbs: 181g
 - Fat: 48g
 - Protein: 73g
- I do a 10 minute daily workout on Fitbit Coach. It's a mixture between bodyweight exercises, some cardio, and a sprinkling of yoga.
- I run twice a week, not much, because I am ridiculously out of shape.

0,"TL;DR Thanks to OMAD I’ve taken control of my hunger/cravings and I can keep myself from eating a whole pizza in one sitting. 

I love pizza. Lemme say that again. I LOVE pizza. It’s my favorite freakin food. And, once COVID hit, I was stuck in my house with a bunch of time on my hands and some savings left over (workplace closed cause of COVID and I was out of a job). I ate quite a few deep-dish/pan crust/extra cheese pizzas from Domino’s all by myself, in my room, in between my many hours of sedentary video game playing. And maybe I’d also order a multi-serving side of alfredo pasta too. Oh and some of those breaded chicken bites they got. Oh and I never forget the ranch dip. I went wild. And it was great for the first few months. COVID hit right in the middle of my final semester at college, and boy was I burnt out. I needed a break and the stay at home orders felt like a godsend! Just eating tasty fast food (like pizza) and playing videogames, all day long. 

Until I clocked in at 260 lbs a month ago (I’m a 5’11” male). In 2018, when I was in the best shape and lowest weight of my life, I was at a muscular 170 lbs. That means, in 3 years, I have come to be 10 lbs short of being 100 lbs heavier than I was when I was in control of my weight and my health. 

Well, I’ve been doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) for maybe 2 weeks now? eating at noon everyday. (That’s following several failed attempts of getting myself back on track with my weight.) And it SUCKED at first. Mad cravings towards the night, lots of glasses of water to combat said cravings. A cheat day somewhere in between. But I’ve been doing it. And slowly the evening cravings have gotten less intense. AND, I’m not binging on food for the one meal I do get to eat. 

That’s where the pizza comes in. Finally ordered some Domino’s for the first time in forever. Guess what I got? Pan crust pepperoni and cheese pizza. Side of alfredo pasta. Ate all the pasta, it was only 600 cals. But the pizza.... man oh man what a good pizza. I can’t just let this all sit in the box. Just one more slice.......

NOPE. Ate 3 slices, closed the box, and put it in the fridge! That’s my meal for the day! And still under my TDEE calorie count. I’m honestly amazed and PROUD of myself for doing it. So many failures have lead to this, this simple decision that I consider to be a huge, crazy important victory for me. And best part of it all, I still got to eat the rest of the pizza. Ate the last few slices today, again within my calories. I just wanted to share this with y’all out of a combination of pride/excitement and also hoping that maybe in sharing my personal weight loss related trials and tribulations, someone who needs some inspiration can get it.

Last November, I decided to take about a month and a half to maintain. I was burnt out on weight loss, and the 500 calorie deficit was starting to really get to me. In January, I went back to a calorie deficit, this time only 250, with the expectation that I would lose weight again, but that it would slooow.

And is has been slow. So freaking slow. 0.5 lbs per week is agonizingly slow, and sometimes a month will go by and the number won't change. It can be so discouraging.

But you know what has changed in this time? My measurements.

I took my measurements in December, when I was maintaining, because I have shrunk out of all of my clothing and, for the holidays, decided to treat myself to a nice, wool skirt. I had a 36"" waist.

I have a lot of injuries, and I mostly get exercise in two ways: walking and belly dancing. In these last few months of eating at a deficit, I started being more consistent, especially in my dancing. It's less about burning calories, though I am certainly happy with the extra food for the day-- dancing just feels good, and you can stop whenever anything starts to hurt in a bad way.

Last week, out of sheer frustration with the number on the scale and the desperate hope that all this work and deficit eating had gotten me somewhere, I decided to take my measurements, and GUYS.

&amp;#x200B;

**3 inches off my waist.**

**1 inch off each of my thighs.**

**.25 inches off my neck.**

**.25 inches off one of my arms, .5 off the other.**

**2 inches off my underbust. That means my bra is down a full band size.**

&amp;#x200B;

Guys. I didn't believe it. Seriously, I thought there was something wrong. Maybe I was really dehydrated? So I checked again the next day, and it was the same.

I checked again yesterday. .25 off the second arm, so they both lost .5 inches.

My scale has basically not moved in the last four months, but my measurements sure have. Weight is not the only metric.

All of this to say: PLEASE take your measurements. It seriously saved my mental game, and made me feel so encouraged about continuing the deficit.","I lost no weight for three months, but my waist lost 3 inches","I lost no weight for three months, but my waist lost 3 inches 27F 5'4-5"" SW 218 CW 167 GW 155 UGW???

Weigh in daily, enter in Libra &amp; report here even if I don’t like it: 232.6 this morning, 231.1 lbs trend weight. Heeeey guess who has a uterus in full-fledged violent coup? This lady. 

Stay within calorie range (1800): Doing okay here. More maintenance days than I like if I’m going to keep up the 3-4 pounds down a month but still better than a previous version of myself. 2/2 days. 

Exercise 5 days a week: 30-minute brisk walk at lunch &amp; 35 minutes vigorous stationary bike. 4/4 days.  

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, nonfood rewards): Have been doing some self-inventory about where I feel like I am in life &amp; what I want next. And I’ve decided whenever I get some sweet tax return money (don’t get me started on how the US handles taxes kids), I’m joining the quarantine starting trend &amp; getting a Switch. My buddies play Animal Crossing &amp; since I still can’t see much of them, I will take going to their islands &amp; dropping off ugly outfits. 

Try a new recipe once a week: Romanesco, roasted. New veggie, new recipe, I say it counts even though it tasted like a fun broccoli cauliflower love child. 1/4 weeks.   

Express mindfulness and or gratitude: Today I’m grateful for the internet &amp; easy access to books, blogs &amp; human’s encouraging other humans to never feel guilty for being human.

I am almost 40 lbs down now, which means my clothes are getting loose. 

I am not at goal weight yet so I can’t invest in a ton of new stuff but I do have to be, uh, clothed 😂 so I bought some new stuff.

But as I went to put said new stuff in my closet (it’s an Ikea thing so just a lot of drawers, no hangers) it hit me.

my closet was a disaster area.

Not because it was a gross mess (it was!) but because of the way it felt. Like a black hole of despair, source of sad feelings, vibe of profound sadness. The thing I opened every day and hated.

I stood there looking at these heaps of wrinkled, some even stained, stretched out “fat” clothes. All of it shoved into drawers. Hate clothes.

This closet clearly belonged to a person who was used to hiding so “why did it matter what she looked like.” These were the clothes of a person who hated getting dressed in the morning. 

(I know this is not always the case but it was for me. The weight gain had made me stop caring.)

Well, I went crazy 😝 

I dumped every single thing on the floor. After dusting the crap out of the shelves (which were gross and dirty) I tore through the piles. I filled an entire trash bag with clothes to throw out and another TWO bags with clothes to donate.

And then finally I folded &amp; placed my few new things into the pristine, empty wooden drawers. 

I stepped back, and felt the most profound weight lifting away.

My next target was to get to the 10kg mark. on my 13th week I flew past it. I weighed in at 66.2kg! I currently have another 9kg's I'd like to lose, and I'm staying strong.   
I know it's cliché to say but...... If i can do it, anyone can. Last November I felt awful about myself. I hated looking in the mirror and now it's not so painful.

0,"Food addiction isn’t what you think it is in the traditional sense of addiction, or maybe it is, I don’t know. Here are a few examples of what it looks like: 

-wrappers upon wrappers surround your bedside tables of food you know you shouldn’t be eating, but simply could not stop yourself. I ate a FORTY TWO PACK box of fruit gushers in a little over a week. 

-if it’s at my disposal or within reach, I will eat it. I quite literally cannot keep poor food choices in my home, or I will binge eat it until it’s gone so that I don’t have to prolong the cycle of shame eating for any longer than it needs to be. (Read above) 

-I told old roommates and my partner, if they have a snack, to store it up high so that I cannot reach it and eat it. 

-it looks like staying up late until your partner falls asleep so that you can secretly eat snacks because you feel he might pass judgment (but he likely doesn’t even notice)

-it’s eating a tub of ice cream you and your partner were supposed to share, and since you ate the first half of it... instead of saving it, you waited until they slept so that you could sneak in your bedroom and finish it off, despite knowing how selfish it is. Despite knowing it would likely upset your partner. Having that sweet dopamine kick won over anything else, and it’s pathetic. 

I feel as though I have relapsed. As though I am completely out of control, as though I am weak and nothing more than a person who has absolutely no will power. It’s a cycle of knowing you can be better, but believing otherwise about yourself. It’s almost self abuse, I over eat to simultaneously feel happiness and also punish myself for lacking impulse control. 

Be kind to fat folk, we are not lazy, we are mentally ill.

-it looks like staying up late until your partner falls asleep so that you can secretly eat snacks because you feel he might pass judgment (but he likely doesn’t even notice)

-it’s eating a tub of ice cream you and your partner were supposed to share, and since you ate the first half of it... instead of saving it, you waited until they slept so that you could sneak in your bedroom and finish it off, despite knowing how selfish it is. Despite knowing it would likely upset your partner. Having that sweet dopamine kick won over anything else, and it’s pathetic. 

I feel as though I have relapsed. As though I am completely out of control, as though I am weak and nothing more than a person who has absolutely no will power. It’s a cycle of knowing you can be better, but believing otherwise about yourself. It’s almost self abuse, I over eat to simultaneously feel happiness and also punish myself for lacking impulse control. 

Be kind to fat folk, we are not lazy, we are mentally ill. 

Weight loss journeys are not linear, and I am struggling today.

0,"26F here about 2 months into my journey but 30 days on serious mode. I gained a lot of weight in college/grad school... went from about 170 lbs to 270 by the time I got my graduate degree. Back in 2018 I decided to put in work through the gym and stop eating out so much and I lost 40 lbs over a few months but stalled around 230 lbs. Recently I’ve had a lot of stressful events and around the holidays went up to 242 lbs. I just said enough is enough, I need to get serious about this and make some changes. I can’t live like this, unhealthy and hating myself. 

All throughout January I made efforts to move more and eat less but I didn’t track calories. I lost about 3 lbs but had some weak moments and gained the 3 lbs back before the end of the month. February rolled around and I downloaded my fitness pal and started getting serious. I’ve logged every bite of food or drink since then, aiming for around 1700 cals a day, and I’m down 9.2 lbs. I know this rate of loss won’t continue but I’m going to keep going with this deficit. I also have tried to add 30 minute walks or exercise to my day 5 times a week and that helps. 

For the first time I feel like I’m making REAL sustainable changes. I eat what I want, including pizza, starbucks, McDonald’s, dessert, etc. I just make sure it fits into my deficit. I don’t feel like I’m restricting myself and I just generally feel great and healthy. 

I was so scared of counting calories and becoming obsessed with numbers and food, but honestly since I started tracking I think about weight loss way LESS. I don’t have to worry because I know I will continue to lose weight as long as I continue to be in a deficit.

0,"Hey everybody! I’m so happy to announce that I finally reached 200lbs from my starting point of 260 back in August. 

Some info on my journey. I’m 17M, and in August I weighed &gt;260lbs, and decided I needed to start working on myself after my brother got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and was on insulin at 21 years old. This terrified me and pushed me into changing my life so I could hopefully avoid it. I started off with just walking a lot, 5 miles a day outside. In September I found this sub, learned about CICO, and started calorie counting. I’m eating ~1700-1800 calories a day. Things went extremely well, my parents are super supportive of me, and my dad is using the LoseIt app as well, and helps make and shares the food when he makes dinner. Anytime throughout these past few months I felt close to giving up, I started going through this sub. Seeing everyone’s accomplishments, struggles, questions, answers really motivated me and kept my mind focused on completing my goals. And finally today, I reached exactly 200lbs! My ultimate goal is 185 and then to start working out and gain muscle.

Some NSV I’ve noticed: My Jean waist size went from a 42 to a 34 inch, my shirt size went from XXL to L, my skin is clearer, my confidence is finally not terrible and I feel comfortable going outside in t-shirts, I can walk a lot more than I used to be able to, snowboarding is a heck a lot more fun now and I don’t get tired right away, and I sleep WAY better. I even had to retake my senior pictures because I looked so much different than I did in August!

0,"Ok so I've been doing this whole ""losing weight"" stuff for about 6 months now and have lost a decent 60 lbs and from what I've been seeing everywhere it seems I'm doing one thing wrong and it's not counting calories, I don't got a weight for my food, I don't measure stuff in a cup 24/7, I don't weight my poop, etc.

I'll go into the kitchen, serve myself a bowl of cereal, looks like a cup and a half of 180 calories, make it 200, milk cup serving is 160, it looks like 180, there I went from a 340 calorie meal to a 380 calories, so this throughout the day and depending on how far you go (I always assume anything 170 or higher is 200) you ""added"" an extr 100-400 calories to your deficit, and when I say ""added"" I mean corrected, generally speaking when people measure and weight stuff they get better results cause the results show true colors, if you're ironically too lazy to do that like me then you end up with this weird method where you just round out that 460 calories burger to 500 and ""burn"" an extra 40 calories",The trick to NOT counting calories,"The trick to NOT counting calories Ok so I've been doing this whole ""losing weight"" stuff for about 6 months now and have lost a decent 60 lbs and from what I've been seeing everywhere it seems I'm doing one thing wrong and it's not counting calories, I don't got a weight for my food, I don't measure stuff in a cup 24/7, I don't weight my poop, etc.

My Gf just started a proper weight training program and caloric deficit which has weekly check ins through the app. Before this she was on a low carb diet for about 4 months which was very restricted.
Anyway after these last few check ins on the new diet her weight isn’t going anywhere and she gets so disheartened and I’m not sure how to help other them telling her to just be patient and keep going. I’m on the same diet and have lost 6kg in 8 weeks, her prior diet we looked at what her calories roughly were and it was under 1000. So I’ve read that her body could be adjusting to her new calories which are 2,400cal because she under ate for so long?

Anyway after these last few check ins on the new diet her weight isn’t going anywhere and she gets so disheartened and I’m not sure how to help other them telling her to just be patient and keep going. I’m on the same diet and have lost 6kg in 8 weeks, her prior diet we looked at what her calories roughly were and it was under 1000. So I’ve read that her body could be adjusting to her new calories which are 2,400cal because she under ate for so long?

Any advice would be welcome, just trying to reassure her that her diet will work."
0,"I’m currently just doing CICO and doing really good exercises and I can definitely see good progress since I’ve started in the first week of January. 

My current total calorie intake for weight loss is a bit low(nothing to be alarmed about as it’s safe and not restrictive), and my estimated total daily intake to maintain my goal weight will be around 2,000-2,100 calories if I continue exercising(which I plan to do since I love being active). 
I’m lucky that I won’t have to lose too much weight to get my goal as I’ll have to lose around 40lbs or 18kg.

I figure once I reach the goal the most logical thing to do is to slowly increase my calorie intake until I get to the maintenance intake so that my body doesn’t freak out. But I’ll admit, I don’t know what to do in order to successfully move my calorie intake up to maintain since I have a large fear of regaining since I yo-yo dieting for multiple years and typically gained back due to my previous binge and restrict cycles.

0,"Why do I get RAVENOUS every time I lose 10 pounds?

This baffles me. I’ve lost 48 pounds from my highest weight. 28 of that has been since the end of October.

I’ve lost a steady pound and a half a week on average.

Every time I hit another 10 pounds down I get INSANELY hungry. It’s like an insatiable hunger that doesn’t go away.

It happened when I went from 238 to 228 and now that I’ve hit 218 it’s happening again. 

I don’t gain anything from it because I’m not going over my maintenance calories.

I don’t mind it but it seriously stalls my progress by two or three weeks when it happens.

0,"Please help. I am so confused at this point. 

I know that I want to take in the maximum nutrients my body needs, but with the minimum of energy (calories) it needs. Because fat is just energy, and we take in too few nutrients but too much energy which then is saved by the body as fat. 

My biggest problem is, I don’t know what eat every day.

Today's topic: **Is it worth it?**

A few days ago I saw a post asking if the weight loss was worth it. ""Do people treat you better? Do you feel better? Do you find it easier to meet people?"" So that started me thinking about what exactly made my journey ""worth it"" for me. 

Of course it was worth it from a health perspective. I will be going in for my annual physical in a couple of weeks and we'll see what my doctor thinks. I got off CPAP, maybe I can get off my blood pressure meds this year.

I'm also way more fit than I have ever been in my adult life thanks to being more regularly active. Even though I have not been running much this month, I have been walking 7500-10000 steps most days and keeping up with the NHS Strength and Flex routine that has been providing a reasonable alternative to running that should actually help me when I start running again.

At the core though it boils down to a single simple thing for me now. Self confidence. I know that I am capable of doing something most people find quite elusive: Losing a very significant amount of weight and keeping it off for longer than a year. I am in control of my weight. If I overeat, it's no one else's fault. All mine. If my eating habits lead to weight gain over time, it's my fault for not adjusting my intake to whatever my current activity levels may be.

I know well the simple knob I need to adjust so that I can stay at my current weight level. Eating just a little bit less if I want my weight to trend downwards. For the past 90 days or so I've been on a slight upwards trend. Happy Scale shows my trend weight going up at about 2 lbs/90 days so 8 lbs a year, ~100 kcal/day over maintenance at ~155. As the weather improves, and I can resume running regularly, I expect that trend will reverse. But I also know that don't need to really change much until I look at the March/April/May trend. Even if I gain another 2 lbs by June, my trend weight will be at the middle of my 10 lb maintenance range.

Anyhow, that self confidence is what drives a lot of the other non-medical benefits of keeping the weight off. Even though we're not in a current pandemic situation that allows for much in the way of social interaction, presenting myself with more confidence makes it easier to strike up random conversations and makes it easier for others to treat you well and meeting new friends or potential romantic partners.

0,"I am F/31/5'4"". I currently weigh 177 pounds. In Feb 2019, I was over 200 pounds, and I started my weight loss journey. It wasnt the first time I tried to lose weight, but it was the first time I was successful. I did CICO and a lot of walking and cardio, and within 9 months i had lost 60 pounds. I was so proud, and confident, and convinced I'd never return to my ways. I never did quite reach my goal (127) but I was down to 143 at my lowest.

Then came the pandemic, and the lockdowns, and my whole life went topsy-turvy. I couldnt get out, my kid was home all the time, my husband was home all the time. It was cheaper to just cave into their meals than eat all my carefully planned ones. I quit exercising. I started binging. I stopped weighing myself, measuring myself, taking photos.

Here I am, almost completely back to square one. I was 180 pounds on Sunday when I finally mustered the courage and strength to take control of my life again. I know I can do this, because I've done it before, but that doesn't take the sting out of it. I've gained 12 inches around my hips, 13 inches around my thighs... like what? Wtf did I do? How did I let it spiral this long? I'd be lying if I said I havent been an emotional wreck all week long. I'm trying to not beat myself up about it... but I'd be lying if I said I haven't done that, too.

I'm determined, though. I can and will fix this. This was just another step in my journey. An experience to learn from, and make adjustments so I dont crumple under such sudden life changes. But last time... I was really lonely. I dont have any friends where I live, and I could really use a friend on a similar journey to share experiences with. Someone to cheer on, and care enough to cheer me on, too. I'm hoping to find that here. Preferably someone close to my stats, but I wont be picky about that, either. I will say I'd rather the person be female, though. I've had a lot of creepy guys in my PMs last time when I would post my progress, so I'm leery of guys reaching out, sorry!

0,"Going to use this to keep me accountable and post about my progress. I have bet £900 that I will lose 40lb by the 3rd October - when I win I will get £2k back.

Weight Loss Plan:
Goal: By the 30 September 2021 I will weigh 147lb and will be lean and strong.

Starting Position: I will take before photos and then weekly photos after that. I will weigh every week and I will measure my waist. I will take weekly progress photos.

Nutrition: I will eat 1,400 calories a day with a rough 30% protein, 35% fat and 35% carbs. I will plan my food each week and it will include 3x meals and an evening snack. I will think about nutrition &amp; protein intake &amp; water intake.

Workouts: before the gym re-open I will aim to walk 7,500 to 10,000 steps a day and do a home workout 3x per week based around body weight movements

After the gym re-open I will do 3x 5x5 workouts of some description and aim to get stronger on deadlifts, bench press, overhead press and squat. I will also aim to get stronger on these lifts.

I will post starting photos and measurements at some point over the next few days and I will weigh monday morning.

So I've been in a calorie deficit since January 1.. I've consistently lost about 1-1.5 pounds a week, I'm 5'2.5 and my start weight was 180. I've been eating around 1400-1500 calories with no intense exercise, just walking my dog for about an hour-ish daily!

Currently, I am sitting at 165. Now, this week has been weird... I've been dealing with some stomach issues, it's coming to that time of the month, BUT, I am down almost 5 pounds this week. I've been a little more snacky this week to supplement and upped the water, but still losing about 1/2- a pound each day.

Is this something I should be concerned about? Is this normal? I don't like things out of whack and I'm getting nervous.

I've been ""obese"" for about the last 6 years (baby weight I gained and never lost). But when the spring semester started this year, I started counting calories, eating around my goal maintenance, 1200 cals a day. I haven't been recording EVERYTHING I eat, I let myself have my 15 cal creamer without recording it and if I know my dessert will fit in my day (after I've recorded everything else), I dont bother entering that, either.

0,"Hi!

I’m female, 21, 5’4.5” and 120-125 lbs. Always been fairly slender looking and people are usually surprised that my weight is what it is.

I also run about 80-100km/ month and try to either hit the gym, if it’s open, about 3-5 times a week on top of my run OR lately since it’s closed - do a home workout using bodyweight - about 30 minutes or so. I’ve got a fairly defined core but I still look a little “fluffy” for my taste.

My diet is pretty clean, I never eat out (and if I do it’s once a month or so, because my boyfriend and I love sushi). I like fruits and veg and have some everyday. Love coffee. Have a finicky bowel though :’)

My calorie intake roughly varies from 1300 - 2200 per day (I’ve had trouble with food and restriction in the past so I’m trying to get a grip on normal eating). I’m trying to track what I eat now and not go over 1800 (I’ve had trouble keeping it at 1500 or less though, other than on days I under-eat from anxiety).

I’m a full time student in a pretty strenuous program, so a lot of my day is spent sitting - but once I’m done a year or so more, my program/career will require lots of walking and standing in the OR/hospital. This is partially why I love running because it shakes out some of my stress. I try to go on a walk, a run, and a little workout when I have time so my body doesn’t have extremely long periods of idleness. 

How many calories and how much exercise do I need if I’d like to just lean out a little? I can’t seem to shed the extra bit of fluff off my now pretty muscular legs. I’d want to lose maybe 10 lbs in a sustainable way, just to gain some more definition. I know I can MyFitnessPal it - but when I cut my calories I feel tired and foggy and can’t focus on school because of hunger. This is why intermittent fasting couldn’t be an option for me.

0,"I've been following multiple fitness plans for the past few years. Everything had been working well... until now... I have hit a very slow fat loss plateau.

I currently weight 150lbs; I am 5' 10""; My BMR is approximately 1700; I am male. 

I should mention that I currently am at a calorie deficit of 1800 calories/day except on my ""cheat meal"" days where I bump that up to 2250 calories. I track everything with MFP.

I workout 4 to 5 times per week. It currently mainly consists of 60 minutes of interval walking/running on the treadmill. My walking speed is 4MPH, and my running speed varies between 7-8MPH. I do also do about 15 minutes of bodyweight training (with the Fitify app) using a weighted backpack for many of the exercises.

According to omnicalculator, I burn approximately 700-800 calories (not sure how accurate that is) while on the treadmill. And according to my Fitify app, I burn about 100-150 calories (also not sure how accurate that is) doing the bodyweight exercises. 

I am also a part-time retail worker. I work approximately 28 hours per week.

I have went onto MANY different calorie calculator sites, but they do not allow me to input these types of figures, so it just gives me the ""typical"" estimate of my ""maintenance calories being 2500"" blah blah. But I want to know what is the best way to figure out what my ACTUAL maintenance calories should be and how many calories I should ACTUAL cut to to truly connect myself back to that fat loss track that I was sitting on.

It honestly sucks knowing that I am SO close to my weight loss goals and now it just stopped, a pudge-pool sitting around my bellybutton area that does not want to disappear.

I've been following multiple fitness plans for the past few years. Everything had been working well... until now... I have hit a very slow fat loss plateau.

I currently weight 150lbs; I am 5' 10""; My BMR is approximately 1700; I am male. 

I should mention that I currently am at a calorie deficit of 1800 calories/day except on my ""cheat meal"" days where I bump that up to 2250 calories. I track everything with MFP.

I workout 4 to 5 times per week. It currently mainly consists of 60 minutes of interval walking/running on the treadmill. My walking speed is 4MPH, and my running speed varies between 7-8MPH. I do also do about 15 minutes of bodyweight training (with the Fitify app) using a weighted backpack for many of the exercises.

According to omnicalculator, I burn approximately 700-800 calories (not sure how accurate that is) while on the treadmill. And according to my Fitify app, I burn about 100-150 calories (also not sure how accurate that is) doing the bodyweight exercises. 

I am also a part-time retail worker. I work approximately 28 hours per week.

I have went onto MANY different calorie calculator sites, but they do not allow me to input these types of figures, so it just gives me the ""typical"" estimate of my ""maintenance calories being 2500"" blah blah. But I want to know what is the best way to figure out what my ACTUAL maintenance calories should be and how many calories I should ACTUAL cut to to truly connect myself back to that fat loss track that I was sitting on.

It honestly sucks knowing that I am SO close to my weight loss goals and now it just stopped, a pudge-pool sitting around my bellybutton area that does not want to disappear. 

Thank you all so much, in advance!"

So I was thinking it would be great to find a workout that basically feels fun and easy and you get a bit warm and energized. The key being that it's not actually painful or tough to accomplish. But then you feel it the next day and it's obvious you were using your muscles after all. 

Is there a youtube workout or series something like this? I hate how so many workouts are all about working through the pain or complex yoga positions and stuff. I just want something I can do regularly and not dread but enjoy - maybe for 20-30 mins a day at home, no equipment.

I’ve been using MyFitnessPal as a tracker, and it has had my daily calories at around 1900 for the past several months for 2 lbs/ week. I played with the goals today and it dropped my daily calories down to 1500 ish for the same 2 lbs/week loss. 
I’m confused on how safe this might or might not be. My BMR calculates to around 1900/ day. Google says don’t go below the BMR at risk of being hungry, muscle loss, and lowered metabolism. But I didn’t feel like I was losing much at 1900 before. It was only about 1 lb/week. I absolutely want to fit into a kayak by August- and that means 40 lbs in 5 months. 

Can I just eat the calories for 1900 daily, and then exercise so the net is below the 1500? Or does that cause issues health wise and I need to stick to the net 1900 per day?

Hi guys!

&amp;#x200B;

So I've reached a plateau in my weight loss journey. I have been the same weight for 2 months. I track calories and generally eat healthy (fruits, mostly protein, not a lot of carbs). In regards to exercise I either go on a 4.5 km run or do a strength training session at the gym. But I have been running for those 2 months and I cannot seem to lose weight. FYI my TDEE says I have a Basal Metabolic Rate of 1719 calories per day and that my maintenance calories are 2900! I rarely eat 2900 calories but still I cannot seem to budge the scale anymore. Does anyone have any tips? Or do you think I will eventually lose weight if I keep exercising how I am exercising and tracking calories? 

Also does anyone have any recommendations on what my calorie intake should be? I am sure around 1700-2000 is reasonable. I know calorie trackers in regards to exercise are not necessarily accurate but let's just pretend they were - that would mean if I ate 1700 calories (my metabolic rate) and then kept exercising (i track with an apple watch that I burn 350 cals on a 30 min run, and 500 cals at the gym) I should probably start to lose weight, no?

I became so obsessed with CICO and eating at a deficit didn't even feel difficult. It  became natural to eat healthy. As a matter of fact, I almost hated junk food like chips, etc. They tasted bland to me. People didn't like my appearance.. and looking back I feel like I must have done a bit too much. At my lowest exactly two years ago, I was 61kg with out any muscle.

Now, after that, in the summer of 2019, I joined a gym and it actually turned out well. I seemed healthy and I actually felt like a looked better for some reason. 

This was until the pandemic. I actually lost like 3 kilos during the lockdown. Then, I moved back home and my eating habits got ruined. I ated junk all the time. I gained 10 kilos in 4 months. And then I moved out of there. Simply, because I was scared that if I stay there long, I will get fat again. 

I have been trying to lose it since then,but man is it hard. It's really hard. I have actually put on 5 kilos since coming here.(not entirely fat as I have been working out a lot). 

Today, I weighed myself, I am just 1kg shy of 80. And I immediately started on deficit. It's so hard rn,but I have to keep at it. I don't have any other choice. None of clothes fit me. I can't even run a mile now. It will be tough,really tough but have to do it.

I stepped on the scale and got 151. That was odd. This past weekend I did go to an all weekend party but I tried to limit what I ate. I didn’t like that number 151 though. I stepped back in the scale and got 150.4. Then 149.6. Then back to 151. Maybe my scale is broken but I’m taking 149. This isn’t the problem though. The problem is me not losing weight.

I’ve been on this journey since august, and it’s been rough. I’ve lost 30 or so lbs., which is okay I guess. I don’t know why my last 15 aren’t coming off as easy as the first. It’s so stubborn and the fat is in the worst areas possible. What am I doing wrong? Well i’m really lacking on sleep. I’m getting around 4-5 hours a night. On the bright side, i’ve upped from 1500 calories to 1700 calories because i’m starting to incorporate HIIT and weight training into my weight loss 4-5 times a week. Even when on a calorie deficit, can I gain muscle? Maybe the scale stagnating is because of a muscle gain? I wish some magical deity would tell me what I’m doing wrong so I can fix it and get it off within the next three months. Is losing 15lbs. doable within 3 months? I don’t know.

0,"So this week I weighed myself and gained two pounds!! I was beyond frustrated because I felt like I did everything right and better than the week before.

I started running this week instead of doing my usual HIIT workout and felt amazing. I can see myself becoming a runner. Anyways in my HIIT workout my fitness tracker says I burned around 475 calories and when running, my fitness tracker says I burned 680 in the same amount of time. I was feeling so happy and didn't indulge in sweets or snacks just more fruits and nuts. 

I was feeling hella pumped for weigh in day and was so disappointed that I gained two pounds even tho the week before I lost one pound and had two cheat days with no running just walking. And I slept way more this week also. The stars were aligned for me this week. 

However I did indulge in some pork yesterday and was told that the body takes digesting pork longer so its better to weigh yourself tomorrow for a better weight. 

Ive lost 52 pounds in 7 months with no supplements and I'm proud of that but these last 8 pounds have taken me two months to lose with maximum effort (exercising 6 times a week one hour a day) while the first 25 took me three months with less exercise and less restrictions and I was loving it. 

I've gone to the doctor and he says he can't get my blood work til June. So at this point, I really don't know what to do. Ive read people in similar situations say it's a hypothyroidism issue and I have every symptom they have but really wanted to confirm with the doctor first but I can't wait 3 months. 

Anyone else in a similar situation?",Anyone else feel like their body is working against them?,"Anyone else feel like their body is working against them?

I hope you guys are all doing well! 

My whole life I'm suffering from a Binge Eating Disorder. Most of the time my way to fight it was completely restrict me from any trigger foods. My trigger foods are sweets. My level of BED is pretty intense. To give you an idea of what I'm going through I throw in some pictures.

[This is like almost 20k calories in sweets right there. That is maybe enough for two days.](https://i.imgur.com/umn9yvP.jpg)

[This is from just one day. And it doesn't even show the fast food I had on top.](https://i.imgur.com/v9J1GJ1.jpg)

Hopefully this is not too disturbing. Despite all these bad days last year and before that I made really good progress overall. Unfortunately towards the end of 2020 I gained close to 50lbs in just under two weeks. To anyone saying it's impossible. Well I'm sure the pics above will help you make this statement more reasonable haha. The weight I have gained is all gone in 2021 and some more 💪. So that's nice I guess. 


Anyway, I did achieve that by restricting myself from all kinds of sweets again. Funnily enough I'm studying nutritional science and home economics (B.Sc. Dietetics) and I've learned a lot of helpful things already in just a few months. I mean it is nice to completely cut out any sweets. Your body loves it as the sweets don't do anything for you really. Nontheless this way of dealing with my nutrition is just not sustainable longterm. Originally I had planned to do the no sweets thing during all of 2021. I'm sure that I can do it because I can be very determined but is it really good for me in every aspect!?

Close to valentines day last month I felt a little down for some reason and ended up buying sweets [as you can see here.](https://i.imgur.com/jZFiUo8.jpg)

I didn't even plan on eating them really. I mean the thought of eating all of it at once was on my mind for sure but my willpower was way too strong. Anyway, I know that I have to learn how to deal with those trigger foods in order to beat my disorder. I mean studies show for a good reason that less than 10% of people who lose big amounts of weight will regain. Numbers are actually way worse. But why is that? Many people are saying losing weight isn't the hardest part. It is maintaining a certain weight that is the real challenge. I don't say this to offend anyone who's struggling with weight loss! Losing weight is damn hard already, we all know that!

So but why do people think that maintaining is even harder? I think when you actively decide to lose weight you set rules regarding food and activity to reach a certain weight goal. People are good at understanding that they need to leave out bad foods and create a deficit to lose weight. That's the theory. So let's assume the goal weight was achieved. What comes after that? Most people throw away their weight loss rules as there is no more weight to lose. They stop restricting themselves to certain foods and bad habits are reestablished. Imo this just happens because we don't learn a sustainable way to deal with food. 

Coming back to my case. So I had all those sweets sitting next to me literally and I had no idea what to do with it. It's not like I was sitting there straving for some or even all of it. It was just there. After week 7 of 2021 was finished I told my alright, over the course of the next week you will eat both boxes of cereal. I have never until that day eaten just a part of a box of cereal. Even at 12 years of age I would grab the MEGA box of kelloggs and eat all in one go. I told myself you will have 100g of cereal every day and that's gonna be it. This is exactly what I have done! I have not overeaten during that week. Everything went fine. I even lost weight although there were thoughts of me cheating on my diet on my mind. But nope all good!

The day after that I had half a bag of the Haribo sweets. Writing that down still creates disbelief on my mind lol. Yea I had just had half the bag and the rest for the next day. For last week I did some different testing. In the past even when I was doing well having a cheat day and not just a cheat meal would result in me bingeing for a few days. I think a cheat day creates this thought of being a failure and for me it's really hard to recover from it. So most of the time I would think ah damn it doesn't matter anyway and I keep on bingeing for a few more days. 

So last week I intentionally set myself up for a cheat day. Not a cheat day of bingeing on foods but just a day where I could have whatever I wanted. Obviously I would make sure to have certain foods that I eat like every day to cover mirconutrients. So I knew on either saturday or sunday I would have like 5-10k calories very likely. Working towards that day I cut down on ~400 calories every day. To be fair my maintenance calories are somewhere between 3-3,5k a day (I'm pretty active guy) so 400 isn't all that much actually. Anyway it created a nice little buffer going into the cheat day. 

The cheat day came on sunday and I ended up having almost exactly 7k calories that day. I did weigh myself the next day and I was up like 4lbs or so. For the week I was probably still up a bit so I decided to go with 2k calories on monday and 2,5k calories on tuesday. I stuck to those numbers. My weight is back to normal and actually a little lower than what I weighed on last friday. Even though I had 3,4k calories yesterday. 

This cheat day thing was me testing the water basically. See how I would deal with the situation right now. How it would affect me. I mean it could have thrown me off completely and I would destroy all my hard work again. I think though having planned cheat days is really bad especially while dealing with an eating disorder. So I'll not recommend anyone to do what I did. Adding cheat meals though is completely fine. Just try to stay within your calorie limit. Allowing yourself to have bad foods is completely fine. I learned that while having the cereal every day for a week. My stomach was definately not amused by the sudden intake of sugar every day but it fine in the end.

Something else I want to mention is that implenting an anchoring technique can help a ton with your ED! I Couple weeks ago I had a NLP course and learned some really interesting things. I was basically using that tecnique already. I do a home workout like 6/7 days a week. Obviously motivation can be a problem at times especially when working on certain areas (for me it's back. It's annoying to work your back without being able to use gym machines). So back days are really annoying and my motivation is not the best. Nontheless I kind of implemented some sort of anchor to still make me fo for it almost every day.

Everyday after my workout I'll hav a huge bowl of yoghurt with fruits. Any by huge I mean like 1,5-2,5kg (4-5lbs). [Looks like this.](https://i.imgur.com/ZaSkik8.jpg) This was actually 2,6kg as I had a really busy day and didn't have time for breakfast. I used 1kg of low fat quark, 600g of frozen fruits + 400g of water, 5 bananas (400g), 1 apple (200g), ~20g of walnuts. It tastes amazing. I know after every workout I'll have this super amazing bowl! I personally think rewarding yourself with food is good but obviously the whole thing is super healthy and exactly what my body needs. [Another example of what I have after a workout.](https://i.imgur.com/r321xHM.jpg) This time less yoghurt/quark but 1kg of veggies. I eat like 1kg of fruits and 500g-1kg of veggies every day if someone is curious. 

This actually got a little longer than I like it to be but maybe there's helpful information for anyone. What helped me realising that I do it wrong by restricting myself was a bodybuilder who does youtube content. He is very transparent with what he eats and I was like damn he's having cereal every day and if macros allow it like snickers ice cream in the evening. He really inspired me that you can live in a healthy way even though you allow yourself to have treats here and there. This is exactly what I want. A sustainable, overall healthy way of dealing with food without restrictions regarding certain foods. Having the background of the eating disorder makes this hard of course but not impossible! I'll work hard to get better every day.

As a little conclusion. Our relationship to food should be sustainable to reach longterm success. Treats/bad foods are allowed in certain quantities. Even holidays/birthdays where you might eat more than you usual do can easily be implemented without worries about your progress. I wish everyone here all the best and that all of you reach their goals whatever it is! Nothing is impossible!

Imo this just happens because we don't learn a sustainable way to deal with food. 

Coming back to my case. So I had all those sweets sitting next to me literally and I had no idea what to do with it. It's not like I was sitting there straving for some or even all of it. It was just there. After week 7 of 2021 was finished I told my alright, over the course of the next week you will eat both boxes of cereal. I have never until that day eaten just a part of a box of cereal. Even at 12 years of age I would grab the MEGA box of kelloggs and eat all in one go. I told myself you will have 100g of cereal every day and that's gonna be it. This is exactly what I have done! I have not overeaten during that week. Everything went fine. I even lost weight although there were thoughts of me cheating on my diet on my mind. But nope all good!

The day after that I had half a bag of the Haribo sweets. Writing that down still creates disbelief on my mind lol. Yea I had just had half the bag and the rest for the next day. For last week I did some different testing. In the past even when I was doing well having a cheat day and not just a cheat meal would result in me bingeing for a few days. I think a cheat day creates this thought of being a failure and for me it's really hard to recover from it. So most of the time I would think ah damn it doesn't matter anyway and I keep on bingeing for a few more days. 

So last week I intentionally set myself up for a cheat day. Not a cheat day of bingeing on foods but just a day where I could have whatever I wanted. Obviously I would make sure to have certain foods that I eat like every day to cover mirconutrients. So I knew on either saturday or sunday I would have like 5-10k calories very likely. Working towards that day I cut down on ~400 calories every day. To be fair my maintenance calories are somewhere between 3-3,5k a day (I'm pretty active guy) so 400 isn't all that much actually. Anyway it created a nice little buffer going into the cheat day. 

The cheat day came on sunday and I ended up having almost exactly 7k calories that day. I did weigh myself the next day and I was up like 4lbs or so. For the week I was probably still up a bit so I decided to go with 2k calories on monday and 2,5k calories on tuesday. I stuck to those numbers. My weight is back to normal and actually a little lower than what I weighed on last friday. Even though I had 3,4k calories yesterday. 

This cheat day thing was me testing the water basically. See how I would deal with the situation right now. How it would affect me. I mean it could have thrown me off completely and I would destroy all my hard work again. I think though having planned cheat days is really bad especially while dealing with an eating disorder. So I'll not recommend anyone to do what I did. Adding cheat meals though is completely fine. Just try to stay within your calorie limit. Allowing yourself to have bad foods is completely fine. I learned that while having the cereal every day for a week. My stomach was definately not amused by the sudden intake of sugar every day but it fine in the end.

Something else I want to mention is that implenting an anchoring technique can help a ton with your ED! I Couple weeks ago I had a NLP course and learned some really interesting things. I was basically using that tecnique already. I do a home workout like 6/7 days a week. Obviously motivation can be a problem at times especially when working on certain areas (for me it's back. It's annoying to work your back without being able to use gym machines). So back days are really annoying and my motivation is not the best. Nontheless I kind of implemented some sort of anchor to still make me fo for it almost every day.

Everyday after my workout I'll hav a huge bowl of yoghurt with fruits. Any by huge I mean like 1,5-2,5kg (4-5lbs). [Looks like this.](https://i.imgur.com/ZaSkik8.jpg) This was actually 2,6kg as I had a really busy day and didn't have time for breakfast. I used 1kg of low fat quark, 600g of frozen fruits + 400g of water, 5 bananas (400g), 1 apple (200g), ~20g of walnuts. It tastes amazing. I know after every workout I'll have this super amazing bowl! I personally think rewarding yourself with food is good but obviously the whole thing is super healthy and exactly what my body needs. [Another example of what I have after a workout.](https://i.imgur.com/r321xHM.jpg) This time less yoghurt/quark but 1kg of veggies. I eat like 1kg of fruits and 500g-1kg of veggies every day if someone is curious. 

This actually got a little longer than I like it to be but maybe there's helpful information for anyone. What helped me realising that I do it wrong by restricting myself was a bodybuilder who does youtube content. He is very transparent with what he eats and I was like damn he's having cereal every day and if macros allow it like snickers ice cream in the evening. He really inspired me that you can live in a healthy way even though you allow yourself to have treats here and there. This is exactly what I want. A sustainable, overall healthy way of dealing with food without restrictions regarding certain foods. Having the background of the eating disorder makes this hard of course but not impossible! I'll work hard to get better every day.

As a little conclusion. Our relationship to food should be sustainable to reach longterm success. Treats/bad foods are allowed in certain quantities. Even holidays/birthdays where you might eat more than you usual do can easily be implemented without worries about your progress. I wish everyone here all the best and that all of you reach their goals whatever it is! Nothing is impossible!

So according to MFP, I’ve been logging my food every day for 232 days. I’m feeling pretty bummed out cause I feel I’ve been consistent, I’m using a food scale, I’m trying to overestimate calories when I can’t get an exact measurement. I thought by this time I’d be around 60lbs lost, with my goal being to hit 80lbs lost by the one year mark, but that seems pretty unlikely though. MFP says that as long as I’m eating less than 1800 calories a day then I should be losing about 1 pound a week. I’ve been eating less than that so I can lose faster, but never less than a 1000! Most of the time my weeks average around 1300 - 1500 calories. I found that around the beginning of February/ end of January I had started to plateau at my current weight, so I decided to try to stick more closely to 1400 calories. I’m still stuck. Is it possible that by doing too much of a calorie deficit I’ve stunted my metabolism? I thought even if that was the case cutting more calories would still show some results. I’ll admit I haven’t been the most consistent when it comes to exercise. I find it really hard to exercise regularly all by myself, and no one in my household ever wants to work out or even go for a walk with me. The only exercise I’ve ever really enjoyed doing by myself is swimming, but the pool by my house is still closed. I’ve been trying to do some resistance training, just following along to some YouTube videos, but it leaves me so sore and unmotivated the next day. 
I know the key with all of this is to stick through it, I’m just frustrated. Thought I’d be a lot further along by now than I am. It’s really hard not to compare my progress to some of you guys on here, y’all are doing so good! 
Sorry, needed somewhere to let this out. The people around me are well meaning but don’t offer the healthiest weight loss advice...
I’m not the first person to plateau, so if any of you guys have any advice for staying motivated during one, I’d really appreciate it.",Frustration.,"Frustration. F24 5”9 SW:285 CW:240 GW:160

I am having trouble finding the motivation and/or willpower to get back on track. A little bit about myself: 

I am 34 years old, 5'8"", and currently at 187lbs. Two years ago, I was at 195lbs and fed up with how I felt/looked. I am not sure what got into my head, but I just decided one day to make a change. I started out just counting calories and walking on the treadmill. I was seeing SMALL changes, but not to my satisfaction. I did my research and decided on a keto diet. I went HARD on keto for 8 months (along with daily exercise - yoga and treadmill) and lost 40lbs. I felt great. I had my days where I missed bread and beer, but I even made it through the holidays without falling off the wagon. At that time, my weight started to plateau, because I got lazy. I found excuses not to work out, and summer was coming, so I wanted to be able to enjoy picnic foods/beer with friends. 

Then, COVID happened. I was working from home and couldn't go out. I sat at home and worked from my couch. I snacked all the time, because it was there. I literally stopped caring about my weight/health because it was easier to be lazy. I continuously was gaining weight, and every once in awhile I'd think ""What am I doing"" and would decide to eat better and exercise. This would last a day or two. Then I'd be back to bad habits. I'm back in the office now, and find myself going to McDs at least 2x a week. Even though I tell myself that morning that this day will be different. 

I am just at a loss right now. I'm at a place where I know I need to get back on the diet/exercise train (my clothes don't fit, I feel sluggish, I don't feel like I look good), but I can't find that motivation/willpower I had before. I don't THINK it's depression (I am diagnosed, but have a steady/working medication management), but that could be a factor. 

I'm just looking for somewhere that I can work with others and share my feelings, goals, accomplishments, and setbacks. I am hoping this is the right place. I kept saying that I was going to start doing better, but maybe by putting it out here in the reddit-verse, I will feel held accountable.","Hello, I'm New Here and Need MOTIVATION!","Hello, I'm New Here and Need MOTIVATION!

0,"Hi, i wasnt always fit, more like i was just that big guy at 6f2i and about 170 pounds. I eat a lot, like a lot, but i wasnt getting fat because i was always doing something, walking everywhere, running sometimes, bicycling everyday,  in one day i would have about 30k+ steps.  After corona began i stayed home at first, i went from 170 to 190 in about 3 weeks because of lack of movement. Staying home made me anxious and i started using xanax, in no time i was total addict and i can say i was junkie, but with this, i did not gave a damn about staying home, i was outside everyday, going from place to place with no meaning, i did not eat much, i was starving a lot, but under influance i had no idea. in about 3 weeks i went from 190 to 150 pounds. I was getting a bit skinny and i liked it, i went to rehab because of my addiction, i almost lost my living, i sold my TV and most of my clothes to get money for xanax.  After 2 month rehab i was back, no need for xanax, but i just cant loose weight. Since i stoped with xanax i started eating, maybe to fulfill my addiction with another one. After  4 months of sobriety (2 months rehab 4 months on my own) I went from about 150 pounds to my todays 234 pounds.

I dont have enough power to keep myself from eating alot, think its maybe one of the reasons i never went back to xanax that destroyed me.

I tried lot of diets but i just cant keep with it.. If i dont eat enough (enough for me is about 4000 calories atleast) i start to feel hungry and i just cant think about nothing else then me sleeping on a sidewalk totaly out of it drugged up.. It literaly makes me super anxious..

My question is -  Am I able to loose 60 pounds which is my goal with just simple excercises? I have pretty much no stamina because of astma, i cant do even 1 push up because i have no movement, i work from home and also study from home, not a lot of free time.

I need some advice for simple excercises and im willing to try a simple diet.. i just dont want to be this fat (230 pounds is maybe not that extreme but i have literaly no muscles, carrying a bag of groceries is like powerlifting for me).

I started at 84kgs. I am using the HealthifyMe app to track calories it has items that are consumed on a  daily basis in my country. The only issue I faced was with constipation. I have included corn ladyfinger, cabbage other veggies in my diet but I still seem to face the issue. Also I tried 85% dark choclate and I felt very bloated and uneasy the next day.

Its been 50 days since pizza or garlic breads or kfc chicken, when I do get the urges I use an Airfryer to make french fries. 

I tried the eating junk food but I just couldnt keep my portions small. I felt super agitated knowing the choclate bar or.pizza slice is still in the fridge

It felt easier without even tasting them, its almost like I had a taste I needed tp have more but when I dont have it I am chill no twitches or some sort anxiety.

I also reduced my goals to max 2  avoiding mental strain has helped a huge deal in cutting down my eating.

I started typing this up on the daily thread, and it got so long, and I know there's other folks on here who also have a history of disordered eating, and maybe it will resonate with some of you. But this is my first post so if this is an inappropriate solo post or in the wrong place please let me know!

I got out of the shower today and realized literally all I've been thinking about all day is calories, macros, calories, macros, entering my calories, macros, planning my calories for tomorrow. it's been like this for a few days, and today I saw it for what it is. It's the same disordered patterns of thinking that haunted me during my teens and again in my early twenties and now they're back again. 

I've been tired, dragging, and miserable in my body for the past few days. I've been eating 1100 calories and thinking ""I'm not hungry anymore"" even though I've been exercising every day. I've been wondering why I felt so bad when the weather was so nice and I had finally gotten through my weight plateau.

It seems pretty obvious to me now: I was not eating enough and obsessing over the food I did eat.

I don't want to me miserable again. I don't want to lose weight at the cost of all my mental health. I had been doing so good! I've been doing CICO for almost three months and it's been working and I've been happy - not feeling deprived or obsessive. I hit a (small) plateau recently, and I think that really brought on a lot of my obsessive thinking. So, I'm going to take a break from tracking and weighing for (at least) a week.

Honestly, though, I'm just so sad right now. I thought I was better than this now. I thought I had healed from my obsessive thinking. and now it's back. But, unlike before, I saw it. I recognized it.

0,"I’m 24F 5’7. and currently at 88.5 kg (195 lbs). I had thyroid cancer which probably contributed to me suddenly gaining a lot of weight. I underwent a pretty big surgery (and a few comolications) a little over a year ago. My plan was to shed the weight after surgery but things got complicated. Between recovery from having my throat literally slit and the pandemic I couldn’t workout consistently or bring myself to cook healthy meals. 

The point is, looking in the mirror makes me want to cry but I can never follow through with diets!! I was seeing a nutritionist and had gone down to about 84 kg (185 lbs) but her meal plan was honest to god plain sad. I was supposed to eat eggs and steamed veggies like 6 times a week and she was basically a bully. I know there’s thousands of info online and good meal plans but I always give up after a few weeks and I am a master at making excuses for myself. I’m a devoted reader of this sub and I don’t think anyone could give me any piece of advice for weightloss I haven’t read or heard about before. I just want to know how you guys just get up and do what you’re supposed to do and then KEEP DOING IT in the long run!??

(Sidenote: I do go to therapy and although I’ve discovered a lot about myself I don’t think I’ve gotten to the root of the problem psychologically) I honestly think I’m just lazy and prefer eating delicious and unhealthy food. 

My neck has finally completely healed so I started to go back to my old crossfit gym. I am obviously out of shape and can’t take a lot of cardio but I can get through most routines just fine. I know exercise will get easier with time and I am slowly working up from going 3x to going 5x a week but I know it’s basically useless without proper diet. Am I being too hard on myself? Or is that me excusing myself again?

What are consistency/motivation/discipline tips? 
My biggest issues are portion control and being too lazy to cook for myself so end up eating whatever crap I can throw together quickly or just order food.

0,"Like the title says... about 2 years ago, I went from 404 lbs, the heaviest I've ever been, and through going on daily walks and CICO, I dropped down into the 330s after about 4 months. I had never felt better. At at about 1600 a day (sometimes going over). I felt full of energy, felt like so much more confident. Then one day, about 4 months in... I just stopped. 

I remember what I was doing that day. I was driving home from work and drove past a McDonalds. I don't know why, but impulsively went through the drive through and got a double quarter pounder meal (large of course) and a 5 piece chicken select. I fucking sat there in my car and ate it all in less than 10 minutes. After that day, I never could keep up CICO for more than 3 days. 

Today, I stepped on the scale again and I'm all the way back up to 397. I feel defeated. I feel disgusting. I feel like I'm going to die. This fucking sickness that I can't beat is going to kill me early. I just had my daughter in November. She's 4 months old, and I'm terrified that I'm going to have a heart attack by the time I'm 40 and I'm never going to get to see her become an adult. 

Even knowing this... even having this fear. I just feel so helpless. Why can't I get back to whatever I was doing those 4 months? I felt so GOOD. Why can't I just do it? It doens't help that I work in a restaurant where I'm surrounded by food all day. It's so easy to just fill my cup with soda all day every day.

This isn't an easy post for me to make because I've restarted so many times, I can't keep count. It's always a new cycle of starting over, overeating, and then gaining all the weight back anymore. Two days ago I stepped on the scale and reached my highest weight of 148 lbs at 5'4.5 or 5'5. I am on the track team at my college, but my weight has stopped me from breaking my own personal records. I used to be 110 at 5'4.5 or 5'5 in high school when I was at my prime speed. I got really sick over the summer, and was on medication that makes you gain weight. However, it isn't just the medication. When I came into college, I started eating like absolute shit. 

I entered a cycle of binging on pizza, fries, cookies, and ice cream. Sometimes it would happen multiple times per day. I remember in high school, I used to eat a bunch of fruit, chicken salads, and a protein/rice combo every single day. I had a really hard time adjusting to the food at college because it was so different from what I was used to eating.

I really want to start over for real this time, and take accountability for my actions as well. I am considering posting every single week to update on my journey. I don't want to track my calories as that has led to heavy restriction and binging in the past. What are some unusual tips that have helped you lose weight for real this time? Please feel free to go into detail and elaborate, not just I ate less and exercise more. How did you get into the right headspace to losing all the weight.

0,"I started losing weight before I got pregnant because I wanted to have more energy and mobility to take care of a future kid. I started keeping track of what I was eating and trying to do some sort of exercise every day (which, for me, results in exercising about five days a week on average, since there are some days when it just doesn’t happen). It was working, I was feeling better and better, and I got pregnant! Yay!

So now I’m in my second trimester, the stage where you want to be putting on at least some weight, regardless of where you started. I’ve kept up with the routine, increasing my total calories for baby-growing, and I think it’s still having lots of benefits. But I do miss having the decreasing number on the scale to show my progress. And I’m at a point where movement is starting to become gradually more difficult, which feels a bit like regressing, even though I know it’s not. I’m confident that healthy habits are contributing to making my pregnancy easier, even though getting more pregnant feels a lot like getting out of shape again.

My question is this: what other milestones do you notice or keep track of when it comes to eating well and exercising, besides weight loss?

0,"Okay so I've been doing awesome until today when, after getting accidentally glutened when my partner misread a box, I decided to eat half of a butter tart his mom dropped off around lunch time. 

Normally, I don't touch gluten because I have celiac. Even when my partner makes a frozen pizza, I don't touch it and it takes no effort to not eat any. But because I got accidentally glutened, I ended up making a bad choice. 

The question is: what's the healthiest way to get back on the wagon? Do I just go back to what I was supposed to normally eat for dinner? Or do I ""make up"" for the calories by eating less/nothing for dinner?

I have an impulse to skip dinner and ""make up"" for the calories of the tart. But it occurred to me to ask, because many of my food-related impulses are unhealthy.

The question is: what's the healthiest way to get back on the wagon? Do I just go back to what I was supposed to normally eat for dinner? Or do I ""make up"" for the calories by eating less/nothing for dinner?

I have an impulse to skip dinner and ""make up"" for the calories of the tart. But it occurred to me to ask, because many of my food-related impulses are unhealthy. Halp?"

Growing up my mom always told me to eat an apple if I was craving junk food. I hated that advice!!!

However...

I am realizing that I can eat TONS of fruits and veggies for very little calories. And since I HATE feeling hungry this has been a life saver.

Just now, I was feeling hungry but accounting for dinner in a few hours I only had 150 calories left for the day. I have some healthier prepackaged snacks like popcorn for 100 calories, but I like to save at least 100 calories for the evening when I feel snacky before bed.

First I said to myself “you can wait 2 hours til dinner”. But then I remembered snapping at my husband the other day because I was hangry. So nope not gonna wait.

Second I said, “well I can have a grilled cheese sandwich and cut back on dinner to make up for it”. I know I’m not gonna be good at cutting back on dinner so also not an option.

THEN I realized.... I could eat a salad. 2 cups of pre chopped lettuce is 20 calories. 1 tbsp of dressing is 20 calories. Sprinkled with some seasonings.

Now I’m satisfied but not too full for dinner and have plenty of calories left for a pre bed time snack!!!

Other low cal fruits and veggies I’ve been enjoying:

- riced cauliflower with garlic salt, pepper, and drop of sesame oil

- Pre sliced apples. Dunno why but when they are pre sliced I’m more likely to grab them

- veggie soup from scratch (example: onions, carrots, celery, mushrooms, cabbage in a beef or chicken broth)

- bananas

- tangelos

- baby carrots

I dropped 48 pounds a few years ago in an extremely short period of time and am *still* dealing with the negative consequences, none of which were worth the time I “saved” by dieting quickly.

I am a 5’7” active female who didn’t do the proper research before deciding to lose weight. I saw the number on the scale, freaked out, and went to work on the problem. I picked the “magic” 1200-calorie budget I thought was standard for all females (hint, hint: it’s actually *not* standard for most females) and ramped up physical activity *a lot*.

By the time I figured out how bad I had messed up, my body started freaking out. I lost my period (for 3+ years) but worse, I obtained Binge Eating Disorder as my body’s way of dealing with the trauma of quick weight loss.

So, now, not only have I gained the weight back, I have been battling BED for years and my hormones are still messed up (my period showed up for the first time in three years in October and November 2020 but then disappeared again and hasn't been back since).

I did not save time by losing weight fast. Instead, I wasted years and messed myself up physically and mentally. 

Once my hormones re-regulate and I have a mentally and physically healthy relationship with food and exercise, I will lose weight and I will do it at the slowest rate possible while still making reasonable progress.

This is the most activity I've done since I was a kid and I am hitting my calorie goal every day without even counting the calories burned through excercises. 

Its really starting to get to me and I feel like all of this effort is for nothing. Has anyone else experienced this? I know plateau is normal but for 3 weeks after doing high intensity excercise?

Any advice? 

Thank you!"

Before I track my calories to lose weight I want to see what some of you have to say because most of you are super helpful. I measured my TDEE with a calculator.

So pretend that was my body fat and pretend I run everyday (I try to run everyday and am pretty good at that - also according to my apple watch I burn 320 cals on each run so pretend that is right too). It calculated my TDEE to be 2900 cals which I honestly don't believe and my basal metabolic rate was 1700 calories. I am looking to lose 15-20 pounds. Do you think if I eat at 1700 calories and run everyday I will be in good shape to lose that 15-20 pounds? Let me know! Stay safe.",TDEE advice,"TDEE advice Hi guys,

I've struggled with weight my whole life, as I'm sure have many of us here. Sometimes I have trouble just seeing how much I've lost, sometimes I feel like my scale is just lying to me about it. I don't really have anywhere else to post this since I'm still not comfortable enough with my body to post it on other social media. I know I still have a long way to go but I figured I'd post here anyway just to celebrate getting below 200lbs for probably the first time since high school.

The heaviest I weighed myself was 262lbs, 34% bodyfat on Oct 19th 2019. Since then I realized I needed to change something, I wasn't happy with who I was and it affected how I viewed myself everyday, it still does sometimes. I started with Keto to lose the first 20lbs and from there I got a gym membership and started going with a good friend of mine. Once I started at the gym I lost interest in Keto and just stuck to maintaining a caloric deficit. I used a calculator to figure out my macros and stuck to around 1800 calories a day, focusing mostly on my protein intake, my goal was to lose 2lbs a week. I went to the gym 5 days a week for a couple months until they had to close in my province.

 I'm not sitting at 198Lbs around 18% bodyfat, which means I'm still in the overweight category. My goal weight isn't really set in stone, I just want to get to somewhere I'm happy with, for now my goal is 190lbs, then it'll be 180lbs, and so on.","M/21/6'1"" [262-198=64 LBS] My current before and after pics","M/21/6'1"" [262-198=64 LBS] My current before and after pics [Front view](https://imgur.com/a/MhNQG3y)

I’d like some help losing weight, I’ve been slim/average sized my whole life but recently over a lockdown, I’ve put on some weight around my stomach and especially my thighs; because I wasn’t being active, it also didn’t help that all motivation was lost due to mental health issues that I suffer with.

I’ve been doing some home workouts and eating healthy but usually my education gets in the way. If there are any meal plans that I could use for weight loss that are free, please link it down below because that would be beyond helpful. 

I used to have a 25/26 inch waist, hip size was 39 inches, now I’m 28/29 inches around the waist and 41 on my hips which is only slight increase but I’m not happy with it. I also went up two cup sizes, from a 23DD to 32/34E which I’m not exactly complaining about!

I’m currently walking around 10000 steps a day, to &amp; from my place of education, I want to start going on runs early in the morning but I can now only go on weekends, I’m not sure how beneficial runs would be but I can’t do as much as I’d want to because gyms aren’t open!

I know BMIs aren't the most reliable tool for health and weight, but in all my years as a Wii Fit owner I have always been categorized as overweight. Today I heard the ""Normal"" jingle for the first time!

Some background; I'm male, 24-years-old, and I reached my heaviest weight last Christmas at 96kg / 211lbs. The first week of January, I started intermittently fasting and exercising using the Wii Fit. I'm a sucker for nostalgia, and the Wii was my first game console, so the Miis, menus and music bring me a lot of joy (even if exercising is a drag). I'm also an introvert, so exercising from the privacy of home is a plus. Today, I weigh 82.5kg / 182lbs. 

For anyone thinking about purchasing or dusting off a Wii Fit, I totally recommend for it. I believe that most of my weight loss is because of the changes to my eating habits, but the Wii Fit has been a great tool for accountability. The balance games and dance routines mixed in with cardio and strength training are also surprisingly fun and sort of make you forget that you're working out. 

I've still got a ways to go, but little milestones like this are great motivators to keep on keeping on.","Today I crossed over the line into ""Normal"" from ""Overweight"" on the Wii Fit!","Today I crossed over the line into ""Normal"" from ""Overweight"" on the Wii Fit!

After my first day of logging calories into myfitnesspal on 3/25/20, I am pleased to report that I have reached the goal my doctor has given me since I started seeing her 4 years ago, I'm at 175, a BMI of 26.6, and while not in the ""normal"" range, my doctor told me that it's a fine weight for men of my height and will be healthy for me. I definitely still have another 10-20 lbs left in the tank, and my goal now is to maintain between 155-175 going forward and get down another 10 lbs, holding muscle mass constant of course over the next 6-12 months. My original goal was to be under 230 by this time, starting on March 25th at 318, and weighing in in Feb 2020 at 333 and half trying for a couple months, I built in some setbacks into my timeline. But I had ZERO SETBACKS! I just gritted my teeth and plowed through the early phases of weight loss, when the work you put in pays off marginally for a long time, and man oh man was it worth it!!

Once I got below 250, every 5 lbs lost was noticeable. I bought 2xl's in June of 2020 when I was in the 270s and 260s, they fit me for 90 days, they were night shirts for 90 more days, and now they're just WAY too big. My waist size was 50 when I was in the 300s, it was only 48 at 250, but is 34 now at 175. The work you put in pays off, but not immediately, and that's what I've found is key to this, you just have to grit your teeth and put in the work in the first third of your journey through long weight loss. Like literally everyone else who's had success, I have no stories about a magic pill, or getting results by not putting in work. But I will offer some wisdom:

Dieting should be a challenge, but it should not be miserable. Do not restrict yourself. IF, Keto, and other diets work great for some people, and for others they fail miserably. I was in this category and recognized that previous attempts weren't working, they made me miserable, and I went back to old habits before I lost my 50th pound.  Calorie counting was challenging, but I kept myself to a range. 1200-2000 at first, averaging 1600. Then I ticked it up to 1500-2500, averaging 1750. Then as I got closer to goal, I ticked it to 1750-2500, averaging 1900, which is where I currently am, and don't plan to change anytime soon. The average may tick up as I get close to/into the normal range, or decide to build more muscle, but it's all dependent on my TDEE and my fitbit keeping me in check with calories burned estimates.

0,"Want to change your eating habits permanently? Change the foods that you consider to be ""normal.""

We all know (or you will know soon if you're in this sub) that you have to consume less calories than you expend to lose weight, AND that you have to maintain better eating habits after you lose weight in order to keep from regaining it back. But how?  You have to change what you think is normal so that you can stop thinking about food all the time.

This isn't a post about intuitive eating (IE), but I will say that the *idea* of IE is the holy grail of food-related behavioral change.  I want to be able to eat what I want, when I want, but I need ""what I want when I want"" to just so happen to coincide with how I want my body to look.

We live in an obesogenic environment, and a big factor of that is based on what we perceive to be the 'normal' caloric profile of the foods available to us.

For example, there's no reason that 'regular' Jif/Skippy peanut butter has to be your normal when you think about peanut butter.  Do you know PBFit? 70 calories vs 190 calories for the same volume. If you went to the grocery store and saw ""Double Stuffed Extra Sweet Peanut Butter"" would you ever buy it as more than a novelty? Probably not.  Well, that is what 'regular' PB is compared to PBFit.

The same thing with jelly.  The regular jelly has *sugar added*. (because grapes aren't sweet enough apparently).

Same thing with ice cream, beer, popcorn, soda, cheese, yogurt, salad dressing, bbq sauce, syrup.  There are amazing choices in all of these categories that make the normal versions look like literal candy and fat bombs.  Nobody wants candy all the time but that's what we eat.  On top of that, veggies are freakin' amazing.  Sooo many veggies out there and you actually don't have to slop them in oil for them to be good either.

Stop thinking of low-calorie-density foods as ""lite alternatives"" to regular foods and start thinking of them as the default.  Start thinking about the 'normal stuff' as extra-sweet, added-fats, etc. *because they are and it's because they want you to buy it.*  But those are treats, those aren't your daily use stuff.

Start searching for delicious, low-calorie-density foods and recipes that fill you up and make those your 'defaults.'  You will lower your average overall calorie intake with long-term sustainable habits.

Anyway, that was kind of a nonsensical rant by the end, but I hope you enjoy it.","Change what you consider ""default""","Change what you consider ""default"" Want to change your eating habits permanently? Change the foods that you consider to be ""normal.""

We all know (or you will know soon if you're in this sub) that you have to consume less calories than you expend to lose weight, AND that you have to maintain better eating habits after you lose weight in order to keep from regaining it back. But how?  You have to change what you think is normal so that you can stop thinking about food all the time.

This isn't a post about intuitive eating (IE), but I will say that the *idea* of IE is the holy grail of food-related behavioral change.  I want to be able to eat what I want, when I want, but I need ""what I want when I want"" to just so happen to coincide with how I want my body to look.

0,"I just wanted to share my recent weight loss that has brought a smile to my face.

Back in January, after a saga of my grandmother being in hospital and subsequently passing away, I stress ate to the high heavens undoing all the weightloss I achieved prior to Christmas. I got back to University and weighed myself and found I was 152.3kg. I was horrified and extremely upset by that. I knew I'd put some weight back on, because clothes were tighter and my knee pain had gotten a little worse, but not to that effect.

I decided then I was going to stop stress eating all together. I cut out all the fizzy drinks and sugary nonsense I was throwing into my mouth on a daily basis and decided that I was gonna change myself. I started eating lower carb, in the hopes of stabilising my blood sugar but with placement for my nursing course starting, I found I just lacked the energy to do my job properly. I decided I would eat my standard diet 3 days a week while I was at the hospital, as those are my most active days without a doubt, and keep the low carb on my days off, where I am much less active due to the Covid lockdown in place right now.

I have to say, I think this has been the approach I have needed and weighed myself today to discover that I had weighed in at 139.6kg. I've also been working out religiously and my body has been eating that up. When I was in highschool, I was an active kid. No athlete mind you, I've always was the big kid, but I did my fair share of sport. I played rugby, did judo, mountain biking, hiking and many more. Sadly, due to injuries (some from said sports, some from an RTA), I can't workout with that intensity. Luckily I'd been working with low intensity programs with kettlebells and discovered a dude called Mark Wildman on YouTube. Having used his programming, I am finding it is meshing well with my lifestyle and I hope to keep it applied as long as I possibly can. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share my victory and ramble a bit about how I got here. My goal is to get to 95-100kg as that's what my body sat nice at when I was younger and very active, although that could change if I feel like it needs.

0,"Hi all! Basically I gained 20 pounds during the quarantine. I just really wasn’t taking care of myself. I really want to get back to my original weight 100-105 pounds. I’m 5 feet tall. 24 years old. 

For the past week, I have eaten the following:
-one gallon of water throughout the day
-1/3 cup oats mixed with a 1/4 cup blueberries
-a medium sized apple
-one cup chickpeas and 1/2 cup of couscous with some type of veggie mixed in
-organ protein powder (one to two scoops) one tablespoon of peanut butter and a tablespoon of flax seeds
-one slice of Ezekiel bread with 64grams of tempeh and a bit of sugar free ketchup 
-a Boca protein pattie with veggies and a 6 oz potato.
-according to my fitness pal: 1300 calories / 80 grams protein / 198 grams carbs / 30 grams of fat.

For exercise, I’m doing a half hour of cardio 5 days a week, lifting 5 days a week. Resting twice a week. According to my watch, I burn between 500-700 calories during my workouts.

It’s been a week and I am exactly the same weight. In fact, the the mirror I look bigger. I know it’s only been a week and I shouldn’t expect much. But I’m so concerned and nervous I am doing something wrong. I hired a trainer and she said I should be losing 1.5 pounds a week and so far that’s not happening.

For reference, I ate really bad since the pandemic started and stopped working out. I barely drank water. I went to the bathroom regularly and I noticed now, I am having a bit trouble going (TMI, I’m sorry!).

I have not diverted from the diet once, I give it my all during every workout. I haven’t been on a weight loss journey before so can anyone give input one why my weight is the same and I appear bigger in front of the mirror. I’m new to all this, please, please be gentle on me 😬. Thank you in advance!!!!

Exercise has been a great place for me to challenge my limiting beliefs, but sometimes I will hear a really negative thought like 'I don't deserve to do well' and the thought will cause me to physically slow myself down after hearing it, because I don't think I deserve to run at faster speed and push myself, even though that's what I was doing prior to that thought.

Trying to lose weight and using a food scale to help. One important qualifier is that I’m on a medication with the known side effect of appetite loss.

Since using a food scale and cooking my own food instead of relying on takeout, I’ve noticed that I average about 1000 calories per day. This is pretty much all vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, etc. I’m not huge on grains, which seem to trigger my IBS at random. I don’t eat dairy or eggs, and eat meat very rarely. I would really like to be at 1500-1800 calories, which seems much safer.

Weekends, I put the food scale away and eat takeout. I still try to choose vegetable heavy, nutrient dense options, but beyond that I don’t fuss. I would estimate I eat about 3000-5000 calories over the course of the weekend.

My doctor is not exactly enthused about this eating schedule, but has also said nutrition is really not his speciality and that in the case of my medication, it’s far more important to eat small meals throughout the day, and that the amount of calories is less relevant.

My question is, am I screwing up my metabolism or body by doing this? I am genuinely not hungry at the end of the day and, while I can make myself eat more, sometimes I can’t keep it down.

Sample Weekday:

Breakfast: coffee, green smoothie w chia seeds and soy milk

Lunch: 3 pieces of fruit, which unfortunately can take me over an hour to consume

**Squash**

A few weeks ago I posted my Spaghetti Squash Casserole recipe, and I've also done soups, and I've talked about roasts and squashes can be really nice roasted. I usually have one dish of the week during the colder months that includes squash, butternut, acorn, spaghetti, pumpkin, as a star or just in a major supporting role.

With the aid of my trusty Instant Pot, I can cook a whole butternut squash in less than 30 minutes. Acorn squash too. These preparations tend to be pretty easy. Place the squash (halved and seeded or not) on a trivet with 1 cup of water in the pressure cooker and set the pressure cooker for 8-12 minutes. with 10 minutes to pressurize and depressurize you get yummy squash in a fraction or the time or work to cook it. I like squash lightly seasoned with salt as a side. Add a bit of butter, maple syrup and pie spices and have it as dessert. You can cook it a bit longer so that it can easily be pureed and turned into a hearty soup, etc... etc...

However that's not the recipe I want to focus on today.

Today's recipe is for when you do have squash on hand plenty of time to cook and want something seriously fulfilling that will stick to your ribs and satisfy the soul. 

https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/butternut-squash-risotto-crispy-pancetta

Risotto seems like it violates everything there is to be said for ""diet food"" it's white rice, with butter and cheese and in this case some crispy pancetta (can substitute prosciuto or bacon or omit entirely) but in the right portion it can easily fit most calorie budgets and be a great way to incorporate whatever ingredients you have that are currently in season or on hand.

- 2.5 cups arborio rice [1600 kcal]
- 1.5 pound butternut squash [625 kcal]
- 0.25 pound pancetta [345 kcal]
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter [400 kcal]
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil [350 kcal]
- 0.5 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving [200 kcal]
- 1 cup dry white wine [90 kcal]
- 5.5 cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth [80 kcal]
- 1 medium onion, finely diced [40 kcal]
- 8 sage leaves [0 kcal]
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper [0 kcal]

All together this recipe makes 8 servings, each clocking in at 470 kcal according to MFP [16/68/10 fat/carbs/protein] I usually cut the recipe in half and it just absolutely fills you up. The risotto keeps well in the fridge and makes a reapparance later in the week as either dinner another night or just have it for lunch (We'll often break it down the second half of the pot into three lunches at just over 300 kcal). I will often pair it with a quickly cooked baby spinach with garlic and lemon for a bit more greens.

Hi everyone,

I’ve been trying to lose weight since the first week of December (worst time to start a diet by the way!) Been on my weight loss journey for exactly three months. 

For anyone interested in my diet, I did lazy keto for the month of December, got more disciplined in January with a few slip-ups here and there, then really became militant on February 1 when I incorporated intermittent fasting along with keto and strict calorie counting. What a game changer that is. Snacking at night is my kryptonite. 

As for nutrition, I try to stay between 1000-1100 calories per day (my doctor OK’d this because I was, and am still, clinically obese). I eat mainly whole foods - lots of meat (including red meat), eggs, whole dairy, and vegetables. Maybe once a month I’ll treat myself to McDonalds where I’ll indulge in a Big Mac with half a bun. Other than that, I cook all of my meals at home. 

Now onto exercise. For the first two months, I walked for 90 minutes 3x per week. Now I walk for an hour about once or twice per week. I think once I get closer to my goal weight, I’ll incorporate strength training to look more toned. 

My ultimate goal weight is 130lbs and I want to be there by the end of August. I can’t wait to see what my body will look like then. I’m hoping for an hourglass figure!

Anyways, I’ve had a really difficult time personally the last three months and seeing this actually work out for me brings me happiness because it’s one of the only things going well in my life.",F/27/5’1” [212-180=32 lbs] Mid-progress before and after pics,"F/27/5’1” [212-180=32 lbs] Mid-progress before and after pics [Pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/DyfsFfQ)

For anyone interested in my diet, I did lazy keto for the month of December, got more disciplined in January with a few slip-ups here and there, then really became militant on February 1 when I incorporated intermittent fasting along with keto and strict calorie counting. What a game changer that is. Snacking at night is my kryptonite. 

As for nutrition, I try to stay between 1000-1100 calories per day (my doctor OK’d this because I was, and am still, clinically obese). I eat mainly whole foods - lots of meat (including red meat), eggs, whole dairy, and vegetables. Maybe once a month I’ll treat myself to McDonalds where I’ll indulge in a Big Mac with half a bun. Other than that, I cook all of my meals at home. 

Now onto exercise. For the first two months, I walked for 90 minutes 3x per week. Now I walk for an hour about once or twice per week. I think once I get closer to my goal weight, I’ll incorporate strength training to look more toned. 

My ultimate goal weight is 130lbs and I want to be there by the end of August. I can’t wait to see what my body will look like then. I’m hoping for an hourglass figure!

Anyways, I’ve had a really difficult time personally the last three months and seeing this actually work out for me brings me happiness because it’s one of the only things going well in my life."

I struggle with I think three major issues? The first is anxiety over food. The second is that when I get hungry, I have low tolerance for that feeling of hunger and it turns into panic and then any food is acceptable because I'm just SO hungry (probably from avoiding food all day due to the first issue).

I'm off that medication now.

I've been trying, bit by bit, to shift my eating. First by making it all gluten free (I have celiac), and then slowly by removing processed sugar and high carb low nutrient foods like mac n cheese. That's about as far as I've gotten. I keep an eye on calories but don't measure them diligently though that's my next step. I figured doing things one little bit by one little bit, I could shift them more permanently than by making sweeping stressful changes.

0,"I’m stuck in a very bad cycle, and I don’t know how to get out.

I recently had a very bad relapse of binge eating behavior. Gained a lot of weight very quickly (about 10 lbs in 3 weeks). I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself for the behavior and how my body changed, but the only way I can figure to cope with those feelings, is with even more binge eating!! Which that obviously leads to even more weight gain, which makes me binge more, and so on and so on...

I recently had a very bad relapse of binge eating behavior. Gained a lot of weight very quickly (about 10 lbs in 3 weeks). I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself for the behavior and how my body changed, but the only way I can figure to cope with those feelings, is with even more binge eating!! Which that obviously leads to even more weight gain, which makes me binge more, and so on and so on...

I come back on slightly happier terms :) 

So I've started losing weight again, even if its only a pound it shows that what I'm doing is working, so I'm happy about that.

Also! You'll be glad to know I've started doing way more exercising, doing at least 15000 steps a day and I've also started doing the couch to 5k, which gets me out of the house and running (a little bit of exercise is better than none!)  
I'm eating around 1200 calories a day and tonight, after three weeks of hard work, I'm having a (calorie counted) homemade pizza night, so it feels nice to be able to treat myself!

  
Any advice anyone has would be greatly appreciated but I just wanted to let everyone know. This is the first time in my life after years of struggling with mental health and eating disorders where I actually feel confident that I'm making a positive change.

I'm a 31F who has been steadily losing weight (96.5kg down to 64.3kg) since October 2019. While I'm delighted with my weight loss, recently I've really been lacking with motivation to keep my fitness and workouts up.

As time went on, maybe from 10 to 17 (last year) it was common for me to have a Coke (or any other fizzy drink) somewhere during the day, either lunch of mid afternoon, no matter if I still drank the 2 ice teas.

Last July I cut down on these drinks completely and only drink one or two cans a month, which I found to be a sustainable habit. The problem is that my body has always been accustomed to that much sugar so I spend the day craving it.

Normally I end up going to the supermarket, which is nearby (big problem), two or three times a week to buy sweets (skittles, mentos and all those haribo products, which I don't know the name in English) and end up eating them through the week.

I realise that this is a bad habit but I just can't stop it because I feel a very big urge to go and buy them, especially because nowadays I live with pretty healthy food habits, intermittent fasting, never liked cookies and chocolates.

What would you recommend I do in order to cut down on this unhealthy sugar intake?

About 8 years ago, I posted my [152lbs weight loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/19fpnq/152_lbs_lost_anyone_can_do_it/) here on loseit.  At the time, I had been losing weight for about 2 years.

I just wanted to post an update showing its possible to keep weight loss long term. We have all seen the statistics that most dieters fail and regain most weight.  That statistic alone pushed me to not fail. 

For a little background, I started losing weight in 2010 after being sick and in pain consistently. I had an honest conversation with myself that the only thing I hadn't tried was a healthy lifestyle. I lost most of the weight simply restricting my calories and going for 20 minute walks a few times per week. 

As for the progress, the top row of photos are between 2009-2012. It took about two years to drop from 309+ lbs to 157 lbs (my highest verifiable recorded weight was 309, but I'm sure it was higher). 

The bottom row of photos show my progress from 2013-2020 as my love for bodybuilding and then powerlifting took over.  I actually sit around 200lbs these days, but its a much leaner 200. 

I will say that eating is forever a struggle for me.  Moderation is the hardest. I can operate under a strict diet well, or I can be totally unleashed and eat everything.  Its hard to have a middle ground for me. It does get easier to make better choices and live a certain way with time, but the desire to eat everything in sight never has gone away for me. 

There are always ups and downs. Changes in jobs, relationships, stress, and holidays have always impacted my weight.  The trick is being able to catch those trends and reverse course instead of giving up. 

I don't have any particular special knowledge to impart, but that investing in yourself is what you are doing by taking charge of your health, and its the best investment you can make. Being removed by this much time makes it feel like I'm looking at a different person entirely, its hard to remember everything from then now as I tend to rather look forward than back. 

If anyone has any particular questions or anything they want answered, I'll do my best to reply.  To the one question I always get: Yes, I have loose skin, had some removed and still have a ton. But no, I would never use that as a reason to not lose weight.",152 lbs down and maintained for a decade,"152 lbs down and maintained for a decade Greetings all,

Hi everyone,  

I have read into multiple posts / articles regarding plateaus and despite the information given I still can’t overcome mine.  The last time I lost a lb was about 6 weeks ago.  

For food it’s eggs (on whole wheat) in the morning if not oats.  Lunch/Dinner are generally the same: Chicken, broccoli, eggs again, mixed veggies, occasional rice, etc

Snacks/In-between meals include: Eggos, peanut butter toast, fruit.

Calories remain just above/below 2000 according to MFP.

For exercise I do a 4 day upper/lower split and I am seeing somewhat slow increase in strength there.  Cardio is 5-7 days a week.  A minimum of 20-30 mins of steady state.

I have weighed my food / counted my kcals better and I know this is partially body acclimation due to the way my clothes feel but I can’t help but feel I am lacking.  I as far away from processed foods as possible and I have had maybe 3 cheat meals in the past two months.  I don’t eat much in terms of sugar.  I swapped soda with zero sugar and focused primarily on water.  I did away with coffee (till I can find a recipe to make it sweet/taste good without 40g of sugar lol).  No sweets or anything.  Anyways any feedback at all is appreciated.  I’m somewhat patient but I want to make sure I am optimizing as much as possible.  

Thank you all in advance.",Plateau: M29 / 230lbs / 6’ - Help if possible.,"Plateau: M29 / 230lbs / 6’ - Help if possible. SW: 260lbs (Oct 2020) / CW 200lbs / GW 190-200lbs / 6ft

0,"25(F) SW: 276lbs CW: 207lbs GW: 175lbs - So I started this wonderful weight loss journey a couple years ago. I would lose 20-30 lbs, maintain for a few months, gain 5 lbs back and then lose another 20-30 lbs just to do it all over again. Its not been a bad journey, actually it was really great once I genuinely started understanding how food and nutrients work in your body. However, I also had a good support system that I would share my accomishments and buy new clothes with, ect ect. This time though, I feel far more alone in it having relocated to a new state 2 months ago for my husband's work.

Well, I maintained my weight for a solid year before deciding right before COVID really hit that I was going to start losing again. I counted my calories, I hit my proteins, carbs and fat and exceeded my steps everyday and not a single budge. Worse, I was starting to feel really sick and tired all the time. Frustrated and angry, I said ""F*ck it, you look fine"" and threw myself a little tantrum - 10 months later, my beautiful son was born. 

He turned 4 months this past Tuesday and I was fortunate to come out of my long and arduous pregnancy (and 32 hr labor) only 10 lbs heavier than I went in. I decided last month, when I quit breastfeeding that it was time and I joined a gym again. 

Today, I stand 15.8 lbs lighter and just got home from my first step aerobics class which I will be attending every Wednesday (cardio on M/F and Yoga on Sundays). A friend referred me to reddit for the stock market threads and I ended up here, been lurking for a few days and decided I love the atmosphere. I hope this will make a fine replacement for the support I had back home.

0,"So as I’ve started this journey I never realized how bad my relationship with food really was. I knew I consumed too much junk and gained the weight ofc, but I never noticed I didn’t share. At all. Not with my son, or my husband. I’d go so far as to hide things and my son was told no so often he’d stop asking and get visibly down any time I had junk food and he didn’t. 

I never realized it until I fell off the wagon this weekend. I bought some junk food. I ate some, but not all. I was so proud that even tho I wasn’t eating what I should, I wasn’t binging. Then my husband pointed out that I had even shared with my son and how giddy he got. 

Honestly it hit me hard. I don’t think he knew I hadn’t realized because I straight up stared at him and asked “I never shared with him?”  Looking back I could remember getting half a dozen boxes of junk I would eat in an hour sitting (no I’m not exaggerating) and I couldn’t remember sharing a single piece with him. 

But now I’m not only not binging (okay so some chips and a couple Oreos still aren’t good in place of a meal but it wasn’t two family size packages of both at least), I’m also sharing what I get. Healthy and not.

I was in a rough time in my life where my looks were my biggest insecurity including my body fat. I received so much wonderful feedback and although my journey took a while with lots of faults it's in so much of a better place now. I'm now standing at around 128 pounds and for the most part, I'm content with the way I look. I still strive for more but it's great knowing I'm at least doing something to create a change.

When I first began, I realized that my daily diet before thinking about what I ate was junk food, junk food, and more junk food. I went days realizing just how hungry I was when I cut out unnecessary snacks because those had always been my main sources of food. Over time, however, I've learned to cook on my own! I now create dinners for my family of different cuisines and styles of things I find online. Bless my parents' wonderful hearts who've helped me this whole time with dealing my mad food ingredient shopping sprees haha.

For the most part, I made sure to keep up a lot with what I ate. At times it was rough but I wish I had told myself counting calories every day or restraining myself so much to the point where I'd chew up food and spit it out was just not the best way to go through with things. At the moment, I'm able to eat what I enjoy while making sure to keep food proportions and better options in mind. Want a snack? Instead of grabbing that chocolate switch it up with a favorite fiber bar brand or a banana! It was as simple as that but I had a junk food addiction for so long. Besides food though, I'm most proud of my workouts. I've completed a 28-day Chloe Ting workout program and I'm now able to jog a whole mile without stops!

So exactly 1 year ago I made a post called  [1 year, 40lbs down and swore I'd only take 2 pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/fd38hg/1_year_40lbs_down_and_swore_id_only_take_2/) and I thought to myself, after the year that we've all had, I'd like to do a follow up.

Where should I begin... well a lot has happen to all of us in the last 365 days. We had to stop going out as much as we did, businesses closed their doors, our offices told us to work from home, our homes became our offices, and some of us haven't seen co-workers in almost a year. Through all this I learned quite a few things about myself.

1: I'm an extrovert and I need the energy of other people around me. This not seeing people or going out really took a toll on my mental health.

2: Long walks with my pup are a doable thing during lunch and a really good way for me to destress.

3: A lot of hard work went down the drain due to over eating and snacking because the kitchen is 15 feet away.

4: I love cooking now that I have more time for it and trying all new recipes from around the world. I've expanded my mid west pallet far beyond what I ever thought it could be.

I'm currently 157lbs which means I'm 2lbs away from my goal weight. Looking at my pictures I'm guessing some of that is muscle but still I kept at it and results are slow but they exist. I was scared to take a picture of myself this afternoon after looking in the mirror but in the end I thought this is life, my life and I am happy that I didn't slip complete back into old habits and back up to 200lbs. So here is my visual documentation of life. (**NSFW Shirtless**) [https://imgur.com/a/i3cRDGO](https://imgur.com/a/i3cRDGO)

I am god damn proud of you all for keeping up with your routines, your awareness of lifestyle choices and dedication.

I have lost about 35lbs over the course of about 9 months now and I wanted to make sure I was losing weight at a healthy pace. I usually eat 1600 calories a day and always make room for treats within those calories and go for walks a couple times a week. I have gotten a couple comments about my weight loss recently that made me worried. Someone commented that I had lost too much weight and another mentioned that I am anorexic and that kind of threw me off. The only thing that worries me a little is being a little obsessed with watching weight loss videos, what I eat in a day, etc. I just wanted to make sure the changes I've made haven't been to drastic. I feel so much better than I used to and the calories I fit in a day feel like enough to keep me satisfied and I'm getting close to my goal.

I usually eat 1600 calories a day and always make room for treats within those calories and go for walks a couple times a week. I have gotten a couple comments about my weight loss recently that made me worried. Someone commented that I had lost too much weight and another mentioned that I am anorexic and that kind of threw me off. The only thing that worries me a little is being a little obsessed with watching weight loss videos, what I eat in a day, etc. I just wanted to make sure the changes I've made haven't been to drastic. I feel so much better than I used to and the calories I fit in a day feel like enough to keep me satisfied and I'm getting close to my goal. Thoughts?"
0,I'm [25F] on a weight loss journey and it's been a couple months I've lost a good bit of weight but I'm not near my goal weight... A couple of people have already started to notice it and commented but today in particular a coworker was asking me in detail if I've lost weight and what am I doing to lose weight and what my goals are etc. I just said thank you and I've been eating healthy that's all. Kept it short. I just feel so awkward because I'm very introverted and shy especially when it comes to these things. I really don't want to be talking about myself and especially not about my weight loss journey I find it personal. My question is.. How do you handle comments the right way and is it normal that I feel this strange about it?,How do you handle comments?,How do you handle comments?

This past year sucked. I'm sure that's the understatement of the century. But it's been extra hard for me. I had just moved to a new city, lost my job, and have just been generally depressed and anxious. I was 148 when I moved here, which was 10 lbs up from where I wanted to be. But now, I see I'm headed back in a dangerous direction. 

I've been 200 lbs several times in my life and I never want to go back to that point. I told myself I was going to turn myself around when I got to 155. And then again at 160. But I'm having a hard time giving a fuck. I'm accountable to no one. I don't even care enough about myself to feel like I owe it to myself. So I realized I need to actually interact with people who remind me about the importance of what I'm doing.

Hi guys. I started taking getting the quarantine weight off and picking my healthy habits back up at the end of January. I had been working out since December, but I really buckled down for february. 

I lost 15 lbs. 

And now my period is M.I.A 

I'm concerned it's because of the weight loss? Am I working out too much? I don't know. I was afraid my copper IUD had failed, so I took a pregnancy test today: negative. 

I'm not sure what my course of action next should be. I eat 1200 a day which is only a 400 calorie deficit for sedentary at my height. I work out 45-60 min Mon-Fri.

I started my weight loss journey back in April of 2020 after babysitting for a friend and using her scale to weigh myself because it had been years since I had done so. I had weighed in at 200.8, 25lbs heavier than the last time I remembered weighing myself. I always told myself I would never get to 200lbs but here I was, .8 over 200lbs. 

Immediately I started trying to lose weight, but I knew from my high school experiences that fad diets just didn’t work for me. I had to change my entire lifestyle as a whole in order for my weight loss to be successful. Due to the pandemic, I was not working and this acted as a blessing for me. I went for walks everyday, I was cooking all my meals at home. My biggest issue was my diet. I had years and years of stuffing myself with fast food and processed junk and I really wanted to put most of the focus on my eating habits and creating sustainable meals for myself to prevent over eating. I struggle with food a lot so rather than forcing myself to completely change my diet and keep up with regular exercise, I did more leisurely activities like going for walks and bike rides so I didn’t have too much pressure on myself. Slowly I would see a pound lost, and another, and another. It was a slow process but I didn’t care, I was making successful changes and I was so proud. By the end of the year, I was at 181.4. 

Now, -19.4lbs in 8 months may not seem like a huge deal. I definitely could have lost more. But this was the LONGEST I had ever stuck to a “diet” in my entire life. I had not gained the weight back, I had maintained the loss and that was incredible to me. 

I, like many others, suffer from SAD. Oct-Mar can be rough for me. Particularly this year has been bad. But guess what? I have still maintained my weight loss while only fluctuating by about 5lbs. (depending on the time of the month) and I am still so amazed at myself that almost a year later I have still maintained that 19.4lb loss. That, along with learning to love who I am throughout this last year, has been my biggest accomplishment in my entire life. 

While I still have a ways to go, this is a reminder to myself and anybody else out there who is struggling with their weight and feeling like they could have lost more from when they started to now, what you have done for yourself is amazing and you deserve to be proud of the changes you have made in your life regardless of if you could have lost more. 

Maintaining my weight during the toughest time of the year for my mental health has been the biggest win to date in my journey. While I was so close to giving up because I felt like I could have done more, I am reminding myself that what I have done is create a successful mentality towards myself and towards food.

Long time lurker here, but I wanted to add my story and journey the past year through lockdown!

My weight loss journey has been sporadic over the past four years. I was at my heaviest in 2018 where I was around 230 pounds due to overeating from constant jabs from my coworkers that I was too skinny. After I gained weight, those same coworkers made fun of me for having gained weight. This hurt my self-esteem pretty severely. I eventually left that position, which was one I had strived for since childhood.

With a cratered self-esteem and a lull in employment in 2019, I tried to drop some pounds and get fit. It didn’t work too well. I focused too much on cardio and lifting and not enough on creating a strict diet. I was famished most nights and due to the deficit from an hour of cardio plus lifting while eating 1200 calories. I quickly lost 20 pounds. After two months of this, I began overeating and put back on 5 of those pounds.

I decided this didn’t work for me. I wanted to get muscle. I wanted to be thinner. I wanted to stop doing so much cardio. 

And that’s what I did.

I almost completely cut out cardio in 2020. Instead, I focused on flexibility, form, and “jumping rope.” That’s in quotes because I didn’t own an actual jump rope until Christmas. I was around 210 at the start of this time

From March until October, I focused on eating 2000 calories with macros of Protein &gt; Fat &gt; Carbs. I hadn’t restricted myself on food and I’ve eaten dirty almost the entire time. Taco Bell, Popeyes, Chick-fil-A or some random take out around 7 times a month. The other days were a protein with veggies and a legume or other carb. My favorite preparation was a dry rub on a cheap cut of steak which was reverse seared and finished with a searing in the pan.

November, I am starting my cut around 195. At the end of the month, I am at 200. My SO and I got a CostCo membership and I may or may not have eaten a 40 count of Takis in 5 days before eating an entire bag of cheese in the middle of the night to avoid it from spoiling.

I restarted my cut December 1st where I followed a [routine by /u/LukeatanPeninsula to the T.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/3cudaa/cutting_101/) in my modest home gym of a power rack, a bar, 1 pair of 10,25,35,45 bumpers, and a bench.

Long time lurker here, but I wanted to add my story and journey the past year through lockdown!

My weight loss journey has been sporadic over the past four years. I was at my heaviest in 2018 where I was around 230 pounds due to overeating from constant jabs from my coworkers that I was too skinny. After I gained weight, those same coworkers made fun of me for having gained weight. This hurt my self-esteem pretty severely. I eventually left that position, which was one I had strived for since childhood.

With a cratered self-esteem and a lull in employment in 2019, I tried to drop some pounds and get fit. It didn’t work too well. I focused too much on cardio and lifting and not enough on creating a strict diet. I was famished most nights and due to the deficit from an hour of cardio plus lifting while eating 1200 calories. I quickly lost 20 pounds. After two months of this, I began overeating and put back on 5 of those pounds.

I’m a 5’11 man in my 20s weighing around 244 and I absolutely hate how I look when I check the mirror, or how I feel with my exercise. 

The start of my weight gain dates back to my senior year of high school, when I was in the best shape I had ever been in. During my senior sports season, I tore my ACL (along with many other ligaments) and quickly fell into a deep depression from it. For that summer I was nearly unable to walk after surgery, of course gaining weight and losing muscle over time. 

Then came college and the “Freshman 15” which I soon learned wasn’t a myth, and then the pandemic nearly a year after. After the injury and weight gain, i struggled immensely with finding motivation to get back into my workout routines, be it pain from the knee, pushing other priorities over top of it, or something else all together. Then at the beginning of quarantine for me in the early summer, I had an opportunity to work out more as there wasn’t much for me to do back home, losing 20 pounds rather quickly and on track to where I wanted to be. But I soon was afflicted with another lower body injury that sidelined be for a few weeks and took my motivation with it. 

Flash forward to now, the heaviest I’ve ever been, and the most out of shape I’ve ever been. My lifestyle now is one I know is bad and one I need to fix, as it’s hurting my self confidence and motivation to do anything else within my life. The ideal goal would be to lose 40 pounds at least, get near 200 or just under it. I know what to do for workouts and how to workout once I’m in the gym, but I’ve never Struggled so much with starting and keeping my motivation going.

I guess I wanted to ask you for your own experiences and strategies you took when nearing this part. I feel I have systems in place, and I try to honor them and follow them but it seems like I still can't shake the feleing of failure :c"
0,"TL/DR: I haven’t lost any weight in 9 days despite expecting 2+ lbs of weight loss just like I was doing for the previous 5 weeks. I’m not familiar with how much my body weight can fluctuate, even in the middle of a diet, and need some clarification on that.

Here’s the full story: So I began a full-fledged diet back in January (I’m a 5’10 male). I was 230 lbs on January 15th. Started eating less than 1800 calories a day. During the first 5 weeks, I averaged about 2 lbs/week weight loss (I weighed in at 219 lbs on Feb. 22). Since then, it’s been about a week and a half, during that week, I went back up to 224, then 222, and now 219 as of this morning. Admittedly, I do not consistently weight in at the same time every day. Nothing has changed except that I further restricted my diet to 1500 cal/day about 3 weeks ago (meaning I should be losing more weight). How has there been no average weight loss? It feels really discouraging with how much work I’m putting into living a more healthy lifestyle.

I knew that weight fluctuations were a thing, but by how much do they usually fluctuate? 

Does anyone else have a similar story to how they ran into a weight “wall” so-to-speak? Did you overcome it?

Hi all! I have been using LoseIt for almost a year now and have always used their ""Standard"" when selecting a calorie budget type. My budget has been around 1250-1300 since I started, though there are days I definitely go over (I can't resist a glass of wine). 

I just saw there is another option under Budget titled ""Personalized Adaptive"". It sounds really similar to Standard. Has anyone used this before? Did you see any changes? Positive or negative?

When I switched to Personalized Adaptive it bumped my calorie budget up to 1700. Also, I have been stagnant at 130 lbs since November. I know that it is CICO but why would it give me 400 more calories for the same .5 lbs per week goal? Thanks!",Standard v. Personalized Adaptive in LoseIt App,"Standard v.

I have no one to share this with so I’m sharing it here. I’m 20 pounds away from my goal weight. I started logging everything I ate but did nothing with that information for a very long time. Just ate how I ate and logged it... this winter my personal life changed immensely, and to distract myself from my world falling apart I started eating healthier... only started exercising a month ago. I feel like I have kicked it into high gear, like 100% effort like 2 weeks ago and I’m so excited to see what happens now.

Beginning in November I began actually making an effort to eat under 1500 calories a day, but still eating whatever I wanted. I use to have a few drinks every day (seltzers or beers or wine) and started drinking only occasionally around this time.

January is when I began only cooking for one (not including my son, who isn’t on my eating plan) so I stopped getting takeout during the week (previously I would get takeout a few times a week) and eating no more than 1500 calories a day strictly, usually around 1400. I was still very sedentary. Oh, and I started drinking green tea a few times a day (about 4 cups a day).

February is when I began exercising about 5 times a week. I am generally speaking very sedentary in my day to day life, only walking my dog (English bulldog so she’s pretty sedentary too) and working from home. I started running (I’m slow, running about a 12 minute mile in my very hill-y area in SF) 3 times a week and doing some kettlebell workouts and resistance bands on my own 4 times a week or so.

In the last month, to now, I’m feeling more energetic than I have since I was a kid. I use to be tired all the time. I don’t feel hungry in between meals. It was hard to train myself to not let myself pig out on whatever after work after eating light all day long. I feel more in control and capable than ever. The personal life stuff is still crushing to me but every day it’s a little easier. It’s starting to fade into the rear view.... instead of being something I fixated on daily.

So by that 7 month marker I had given myself, I had lost 9.5kg/20 lbs and gained a LOT of strength. I was pretty pleased, despite not making my goal. I kept at it. 

Then came a 6 week course of prednisone to help my Crohn's. I gained 5kg/10 lbs in under 2 weeks. That shocked me, and I was very careful about what I ate after that. I didn't gain any more. 

Them came winter. Slippery sidewalks, darkness, lots of snow, cold weather. Our home gym is in an unheated garage. I stopped working out. Started restricting calories for a nice, slow loss of about a pound a week. Went plant-based until my Crohn's complained. I'm still figuring that out. 

But now it's almost Spring. Sticking to it through the year despite setbacks has worked out. I changed my plan as circumstances dictated, and kept going. Stayed positive.

______________________________________________________

Hi guys,

This is my first post here, but I do follow and read other people’s posts for insight. So I started out at about 200 lbs. back in September 2019. Much of the weight started falling off once my IUD expired and my appetite started to settle down, and now (Mar 2021) I weigh about 147 lbs, but has slowed down a lot now that I am smaller. I am almost to my weight from high school, which is cool I guess.

But honestly, I like how I look. I am losing weight slowly, but surely. I got to my goal size (a medium or 8/10 US size). I'm 
still a bit soft so I am working on lifting when I go to the gym now in addition to my normal 30m-1hr of cardio. Perhaps I need to work on body recomposition instead?

However, according to my smart scale, my BMI is about 26. Overweight by a few points. 

BMI calculators say my weight range is supposed to between 115-126. My vitals are fine, and I have always had normal blood pressure, even at my largest. My doctor has not mentioned any problems nor has he brought up any concerns. 

I guess what I am feeling conflicted about is whether or not I should keep going. I don’t really *want* to have to keep eating 1300 cals. But I almost feel guilty when I eat at maintenance. Like I’ve ruined something that's been in progress for so long.

______________________________________________________

Hi guys,

This is my first post here, but I do follow and read other people’s posts for insight. So I started out at about 200 lbs. back in September 2019. Much of the weight started falling off once my IUD expired and my appetite started to settle down, and now (Mar 2021) I weigh about 147 lbs, but has slowed down a lot now that I am smaller. I am almost to my weight from high school, which is cool I guess.

But honestly, I like how I look. I am losing weight slowly, but surely. I got to my goal size (a medium or 8/10 US size). I'm 
still a bit soft so I am working on lifting when I go to the gym now in addition to my normal 30m-1hr of cardio. Perhaps I need to work on body recomposition instead?

However, according to my smart scale, my BMI is about 26. Overweight by a few points. 

BMI calculators say my weight range is supposed to between 115-126. My vitals are fine, and I have always had normal blood pressure, even at my largest. My doctor has not mentioned any problems nor has he brought up any concerns. 

I guess what I am feeling conflicted about is whether or not I should keep going. I don’t really *want* to have to keep eating 1300 cals. But I almost feel guilty when I eat at maintenance. Like I’ve ruined something that's been in progress for so long. 

Also, truth be told, I really don't feel like buying new clothes lol. But I keep wondering, am I too fat? Do I need to keep going?"

I have selected 13 meals or dishes that I keep making over and over that should be compatible with most diets. I'll include the ingredients list, nutritional information along with other hints. Some recipes are vegetarian/vegan, others not so much.

Post your favourite healthy recipes here to share with the rest of the loseit community! Recipes don't have to fit this week's theme at all, they should just be something that you can eat reasonably frequently while actively losing weight.

Due to the spirit of the sub, please try to include the calorie and nutritional information if at all possible. MyFitnessPal has awesome recipe calculators you can use!

For the most part, I target my meals to have a component in the 350-550 kcal range. My lunch and dinner tend to be right around 400 kcal each and dinner can be a bit heavier, or include a side dish to bring the calories up a bit. When I was eating 1650 kcal/day the breakdown was roughly 400/400/600/250 for breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks.

Anyhow: enough background on to the recipes!

**Roasts**

Pork Tenderloin is something I tend to cook once every two weeks or so. It's a relatively lean cut of meat and generally comes in 1-1.5 lb portions and at 150 kcal/3 oz portion each whole 20 oz tenderloin is about 1,000 kcal.

During the warmer months I'll do it on the grill and serve with a salad, but in the winter months I will usually roast it in the oven and also make some roast potatoes and Brussels sprouts. 

Here's a single sheet pan recipe to get them all done in around the same time about 20-25 minutes in the oven. https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/sheet-pan-pork-tenderloin-and-potatoes/

Note that I scaled down the portions to what I usually use and mixed the sprouts in with the potatoes.

Pork
- 1.25 lbs pork tenderloin [1000 kcal]
- 1/4 cup brown sugar [200 kcal]
- 2 tsp garlic 
- 2 tbsp reduced sodium soy sauce
- 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika optional

Potatoes and Sprouts
- 0.5 lbs baby red and/or gold potatoes, halved [180 kcal]
- 1 tbsp olive oil [180 kcal]
- 1 oz grated parmesan cheese [120 kcal]
- 0.5 lbs brussels sprouts [100 kcal]
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 tsp Italian blend herbs
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder

All in this is a 450 kcal [29/17/44 g carbs/fat/protein] meal if you make this four portions. My partner and I will usually cut half of the tenderloin and put away half of the sides for another day once it's all cooked. It reheats better if the meat is not pre-sliced and it's dinner for another day. 

You can easily scale up the vegetables if you want more volume or are targeting higher calorie levels. Doubling the potatoes and sprouts adds another ~250 kcal. I also don't mind adding something like some simple steamed broccoli or green beans to the mix or a green salad.

I gained back 10 lbs after not eating so well while working out. I believe I gained muscle since my arm fat has shrunk by a lot, I was surprised at that too. It only took three weeks! Imagine how much smaller it will be in six weeks. I can’t wait.

Back in January my waist/hips and even legs looked super skinny. Now that I gained 10 lbs I always look bloated again. I hope by drinking more smoothies and slim fast will shred off the pounds quickly but it’s already been stuck at 275 for a week now.

Haven’t had the energy to make it but I will today since I need the energy. I picked up two flavors of energy drinks, Those tiny pocket sized ones so I hope they will help too.

Back story.  In my final year of high school at the beginning of 2019 I was 290 pounds I started doing mostly strength training not too much cardio about 10 minutes 3 times a week for about 10 months. I was trying a protein based diet but I didn't have the money to hit 200+g of protein per day often it would be about a 100g.I was seeing results I got down to 238 pounds.

I'm now 2nd year college student.
Since the pandemic start with gyms being closed and school I'm now back to 290 pounds.

With alot more money now than before I thought I can eat healthier get some supplements and hit those 200+g of protein, go to the gym workout harder, track the calories and I'll see results at a faster pace than before.
I've been working out for about 2 months now lifting heavier, doing more sets, 40 minutes cardio 3 times a week.
And I'm still the same weight.
I don't know what's going on. Am I gaining muscle and losing fat at the same rate?( Which should be impossible).

0,"Hi guys, thought I'd post here and get some opinions. 

F(38) 5'2"", SW(183), CW(162), GW (125).  I've been eating low carb and calorie counting since December 2020. I had lost 20lbs as of early February. My daily calorie intake was between 1200-1300 and I went to the gym a few times a week and walked briskly on the treadmill/elliptical. I started reading about intermittent fasting and then water fasting (not promoting here!) and thought I'd give it a try to maybe speed my weight loss along. 

I ended up eating way too few calories (like 500) for about a week, then I fasted for four days. This is NOT my usual approach and I felt unhealthy doing it, but I wanted to try it for myself and see what it was like. That's a whole other post...

Not surprisingly I did lose more weight, got down to 158 lbs, but of course my body wasn't happy and I overate the next three days. I say overate, however I'm positive (as I've been tracking calories for months now tracked these) that those calories didn't remotely add up to the calories I didn't eat for that two week period of super low calorie/fasting. 

Okay, now to my question. I'm back to my 1200-1300 calories/day, normal low-carb whole foods that I was doing. But now this seems to be making me gain weight, as I'm back up to 162. Do you guys think my body is just evening out again after all the fluctuation? Or did I mess up my metabolism and now to start losing again I need to eat less or more?

F(38) 5'2"", SW(183), CW(162), GW (125).  I've been eating low carb and calorie counting since December 2020. I had lost 20lbs as of early February. My daily calorie intake was between 1200-1300 and I went to the gym a few times a week and walked briskly on the treadmill/elliptical. I started reading about intermittent fasting and then water fasting (not promoting here!) and thought I'd give it a try to maybe speed my weight loss along. 

I ended up eating way too few calories (like 500) for about a week, then I fasted for four days. This is NOT my usual approach and I felt unhealthy doing it, but I wanted to try it for myself and see what it was like. That's a whole other post...

Not surprisingly I did lose more weight, got down to 158 lbs, but of course my body wasn't happy and I overate the next three days. I say overate, however I'm positive (as I've been tracking calories for months now tracked these) that those calories didn't remotely add up to the calories I didn't eat for that two week period of super low calorie/fasting. 

Okay, now to my question. I'm back to my 1200-1300 calories/day, normal low-carb whole foods that I was doing. But now this seems to be making me gain weight, as I'm back up to 162. Do you guys think my body is just evening out again after all the fluctuation? Or did I mess up my metabolism and now to start losing again I need to eat less or more? I've read so much conflicting 'science' and I just want to get back to a slow, steady, healthy weight loss pattern. Thanks so much!"

I have a BMI of 20,4 (170cm, 59 kg) which theoretically would mean my weight is okay  but i am super fat!

0,"One thing I often do when I'm serious about losing weight is cooking a big pot of something healthy and then eating it over the course of 2-3 days.

So either I have to eat exactly the same portion size every time or I have to re-do the recipe every time. When it's something complex with lots of ingredients this obviously explodes the effort required to track my calories so it's quite annoying.

But weight wise, ive weighed the same over these past 30 days (weighing myself every 3 days at same time in the moning) Previously in this time period i would have seen at least a 2kg loss (with water weight flucatuations).

0,"Hello, I have question about my cut, which I started 5 weeks ago and is going painfully slow despite 2,100 calories a day.

I am 38 years old, 5'10"" (178 cm), workout out six times a week.

I started 5 weeks ago at 188 lb. (85.2 kg) with about 17-20% bodyfat. I started at 2,500 cal/day but was making slow progress, losing only about 0.5 lb (0.22 kg) a week. So, I gradually lowered each week and I am currently at 2,100 calories a day but still only losing 0.5 to 0.7 lb (0.3 kg) a week.

I've heard that 1.0 to 1.5 lb (0.45 to 0.68 kg) a week is a good rate of weight loss but I have not even been able to break 1.0 lb lost a week yet.

I work out six times a week. 3 sessions of full body weight lifting, 2 sessions of high intensity cardio (boxing, hill sprints etc.), and 1 slow steady state cardio session for about an hour. So, my work rate is high.

Is 2,100 calories too low for someone at my age, height/weight, and activity level? It seems really low to me. Yet, I am able to complete my hard works outs. I am still gaining strength in the gym. I do not feel week or wasted. I only have minor to moderate hunger at night, sometimes none at all.

However, I don't want to cut forever and this progress seems painfully slow.

One possible explanation is that my body is going under a recomp. I do seem more defined and a bit bigger in the mirror, but not that much (could be my mind playing tricks on me). My strength continues to go up in the gym. I am an experienced athlete, but in terms of weight lifting I am definitely deconditioned. Plus, even at my best, my lifts never went past ""intermediate"" numbers. So, I guess it might be possible.

And I don't mean that as a code word for looking fat, I mean ***pain***, to where the only relief is either lying flat or bending over (presumably for the way those positions move things around in there) while waiting for gas tabs to kick in. I had thought that it might be a symptom of too high fiber, despite having the same foods for months without issue and was set to give up favorites like oatmeal, chia, flax.

Tonight, I had the same issues, no oats, chia, or flax in sight, plenty of water all day long, with some gum earlier in the day. I'm not sure why it suddenly occurred to me it might be the gum, but I looked up the ingredients and apparently artificial sugar alcohols can cause these issues in some people. 

Now, I can't say with 100% certainty, of course. I'm not going to run a randomized control trial, but I think it's likely. 

I'll add that, before chewing this gum, I've never been one to consume stuff with artificial sugar and have actively avoided it, so it's not something my body is accustomed to dealing with.

I hope my bacteria friends aren't too pissed at me and will return to normal eventually. &gt;.&lt;",I am never recommending sugar-free gum to anyone again!,"I am never recommending sugar-free gum to anyone again! A while ago, I decided to start chewing sugar-free gum to keep my mouth occupied when I wanted to snack out of boredom. Plus, xylitol is good for your teeth. Seemed like a win-win.

I 25f 5ft 3inches SW 237.6 CG 185 just weighed in at 226lbs . Yes its only 0.8lbs.


 But my excuse is last weekend i ate within my calories a take out which made it into two meals . It was fried and high in salt . Also last week we had bad weather so for safety reasons couldnt walk dogs as much .


Overall im still proud as i still lost weight and all i aim for is 1lb a week so i was close .


Im still doing at home workouts three times a week still dont like it when will i like exercise???



Apart from said takeaway iv really limited my salt i still do use salted butter as SO prefers it plus i only use a tiny amount . 



Since starting 6weeks ago as well as drinking just water and lots of it . Iv been trying to eat slower which is a huge help .


Im trying to think of some small goals for march but im a bit stumped atm . 

One thing i am going to do is slowly buy new clothes that when i lose weight i wont mind being baggy . As i want cute clothes now not later .

0,"(For reference I’m 16, 156cm/5’1”, 52.5kg/115lbs. My starting weight was 60kg/132lbs, and I eat around 1100-1300 cals a day, and burn 200-400)

so I’ve been eating a clean, vegetarian diet for the past couple of months. It would be a completely vegan diet if it weren’t for the occasional boiled egg I eat and the fact that I’m obsessed with cottage cheese. Any who, I ate a chocolate muffin and within about three minutes my heart rate started picking up and I got kinda shaky, then the nausea and stomach cramps set in. I feel really clogged up and I hate how the fat, sugar, and oil is just sitting in my stomach and I can’t do anything about it. 

I know there wasn’t anything spoilt in the muffins as I made them myself and nothing was off in the ingredients, and there wasn’t any milk in it that would’ve made me sick (I’m lactose intolerant). 

I’m just wondering why this is? I’ve felt dizzy and nauseous after eating certain things before, but I’ve noticed now that the longer I have gone eating healthy, the more frequent I have started to feel sick from unhealthy food. It first started with really really unhealthy food- like fried chips, but now it’s crept up on things like pasta, or even marinated tofu (although plain tofu is okay).  

I’m really thinking of converting to a raw vegan diet, as eating the foods that fall into that category are the only things that agree with my stomach and don’t leave me clogged up, shaky, and sick. 

I guess I just hate how my stomach can pick up every ounce of oil and fat that reaches it now. It’s like I don’t even have to read the nutritional labels of food anymore to see if there’s saturated/trans fatty acids in it— I can just tell by how disgusting and greasy my stomach feels. 

Has anyone ever experienced this before? Is there a gastrointestinal issue I’ve developed to explain this digestion problem? Will a supplement be able to fix this?

I have above average amount of excess fat since my kindergarten days. I had no control of what I was eating, and even had no clue what my problem with health is. That obscurity ended at my age of 14. I was desperate about it and just accepting it with shame for three years. Now, at the age of 17, I've just started to gather any sort of weightloss information. So I figured out my basal metabolic rate, started counting calories, started doing a little bit of exercises everyday. And I have feeling that I do exercises wrong. Every morning I do exercises on my stationary bike. But only for 20-25 minutes. I heard that you have to do cardio for like one hour to have atleast tiny weightloss progress, but even 25 minutes are enough to make me extremely sweaty like never before (like you doused yourself from water bottle) and make me exhausted for 4-5 hours. Even 10 minutes are enough to make me feel uncomfortable but I don't give up until it gives me a pain in my legs. I usually ride near 5.5 miles. I heard from my friends that they ride like 12-14 miles per day at summertime on their own bicycles. And I am now thinking that I workout for nothing.

0,"Hi guys. Hear me out- I know everything I’m about to say is illogical, but I need to just express my feelings and (hopefully) get some advice/encouragement that will help me shake this feeling. Obligatory “I’m on mobile” disclaimer.

I’m 26f, 235lbs, at only 5’2”. I don’t usually feel huge unless I need to bend down (squat, kneel) or I see myself in a picture or video (who is THAT?!?!?). I know for the sake of my health, I need to lose weight. For the sake of my health and vanity, I WANT to lose weight. 

However... I tend to give up on myself. I’m very all-or-nothing about it, and I also sometimes feel like it’s too late for me. That I missed the window where change was possible. Since I’ll never be 18 or 21 again, what’s the point? I missed my peak years. Why try when I’ve already lost so much time? What if my bad habits have already done irreparable harm to my health? If I might die sooner anyways, why not eat the Taco Bell again today?

I know that’s crazy. Nothing will ever change if I don’t change, and a bad day or moment doesn’t mean a bad eternity. I know I’m still privileged- there are plenty of people older, heavier, and in worse health than me that are committed to making a change. I just struggle to remember that and to get myself into the right state of mind to make changes myself. 

So, fellow redditors, if you have any sympathies, advice, encouragement, or anecdotes- please share them.

I struggle with depression and anxiety I am medicated for both.

I also have Hashimotos Thyroiditis which makes it harder but it's not an excuse.

I’m only 3 weeks in but it’s been a lot easier than I thought it would be. I eat my 3 main meals a day with some kind of 100 cal snack after lunch or after dinner if I need it. I’m kinda hungry at times but it’s been easy to control. Before this I felt like I’d pass out if I didn’t eat every couple of hours or have a constantly full stomach.

As long as it fits into my calorie limit I haven’t had an issue. 

Down 10 pounds already with zero exercise, only cutting calories.

I was counting calories for a couple months but somehow still not losing the weight at the rate I hoped to. I *thought* I was estimating my intake well... then I got a digital food scale and started weighing all my food down to the gram. It helped me realize two things:

\-I am NOT good at eyeballing portions (hahaha). And using measuring cup measurements is not as accurate as I thought!

\-The little bites add up. I'm guilty of grabbing a handful of grapes whenever I walk by the fridge... but that shit adds up over the course of a week/a month.

Target has pretty cheap food scales for less than $20. Definitely worth it.

0," One year ago in March I started doing CICO and increasing my activity level in the hopes of losing weight. I didn’t have a specific goal weight, but I knew that I wanted to be healthier overall. Over the past year I’ve kept at it and managed to lose 50lbs, and I’ve also taken up regularly running and lifting weights.

 Fast forward to 10 days ago, when I found out that I had been exposed to Covid by a member of my household. I quickly developed symptoms, but they never escalated to the point of me needing any medical intervention. I’ve been on the mend for the past week, with hopefully no long term negative health effects.

 When I was actively sick, I had a friend who is a cardiologist checking in with me to keep tabs on my symptoms, just making sure that I didn’t have any reason to worry about my heart health. I had a very proud NSV moment when my friend told me, “you’re such a healthy person, that is really going to help you recover quickly.” She called me a healthy person! I was obese at this time last year! Thanks to my weight loss and active lifestyle, I had great cardiovascular health going into my illness, and I’m recovering faster than I ever expected. I’m taking it slow and monitoring my heart rate as I reintroduce exercise into my routine, which is easier to do since I’ve spent the past year keeping tabs on my heart rate as I’ve become a runner.

 I’m happy to be thinner and to fit into cute clothes, but the real reason I needed to lose weight was for my health. I got lucky with my covid experience, but I also got to reap the rewards of my hard work over the past year. I love and am happy to live in this body.

TLDR: I caught covid, but I never got very sick. My recovery has been fast, and it likely would have been much worse if I had a higher BMI or if I weren’t an active person.

I’m 20 female, and months into my journey and I find that I haven’t been able to get rid of morning bloating, or the bloated look around my lower belly. My waist has gotten significantly smaller along with every other part of my body, but my lower tummy is the problem area. 

I know things like “bloating” and the fact that that’s just probably where I store the most fat are things I should consider. I don’t have a problem with those things, but I just would like to know whether or not it’s just my body or if there’s something I’m doing to not help the situation. I just have that “soft” look and want to tone up and lose the bloated look. 

I’ve lost around 40 pounds and look amazing, but I’m not where I want to be. I’m doing my best in the gym with weight training and cardio, and have been trying to narrow down a few things in my diet that aren’t helping me. I drink a gallon of water a day and this has significantly helped the bloating, but it just seems that area is very stubborn. 

I’m not really into restrictions, BUT if there’s something that is having a certain effect on my body, I would like to evaluate whether or not I need it in my everyday diet. 

I am on my last two ideas of what I think could be the reason I’m always bloated. Either gluten, or diet soda. I’m now going to take turns cutting both out, but I just wanted to post and see if anyone else can relate to the lower belly bloat that won’t go away, or if they can share their expirences with drinking diet soda or eating gluten and have an intolerance they didn’t know about. 

Now I will say, I know soda isn’t healthy, I just use the diet version because it doesn’t mess with my macros and keeps me sane. Any comments are appreciated, sorry if this is a dumb post.

I've been lurking for a while here having been going through my own challenges with mental health, binge eating disorder, and weight fluctuations. I'm a career firefighter so I am in a ""shape"" but throughout life have been a constant binge eater. I carry a lot of extra weight around and it makes me feel very inadequate at my job. I often feel irresponsible and unreliable. 

Daily stress, trauma, and anxiety often take a pretty heavy toll and ever since I've gotten on the job I really struggle with controlling my urge to binge. Over the last year I got covid, double pneumonia, the flu twice, and a back injury, it gave me a lot of time to myself, isolated and alone. Thats what weight loss can feel like to me. 

I'm writing this because I'm finding more courage in opening up about these things. While I am still overeating, the binging has decreased and if I over eat, it's from relatively healthy choices and quality food (I'm I'm pretty decent cook). I'm not looking to lose weight fast or make huge changes, been there, tried that. What I'm having success with is slowly and methodically choosing to make decisions that want lead me down a negative rabbit hole that ends with a $40 binge at the BK Lounge or whatever weapon of fast food choice that's available. 

Tonight was close, but I can happily report that I fought off a potential binge and just made myself some tea instead. I so badly wanted to get in my car and go get food, but I was able to stop myself. It almost didn't work, the internal battle is constant, trying to find excuses, allowing permissions of ""just this once"" or ""tomorrow I'm gonna crush it"", both deals that I've made with myself. This only set myself up for disaster the next day because I would feel like crapola trying to get out of bed or I'd toss and turn with a stomach ache throughout the night. In order to find why I was craving a binge, I had to go inward, understand that I'm feeling anxious, and remember the terrible feeling that comes after binging...it worked. It might seem like something insignificant for many of you who have had so much success and I truly hope to achieve that for myself. For those of you who struggle every day, lurk, and are overwhelmed by how much work there is to do, these thngs are a huge victory. Do the little things, challenge your old programming, cycles and habits...one step at a time.

If you've read this long, thank you for your support and lending me some of your attention. We can all string together healthy decisions and improve our relationship with ourselves and the way in which we treat our bodies!

0,"Friends, I had a lot of feedback from my last post, so I wanted to give you an update.

In late September, I had lost 157 pounds in 12 months. Since then, I have lost an additional 45 pounds. At the time, I had just run my first (virtual) 10K race. I am now signed up for a half marathon for April. On Friday, I ran over 10 miles in 1 hour, 36 minutes.

[(UPDATED PHOTO)](https://ibb.co/42HdKWN)

I have found that it's harder to keep losing weight. Even as I step up the intensity and length of my workouts, I have found it a little more challenging (but not impossible). My body also looks fat. I have loose skin all over my body, which makes me still feel fat at times.

But guys, I have to tell you it's amazing to be down to 218. I still want to lose a little more, and think I still can.

I also want to say something about companies like Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Advocare and others. I am sure they truly believe in their product. I am sure they work for some people. But I believe they have given people the wrong idea about losing weight. There is a cost of entry to those programs (in some cases, a very expensive cost of entry). It gives so many people the idea that if you don't have the money, you can't diet... THIS IS SO WRONG!

Every bit of research out there shows eating a low-calorie, well-balanced diet coupled with regular exercise leads to weight loss. That isn't that hard. I really feel if you just watch what you eat (I have used an app, but pen and paper still works), and compared that to how many calories you burn a day, odds are, you'll become fit.

Anyway, thanks for everyone who supported me. Below, I have attached my post from late September:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/j2z34u/my\_weight\_loss\_journey\_1\_year\_later/](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/j2z34u/my_weight_loss_journey_1_year_later/)

# My weight loss journey 1 year later

June 2, 2019, I waddled my 420-pound body up Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls. My wife and I have taken an annual road trip for our anniversary every year since getting married in 2014. Our 2019 trip was special as it was the first time I had ever spent the night outside of the United States.

I had always been fairly athletic despite my size. I played basketball and tennis almost every day growing up. My diet, however, was horrific. I lived off Hot Pockets and ice cream. But exercising every day at least kept me from ballooning as a teenager.

Then adulthood came, and the perceived time I had for exercise was replaced with work and chores. Leisure no longer felt like a priority.

Walking never felt like a challenge, and the walk from our hotel to the falls wasn’t hateful as it was downhill. But returning from the falls, I was gassed. The simple act of walking had fatigued me to the point that I had to stop. I was shameful.

I had never really felt “unhealthy” until this point.

**Shamers be shaming**

August 3, 2019, was a gut-wrenching day for many of us in the US. That Saturday, I had just taken Jenna’s car to get an oil change. We found out her rear brake lights would not work, and it appeared there were electrical malfunctions. We were planning on replacing her car at the end of the year, so leaning of a potentially expensive electrical issue prompted us to decide on buying a new car.

When I came home, I heard that there was a massacre at the El Paso Walmart. I checked in with our Saturday person at work, and she was going to need some relief at some point (any one who has worked in breaking news understands how draining these massacres are).

After working an unexpected Saturday shift, I went to bed planning on teaching a few classes in the morning and then going to buy Jenna a new car. After briefly falling asleep, I received a text that another massacre happened, this time just 15 miles down the road in Dayton. Having graduated from Wright State and then working at the Dayton Daily News, I had many friends living in that immediate area. My thoughts turned to them as I now had to work another shift, this time in an area I knew quite well.

While reporting on the events taking place in Dayton, some of my tweets went viral. Immediately, some of the responses weren’t about the shooting, but about my weight. There is this huge tragedy happening in Dayton, and my weight was the issue for some on social media.

To be fair to other reporters, this was a new experience for me. For many of my (especially female) colleagues, the vitriol of fat-shamers can be far worse. I am not an on-camera journalist, but for those who are, the shaming can be downright vitriolic. But given the two tragedies going on, it was tough to process this hate I was receiving.

A few weeks later, I watched a segment on Bill Maher’s show about how there should be more fat-shaming in society. It had me thinking that all of those people tweeting at me during another tragic night in our country were the ones who were right, and who am I to judge them?

I decided to get a gym membership. But the very thing that was driving me to get in shape was what was scaring me off. If these fat-shamers are so spiteful online, how much shame will I face at a gym?

Last September, I went for a walk at VOA Park in Butler County, Ohio. The loop there is 1.5 miles. I felt so exhausted just going once around that loop.

I had enough.

I knew I wanted to get into shape.

For several weeks starting around late September 2019, weighing over 420 pounds, I started walking as fast and long as I could. The 1.5-mile walk quickly became 3-mile walks. While I wasn’t seeing results on the scale, I was feeling better mentally.

**Shamers replaced with cheerleaders**

After a few walks, I already ran into a few folks at VOA Park who saw how much of a sweat I was working up, and gave me so much encouragement to keep moving. I never expected to get thumbs up from people. You quickly realize that for every person out there shaming you, there are dozens ready to push you and help you.

As the weather turned colder, I finally worked up the courage to enter a gym. And it’s true about Planet Fitness… it truly is the “No Judgement Zone.”

People there were so wonderful. Hearing people say “good work” was a great affirmation that I was in the right place.

My time spent exercising prompted me to do a lot of research on how to lose weight, and what I could do to drop weight. There are SO MANY diets out there. Which one is right for me?

It seemed the one constant was you have to watch your calories. If you burn more calories than you consume, you’ll lose weight. I am pretty good with numbers and statistics, so I realized that this could be a winner.

So I decided to go with a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. Coupled with exercise, I found myself losing weight QUICKLY. In the month of December alone, I lost 25 pounds.

I have not put anything in my body that I don’t track. I track every calorie I eat. It is a great way to hold oneself accountable.

Last December was when exercising no longer felt like a chore but routine. I was no longer “forcing myself” to exercise, and had to force myself to take a few day off for rest.

This habit of eating 2,000 calories a day and exercising almost every day simply became my routine, and unlike past diets, it felt like this one worked for me. If I wanted to have a cookie, I could, but I had to make up for it somewhere else. My habit of eating a whole package of Oreos quickly disappeared, however. I have bought a few package of cookies since, but it seems they spoil before I get a chance to finish the container.

**Then came COVID**

March 11 started off a good day. My weigh-in had me down 78 pounds since October. I went to the gym and had a good workout on the stair stepper. I then went to work.

Our whole world felt like it changed in one night.

That evening, the NBA suspended the season, President Trump suspended travel between Europe and the US, and Tom Hanks announced he had the coronavirus. It felt like all of a sudden, the coronavirus was going to have a major impact on our way of life for months to come.

Leaving work that night in a bit of a haze, all I wanted to do was stress eat.

I got off at an interstate exit and was about to order a midnight McDonald’s hamburger.

Then when I got to the drive thru, I saw my gym membership dangling from my keys and decided not to undo the effort I put in that day at the gym. So I drove home and opted for a small, more calorie-friendly snack.

In the days to come, I decided to workout from home. I found myself doing step aerobics on a daily basis, thanks to my wife finding a fantastic YouTube channel. I am so thankful for Jenny Ford for her encouragement as she is a great step aerobics instructor. Even though I don’t do step aerobics as often, I plan on doing more as the weather gets colder. It’s a great full-body workout that requires very little equipment. And it doesn’t require going to an indoor gym during a pandemic!

**Becoming a runner**

At the start of 2020, I thought it would be cool to do a 5K. But I didn’t just want to walk one, so I decided if I could go 5Ks in less than 45 minutes, I’d sign up for one. Little did I know the only options for 2020 would be virtual.

I never really thought I’d enjoy running. It never appealed to me.

In May, I tested myself by seeing how fast I could go at the park. It was the first time I had jogged or walked in two months. I crossed the proverbial finish line in less than 40 minutes.

YES!

Time to sign up for a 5K!

It also turns out running is a great way to burn calories. This started to become my daily routine. It also is such a great way to clear the mind. I put on some music and don’t think about work or the ills of the world.

This is also where I picked up more cheerleaders. I never truly planned on documenting my weight loss journey. I thought to myself I am doing this for myself, and not those dreaded fat-shamers.

But I posted some photos of my first runs, and your support was so overwhelming. It truly motivated me to keep going.

On July 3, I ran my first official 5K. Not that I was counting, but my photo from that day had over 200 Facebook likes... more than I got for my wedding. HAHA

It was time for a new challenge: a 10K. I completed my first 10K on September 14 in 1 hour, 11 minutes. A few days later, I set my 5K PR at 29 minutes.

Let’s say beyond the improvement of my physical health, my mental health has improved so much too.

I have felt so fortunate to have my health and fitness back during a time that so many are suffering, I decided to organize a 5K to benefit Feeding America. A small group of friends have joined, and we have already enough participants to contribute nearly 2,500 meals to Feeding America.

If anyone is interested to join, it is on Facebook as the [“Beat COVD, Beat Hunger 5k Fun Run.”](https://www.facebook.com/events/778533599572213)

**What’s next**

As I end my first year of diet and exercise, I can announce I have lost 157 pounds. Even at 263 pounds, I am still considered “obese.” There is more weight I want to lose as I want to continue doing more with running. I have already started planning on running a half marathon in 2021. Nine months ago, even the idea of doing a 5K didn’t feel like a given.

I understand losing weight is not as challenging as maintaining weight loss. But I am sure with the constant support I have received from so many of you, I will give it my all in keeping the weight off.

One reason I write this is because I have gotten several messages from others saying how my new lifestyle has caused them to get more fit. I can’t tell you what it means to be an inspiration to others. Given all of the perceived hate in the world, love is what rules. And I have felt the love from my dear friends and family, especially Jenna!

Thank you to everyone for your love and support. You all mean so much to me and I feel so proud that I have been able to inspire others to get out and enjoy the outdoors!","Update: I have now lost over 200 pounds, signed up for half marathon","Update: I have now lost over 200 pounds, signed up for half marathon Friends, I had a lot of feedback from my last post, so I wanted to give you an update.

In late September, I had lost 157 pounds in 12 months. Since then, I have lost an additional 45 pounds. At the time, I had just run my first (virtual) 10K race. I am now signed up for a half marathon for April. On Friday, I ran over 10 miles in 1 hour, 36 minutes.

[(UPDATED PHOTO)](https://ibb.co/42HdKWN)

I have found that it's harder to keep losing weight. Even as I step up the intensity and length of my workouts, I have found it a little more challenging (but not impossible). My body also looks fat. I have loose skin all over my body, which makes me still feel fat at times.

But guys, I have to tell you it's amazing to be down to 218. I still want to lose a little more, and think I still can.

I also want to say something about companies like Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Advocare and others. I am sure they truly believe in their product. I am sure they work for some people. But I believe they have given people the wrong idea about losing weight. There is a cost of entry to those programs (in some cases, a very expensive cost of entry). It gives so many people the idea that if you don't have the money, you can't diet... THIS IS SO WRONG!

Every bit of research out there shows eating a low-calorie, well-balanced diet coupled with regular exercise leads to weight loss. That isn't that hard. I really feel if you just watch what you eat (I have used an app, but pen and paper still works), and compared that to how many calories you burn a day, odds are, you'll become fit.

Anyway, thanks for everyone who supported me. Below, I have attached my post from late September:

# My weight loss journey 1 year later

June 2, 2019, I waddled my 420-pound body up Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls. My wife and I have taken an annual road trip for our anniversary every year since getting married in 2014. Our 2019 trip was special as it was the first time I had ever spent the night outside of the United States.

I had always been fairly athletic despite my size. I played basketball and tennis almost every day growing up. My diet, however, was horrific. I lived off Hot Pockets and ice cream. But exercising every day at least kept me from ballooning as a teenager.

Then adulthood came, and the perceived time I had for exercise was replaced with work and chores. Leisure no longer felt like a priority.

Walking never felt like a challenge, and the walk from our hotel to the falls wasn’t hateful as it was downhill. But returning from the falls, I was gassed. The simple act of walking had fatigued me to the point that I had to stop. I was shameful.

I had never really felt “unhealthy” until this point.

**Shamers be shaming**

August 3, 2019, was a gut-wrenching day for many of us in the US. That Saturday, I had just taken Jenna’s car to get an oil change. We found out her rear brake lights would not work, and it appeared there were electrical malfunctions. We were planning on replacing her car at the end of the year, so leaning of a potentially expensive electrical issue prompted us to decide on buying a new car.

When I came home, I heard that there was a massacre at the El Paso Walmart. I checked in with our Saturday person at work, and she was going to need some relief at some point (any one who has worked in breaking news understands how draining these massacres are).

After working an unexpected Saturday shift, I went to bed planning on teaching a few classes in the morning and then going to buy Jenna a new car. After briefly falling asleep, I received a text that another massacre happened, this time just 15 miles down the road in Dayton. Having graduated from Wright State and then working at the Dayton Daily News, I had many friends living in that immediate area. My thoughts turned to them as I now had to work another shift, this time in an area I knew quite well.

While reporting on the events taking place in Dayton, some of my tweets went viral. Immediately, some of the responses weren’t about the shooting, but about my weight. There is this huge tragedy happening in Dayton, and my weight was the issue for some on social media.

To be fair to other reporters, this was a new experience for me. For many of my (especially female) colleagues, the vitriol of fat-shamers can be far worse. I am not an on-camera journalist, but for those who are, the shaming can be downright vitriolic. But given the two tragedies going on, it was tough to process this hate I was receiving.

A few weeks later, I watched a segment on Bill Maher’s show about how there should be more fat-shaming in society. It had me thinking that all of those people tweeting at me during another tragic night in our country were the ones who were right, and who am I to judge them?

I decided to get a gym membership. But the very thing that was driving me to get in shape was what was scaring me off. If these fat-shamers are so spiteful online, how much shame will I face at a gym?

Last September, I went for a walk at VOA Park in Butler County, Ohio. The loop there is 1.5 miles. I felt so exhausted just going once around that loop.

I had enough.

I knew I wanted to get into shape.

For several weeks starting around late September 2019, weighing over 420 pounds, I started walking as fast and long as I could. The 1.5-mile walk quickly became 3-mile walks. While I wasn’t seeing results on the scale, I was feeling better mentally.

**Shamers replaced with cheerleaders**

After a few walks, I already ran into a few folks at VOA Park who saw how much of a sweat I was working up, and gave me so much encouragement to keep moving. I never expected to get thumbs up from people. You quickly realize that for every person out there shaming you, there are dozens ready to push you and help you.

As the weather turned colder, I finally worked up the courage to enter a gym. And it’s true about Planet Fitness… it truly is the “No Judgement Zone.”

I struggle with depression and anxiety and some past trauma.  Once I slipped up and began spiraling downward it didn't take long to completely revert to my former sedentary state.  And once that began happening it just made me feel worse and lead to gaining more.  I'm sure many if you know that cycle.

I'm not sure of my current weight but I'm afraid to get on the scale and find out.  I'm afraid I'll let the number I see discourage me.  Rationally I know I shouldn't, but I know myself.  So I think first I'd like to try to make some progress in bettering my lifestyle and getting back into better shape before I do that.  And I started that Sunday, 3 days ago.  I went for a mile run (aka slow jog) all 3 days, went on walks walks my 3yo daughter and played at the playground with her, today I roller skated a little bit.

In 2018 I busted my butt and reached a point when I was running 5k 3-4 days a week.  Reached the point when I could push myself to do 10k.  I was into roller derby for a short time.  I had never felt or looked better.  I want to feel that way again.  I want to feel proud of my run distances, of my ever improving 1 mile pace, I want to do a color run again and a zombie run for the first time (if these things even still exist in covid world).  I want to be a good role model for a daughter, be the mom she deserves, a better partner to my SO.  I want to feel good about myself again.  I haven't in quite some time.  I'm about about hit rock bottom if not already there.

If I had to guess I'm probably at least 180+ lbs now but I'm really not sure.  And I definitely lost a ton of muscle and replaced it with fat.  I hate it and I'm angry at myself.  So now I'm turning it around.  It's time to fight through the depression, anxiety, and apathy again.  And I guess that's why I'm here posting.  This community helped me get there in 2018.  I'm hoping coming back here and making this post will help keep me on track.

So, here I am.  Day 3 of getting my life back on track in a lot of aspects.  Regaining my health and confidence is an important first step.  I'm making efforts to eat better and more mindfully and I will exercise in some way ir another every day.  Someone come kick my ass if I don't, lol.

I’ve lost almost 45lbs over the last year going from a BMI of 36 to 29 and while I am proud of my progress and lifestyle changes I have been feeling low this week because even though I’m a whole small child of weight gone I. Am. Still. Fat. 

My ultimate goal weight is 180 and I am aiming to be 200 by my birthday (in June) and I do understand that slow and steady wins the race - but I just needed to rant about my frustrations with weight loss. I’m aiming to lose about 60-70lbs total (I am extremely tall and at my lowest weight of around 165 I looked too thin for my body so 170-180s is my ideal range) BUT ITS SO ANNOYING GETTING THERE.

I just wanted to rant - has anyone who has lost large amounts of weight felt this? Any tips or advice?

It’s still not easy for me, but it finally feels sustainable. I don’t do IF or Keto or Paleo. I just eat less than I burn. I’d been obese since my 20s and I kick myself for not starting sooner, but it really never is too late.

However, last year I sprained an ankle badly, and that coupled with the pandemic made me super sedentary for a few months. Since then I've have had constant problems and pain with both feet.

The sprain is now better, but both my feet are in pain all the time that I think must be from plantar fasciitis (which I've been diagnosed with before). It makes it very hard to do any meaningful exercise like running, and even makes normal walking painful. I've been doing exercises meant to help PF but so far they just feel worse.

For context, I'm 5'10 and c 300lbs, so I'm conscious it definitely puts strain on my joints. I've always been super active until I sprained my ankle though (running, hiking, weight lifting etc) and my inability to even walk without pain is really getting me down and making weight loss feel harder.

0,"Chips were my downfall. I was always overweight, but after highschool I moved out from my parents house with ZERO idea of what nutrition was, and into an extremely stressful period of my life. It was also across the street from a corner store. *the perfect storm.* 

On average, I'd go through a bag and a half of family-sized chips every day. On top of whatever terrible takeaway dinner I had, and starbucks in the morning. Looking back on it, that is far too much. Seeing people pull out a bag of chips, eat some, then put it into the pantry for LATER was always insane to me. I almost found it funny. Why would you only eat some if you could eat them all???

It quickly turned into a comfort. The crunchiness and familiar flavours calmed me down in the hectic life I had grown into. And I kept going on like that for a while.

A few years later, I'm almost 100lbs less and a whole new person, but still I have never sat down with a bag of chips without finishing it. Obviously it happens FAR less often. (Maybe every 2 months when I get suuuper lazy) Last night, I had some calories left over in my budget. My boyfriend popped open a bag of chips and I sat down beside him. I was nervous because I honestly don't trust myself around chips.

So I grabbed a bowl, grabbed my scale, and poured out 50 grams of chips. WAY more than I thought I would get, putting it in a bowl makes it look SO much bigger. And I found myself enjoying the chips more when I only had a few of them, vs when blindly shoving my hand in a bag.

I felt super accomplished. I FEEL super accomplished. I had my favourite snack and didn't go ""off track"" for the day, and it completely quenched my craving and I feel more confident around a food I usually overindulge in.

0,"**tl;dr** After realizing that I haven’t healed from YEARS of trauma and the death of a loved one, I am finally ready to give myself the unconditional love and support and friendship that I give to everyone else in my life. It’s very scary.

**I have thought about writing this-and consequently have put it off-over and over for months.**

I’m not sure why the idea of writing this all out has seemed so daunting, other than perhaps the most obvious answer, which is that it’s not an easy thing to do.

I want to write about my weight loss goals and the support I’m hoping to find in this community, because I think it could really change the way I view and engage with my ambitions and beliefs about weight loss/ myself. But it feels like I can’t do that without explaining how I got here.

This may be long winded, but I really hope some of you read this. And I’ll do my best to keep it to only the most necessary details.

I sat in the doctor’s office (where I’m guessing so many of our epiphanies occur) the other day and was going in to meet a psychiatrist. I hadn’t expected to get weighed. Weigh ins have long been a source of complete and utter terror/anxiety for me. I am 26 now, and I remember being in middle school and having public weigh in’s in PE (which definitely should not be allowed????) and being completely sick over the prospect of it. This is a deep rooted anxiety, which goes far beyond the number on the scale. But more on that later. For now, I’m sitting in the plastic chair of the psychiatrist’s waiting room, being told it’s time for my vitals to be taken. I understand why it was necessary, but it was a real moment of heartbreak for me. That is something that I have really become aware of in my life-how my complete awareness of my body (and the way it looks and moves and the space it takes up) makes even the most innocuous tasks very emotional for me. I don’t have a single moment free from that. I am constantly perceiving the world through a lens that is hyper focused on my weight and my body. It’s led to an agoraphobia and fear of places and people that totally contradicts my personality. I’m a super social person and I love being out in the world. But I don’t want to be seen. I want to hide. I am….I’m sad. I’m sad.

She tells me my weight. 250. 250!!!!! There’s freedom in typing that. No one in my life would believe that number. Though this is by far the highest weight I’ve ever been, a lifetime of masking and over-compensating for my body has forced me to figure out how to camoflauge very well. I’m guessing most people would think I was 180 or so. Now that I think back on being 180 and thinking THEN that I was out of control, it all just makes me feel a little deflated. I sat there, actually very numb, and thought-”It’s okay, because this isn’t even your body. That’s just a number. It doesn’t reflect who you are and where you’re going.” 

My protective mechanism is disassociation. I learned to do it when I was very young and living with a tragically and dangerously alcoholic parent. I was not abused, but I witnessed my mother attempting suicide, was forced to call 911 for her multiple times by the age of 9, had to learn to deal with her alcohol related seizures, grew up without the love of stable female figures in my early  life (I’m a woman, since I failed to mention that earlier), etc etc. I love to write and paly music and act, so I genuinely began crafting fantasies of my future where I would be safe and loved and paid attention to. I should mention here that I have an INCREDIBLE father who has done a remarkable job in raising me. But as a single parent, he worked a lot and I definitely felt unloved and abandoned until I was old enough to understand the sacrifices he made for me. (Late teens, early twenties is when our relationship fully became the solid best friendship it is now. He’s my rock, and he honestly is the reason I’ve gotten this far. Love him SO much.)

I always had a lot of friends and was genuinely very loved, so I don’t want to make it seem like I was physically alone. I think there was more a deep, deep, feeling of abandonment and unworthiness, having to take care of a parent that young. I couldn’t understand why my mom couldn’t get better for me. She was a great mom when she was sober, and she was full of love. But her own hurt and pain from her own life got in the way. She was the youngest of 6 kids, born to Hollywood director and actor parents, very beautiful and smart, and she was put into dangerous positions at way too young of an age in the 70’s and 80’s. super interesting, and I will post about it one day. But her mother, my grandma, was an alcoholic (though she’s 55 years sober now! Go Grandma Josephine!) and she was the victim of alot of misjustice. I am not blaming her. But there was so much pain for me from such an early age. She felt very guilty about it, and when she was with me, she’d shower me in gifts and yummy food. Things my dad wouldn’t give me. I still remember my first McDonald’s hamburger and my first Jack In the Box hamburger when I was in kindergarten. That created the blueprint for the emotional relationship with food I only JUST realized I have!!!

Anyway, fast forward through the early years. I became an adolescent with no mom and very little contact with her side of the family. My hips started to grow. My breasts started to grow. My dad did his best, but he was a punk rock guy with a 12 year old girl. He had NO idea how to tell me what was happening to my body. He bought me my first bra and first box of tampons and never made me feel embarrassed, but he also didn’t really know how to talk about it with me. (Once again, I totally understand. Lmao. Bless my dad. I still remember phone calls with him from the tampon aisle asking me if I wanted the “blue flavor or the green flavor” which was nervous dad for “regular or super.” He’s a precious man.)

I truly began to compartmentalize. I was happy, in general, and very bubbly and social-but all the while this deep, soul, wound felt as if it was growing and growing. I struggled with weight, but it hurts my heart to think of it, because I was perfect how I was. I was a kid. 

People have talked about my body since I can remember. I am black/french and Italian, which basically means Black and White, and from the time I was 5 years old, I was aware of how different I supposedly was. When I was 5, I remember playing house with two classmates in my kindergarten class, and there was a discussion of who was going to be mommy, daddy, and baby. It was myself, another little girl, and a boy named Matthew Fuller. I’ll never forget his name or his face. I and the other little girl both wanted to be “mommy” (EW at this gendered nuclear family bullshit, btw. It’s so gross to think back on how conditioned we are from a young age to place ourselves in these roles and be seen as a wife and mother. UGH...but I digress) but Matthew made the choice. He told me I was fat and my skin was too brown. LITERALLY. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID.

I was a baby...he was a baby! But I carried that with me through out my LIFE, man. I really did. And the microaggressions of being a mixed girl with a white mama and a black dad in the 90’s and 2000’s really played a role in how I saw myself. And by extension, how I treated myself.

By my teen years, I felt ugly and fat. I have had the same group of best friends since I was 11. I got SO lucky. They’re the best people on Earth. And they are BEAUTIFUL. I’m not just saying that. Like, my friends are incredibly beautiful. And I always felt like I was the funny one, or the smart one, or definitely the artistic one-but that seemed to pale in comparison to always being the one the cute boys wanted to talk to. And again, I want to stress-looking back, it hurts me how hard I’ve always been on myself. I was beautiful, too. I have always been smaller in terms of bone structure and height. At that time I was probably 5 feet tall or so. And I was around 150 pounds. I have an hourglass figure, so I carried the weight pretty well. But I also was comparing myself to my friends with completely different genetics, and I felt like I was hideous in comparison. It completely changed my life. I had panic attacks before things that were supposed to be fun, like parties and outings. When we were younger, my more neurotypical friends struggled to understand this, and thought it was dramatic of me to decide I literally could not go out if I couldn’t find something to wear. But again, I didn’t have the tools or comprehension to explain how much deeper it was than just not liking my outfit.

I was sexually assaulted at 16 by a close friend. The situation was awful and nobody really understood that rape could happen even if you were drinking and even if it was your friend. My experience was invalidated and ignored. It took a really long time to heal from that. Not sure if I have, to be honest.

Feeling unlovable, I then lost my virginity at 17 to my friend’s older brother who was much older and was super sketchy. I continued that pattern, of weaponizing my body to combat the voice inside of me telling me I wasn’t good enough.

The things that happened to me sexually as a result of that still really hurt me. I told no one.

I have dedicated my life to being the best friend and daughter I can possibly be to distract everyone from the fact that I am so afraid I will never find my person. I feel so much love for everyone that it feels like my heart is going to explode. But that is also my biggest weakness, because sometimes I feel so much it just hurts. It makes my eyes water writing that.

I’ve thought of killing myself constantly since I was like, 19. 

My dream was-and is still-to be a writer and entertainer. I want to be able to perform live without fear. I want to be able to act. And yet I feel like my weight is keeping me from my dreams.

I know that isn’t true. But the idea of failing to achieve my dreams is genuinely worse than death. And sometimes I think it would be easier not to exist. But I know how much it would hurt the people who love me and depend on me. So I never, ever will. I love life so much that it makes me want to die. Because I feel everything so deeply I sometimes can’t bear it.

My friend died in June almost 2 years ago. He was one of my best friends ever. I loved him deeply. I was always partially in love with him. I even thought one day, maybe, maybe MAYBE we might end up together. He felt like my soul mate sometimes. We met when we were 15 and he died at 24. He was super, super, wounded. In ways I didn’t even know the extent of. He OD’ed. He had just gotten out of rehab. I was supposed to take him to a meeting that day. Instead he died. I spoke to him the night before. I still can’t think about it. I cry, and I cry and I cry. I love you, J. I miss you.

I got a DUI. It was just a really dark time for me. I am SO FUCKING PROUD of coming out of that. My friend was dead and I found myself in the deepest well I’d ever been in. I think that trauma literally changed the chemistry of my brain. Nothing made sense anymore. Couldn’t focus. My eating went to hell. I mean….I feel like I lost those 2 years of my life. I don’t even remember them. I was in so much pain that I didn’t address.

Throughout those years, I abused my body, starved it, harmed it, you name it. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety as well as body dismorphia. I'm pretty sure I have a form of PTSD, but I've never been officially diagnosed.

Fast forward to now. I’m 26. I have done so much mental and emotional healing. All of the times I’d tried to lose weight in the past, it was about the physical. It was about a number on the scale. It was about the attention of men. It was about trivial things. Surface things. I never addressed the pain beneath. I never EVER gave myself grace or love or compassion, even though I am an incredibly loving and compassionate person.

It just kind of dawned on me the other day, even before the doctor’s visit, that I have begun to heal myself in a deep and personal way. I am unlearning my conditioned toxic beliefs each day. I truly love myself. I want a good life for myself. I know how capable and deserving I am. I have handled everything so far-and it can’t be for nothing. I am currently working on finishing an album and publishing my second zine of artwork and poetry. I look in the mirror and although I still feel triggered and sad-I know that isn’t the objective reality. I AM a beautiful person. And luckily, I’m actually very healthy. I just got a full panel of blood tests. I have no physical illnesses other than PCOS, which explains a lot of my weight gain and metabolism issues.  I'm on medication for that as well as mental health meds.

I am on medication for my depression and anxiety, which is giving me the motivation to actually get out of bed in the morning. I am LUCKY. I have a father who loves me. Friends who are an amazing support system. 

I have all of the tools to be successful. I saved up money, quit my job, and moved back home. I am safe here. I have the time and means to eat well and exercise. I am writing and working on my art. I am talking to my mom again, with my own boundaries set.

All that’s left is this. To care about myself enough to make my life better. To take control over my disordered eating. To be present and actively participate in my wonderful life.

I deserve it. We all fucking deserve that!!!!! So. I’m going to do it. It’s never felt like this before.

I guess, I’m just ready. I’m sure I left stuff out, but I’ve already written a fucking novel. I’m sorry about that. I needed to get that all out.

If you made it this far-you are amazing. Seriously. You had no reason to care, but the fact that you did makes me feel seen. Please, please, engage with me. Let me know if you have any thoughts, feelings, shared emotions, whatever! I truly look forward to the community I can build here, and hopefully it will help me with accountability and encouragement.

Lastly, I will show you my starting pictures. I plan to update later, so I really want to have the initial photos here to compare to eventually. There are also some areas I'm kind of fixated on that I hope I can gain a more objective perspective on. Yikes, this part is really scary. But I want to be transparent about this process.  I'm just gonna throw in some pictures I took right now....so excuse my crazy hair and blah blah blah.

I’m terrified! Wish me luck! My life awaits!

[SW: 250 H: 5""3](https://imgur.com/a/zp0WxMH)",This is the first day of my life...,"This is the first day of my life... **tl;dr** After realizing that I haven’t healed from YEARS of trauma and the death of a loved one, I am finally ready to give myself the unconditional love and support and friendship that I give to everyone else in my life. It’s very scary.

**I have thought about writing this-and consequently have put it off-over and over for months.**

I’m not sure why the idea of writing this all out has seemed so daunting, other than perhaps the most obvious answer, which is that it’s not an easy thing to do.

I want to write about my weight loss goals and the support I’m hoping to find in this community, because I think it could really change the way I view and engage with my ambitions and beliefs about weight loss/ myself. But it feels like I can’t do that without explaining how I got here.

This may be long winded, but I really hope some of you read this. And I’ll do my best to keep it to only the most necessary details.

I sat in the doctor’s office (where I’m guessing so many of our epiphanies occur) the other day and was going in to meet a psychiatrist. I hadn’t expected to get weighed. Weigh ins have long been a source of complete and utter terror/anxiety for me. I am 26 now, and I remember being in middle school and having public weigh in’s in PE (which definitely should not be allowed????) and being completely sick over the prospect of it. This is a deep rooted anxiety, which goes far beyond the number on the scale. But more on that later. For now, I’m sitting in the plastic chair of the psychiatrist’s waiting room, being told it’s time for my vitals to be taken. I understand why it was necessary, but it was a real moment of heartbreak for me. That is something that I have really become aware of in my life-how my complete awareness of my body (and the way it looks and moves and the space it takes up) makes even the most innocuous tasks very emotional for me. I don’t have a single moment free from that. I am constantly perceiving the world through a lens that is hyper focused on my weight and my body. It’s led to an agoraphobia and fear of places and people that totally contradicts my personality. I’m a super social person and I love being out in the world. But I don’t want to be seen. I want to hide. I am….I’m sad. I’m sad.

She tells me my weight. 250. 250!!!!! There’s freedom in typing that. No one in my life would believe that number. Though this is by far the highest weight I’ve ever been, a lifetime of masking and over-compensating for my body has forced me to figure out how to camoflauge very well. I’m guessing most people would think I was 180 or so. Now that I think back on being 180 and thinking THEN that I was out of control, it all just makes me feel a little deflated. I sat there, actually very numb, and thought-”It’s okay, because this isn’t even your body. That’s just a number. It doesn’t reflect who you are and where you’re going.” 

My protective mechanism is disassociation. I learned to do it when I was very young and living with a tragically and dangerously alcoholic parent. I was not abused, but I witnessed my mother attempting suicide, was forced to call 911 for her multiple times by the age of 9, had to learn to deal with her alcohol related seizures, grew up without the love of stable female figures in my early  life (I’m a woman, since I failed to mention that earlier), etc etc. I love to write and paly music and act, so I genuinely began crafting fantasies of my future where I would be safe and loved and paid attention to. I should mention here that I have an INCREDIBLE father who has done a remarkable job in raising me. But as a single parent, he worked a lot and I definitely felt unloved and abandoned until I was old enough to understand the sacrifices he made for me. (Late teens, early twenties is when our relationship fully became the solid best friendship it is now. He’s my rock, and he honestly is the reason I’ve gotten this far. Love him SO much.)

Since october I‘ve (F23) been losing weight and i did notice that 2 weeks before my period my weight would either stay stagnant or move just 200-300 grams up or down on the scale. When my Period starts I‘ll suddenly lose 1-1,5 kg. So I know it is normal but this has been going on for 3 weeks and now I do not know if I hit a plateau or if my body is just weird like that.

My family and I want to lose weight together and we started counting calories.
We currently use Lifesum, however it doesn't really fit our needs.
Now I'm looking for an alternative app and I hope you have some recommendations! :) 

I should be able to put in my own recipies and it would be useful if I can put in the amount of grams the meal has instead of the portions because we all eat a different amount. The way we have to do it now is very complicated and takes a lot of time to calculate. 

It would be perfect if I could be able to share the recipe, so that my family members can track the same one. Because right now one of us puts in the recipe and then we calculate the calories for each person and they can only put in the calories and don't have the nutrients. 

Thanks for your help! I appreciate every bit of advice! :)

Am I crazy or is my body reacting the complete opposite of expected? I was better off before I started working out!"

0,"TL;DR at the end

I, like many of you, struggled with weight issues nearly my entire life. When I was a kid, I was decently fit until around the 2nd grade, where I began to have some slight health issues. Due to my allergies, my doctor recommended to my parents steroids to help accelerate my growth in hopes to phase out my allergies. As a result, I gained a massive amount of weight (and height) extremely quickly. After that, I excepted myself as the ""fat guy,"" and it destroyed my self-image throughout public school and a good chunk of college. I consistent told myself ""I'm just not a skinny guy,"" ""there's nothing wrong with being fat,"" ""I love food to much,"" ""I could lose the weight if I wanted to, but I'm good where I'm at,""
etc.

Then 2019 comes around. I'm at my parents place over fall break, and I go and take a shower. I turned and caught myself in the mirror nude, my immediate gut reaction was one of disgust. You know when you don't intend to see yourself in the mirror, and you do, you have a moment when you don't subconsciously think you're looking at yourself? That happened. I was disgusted of myself. I hated myself. I weighed myself and was 249 pounds. I thought about all the things I've told myself, specifically the ""I could lose the weight if I wanted to"" thought. I wanted to prove that theory, do I have the ability to fix this? This marks the beginning of my weight loss journey.

There's been some ups and downs, but I'm currently 185 pounds and shooting for 175 (well more like 11% body fat). However, I still look at myself and see myself as a fatass. I don't know if I have body dismorphic disorder, but I definitely have symptoms of it.

However, as I'm getting ready to go to bed last night (I sleep shirtless so I'm shirtless in this moment), I caught myself in the mirror right above my dresser. My subconscious didn't realize I was looking at myself, and my gut reaction was one of envy. The lighting highlighted my arms and my stomach, where some slight abs are beginning to develop. It also highlighted my stretch marks on my side, my upper chest, and my profile frame. I viewed myself as sexy, and fucking lost it. I cried so fucking much. It took me like 15 minutes to stop. I'm so happy I've accomplished this, and I'm not even done. I'll never be done after an experience like that.

I want to thank everyone from all the health subreddits (CICO, fasting, 1200isplenty, loseit, progresspics) for a lot of my motivation. I literally have a Reddit account just to view these daily, and the stories a see and read are so damn motivational. I couldn't do it without y'all.

First, some stats: I'm F/5'8""/152 lbs.

My goal is to get down to about 140.

I just began training for my first half marathon, and I do strength training a few times a week, along with short daily yoga sessions. My job is fairly active, I work in a mechanics shop so I'm on my feet a good portion of the day. I'm wondering what you guys think my calories should be at? Right now i'm hovering around 1300 but my weight has been stable the past week ... I'm wondering if I should suck it up and go pretty low cal until I hit my goal which isn't SUPER far away.. or if I should just stay in a slight deficit. I'm really motivated right but don't want to wind up binging.

0,"Hi, this is my first post on r/loseit. I have been keeping up with posts here for some time and I noticed that many posts involve extreme weight loss journeys.

For me, I only moved from one healthy weight to another. However, the change was still quite drastic and this has been very stressful for me. 

Recently, I put on weight due to exam stress and hit a BMI of 22, which is still healthy, but considered not ideal in Asian society, especially where I live. 

Hence, to motivate myself to lose weight, I watched videos of morbidly obese people eating. At that time, I was really quite anxious about my body and didn't really think about the long term consequences. 

Watching obese people eat junk food triggered a strange gag reflex in me that caused me to quit snacking. Due to this shortfall, I run calorie deficits almost 5 days a week.

My weight has been plummeting (down 7kg/15pounds in 3 months). I am currently at a healthy weight (BMI 20), which I am quite happy with. Even though most Asian beauty standards expect me to be even more skinny (which would make me severely underweight), I do wish to stay healthy and stop losing weight. 

However, I can't stop my weight loss because I have become quite used to my calorie deficits. Also, I recently watched ""To The Bone"" on Netflix and now feeling skinny makes me unbearably stressed. 

Just today, I lay down on the floor to rest, which was quite comfortable when I had more fat on my body. Now, it hurts a bit because my pelvic bones stick out more. I immediately got reminded of eating disorders and this made me panic and worry about my body, even though I am still healthy. 

I really would like to stop worrying about my body and just live normally. There is just so much input from the media (since eating disorders and body-positivity are being more widely discussed now, which is a very good development. I have nothing against it)

0,"Ok so, I've been working out pretty consistently over the last 2.5 months.

I bought a treadmill in January to help me get myself in shape and to try to “tone up” before summer. I am hell bent to feel more confident in a swimsuit than I did LAST summer so I’m pretty motivated. 

I’m a 5’7” 36 yo female, 202 lbs, 40” hips, 38” waist. I wear a size 10/12 in jeans. 

Anyway, I’m running a 5k on the treadmill about 5 days a week now and also some light weight training to tone my arms up too. I drink a lot of water every day and a low calorie protein drink after I exercise in the mornings while I’m getting ready for work. I have been logging most of my meals on MyFitnessPal but I have a history of an eating disorder and meticulously tracking food can easily send me down the eating disorder rabbit hole, so I just try to track most of the time and I seem to carry a slight caloric deficit. All things considered, I should be losing weight. However, I haven’t gained or lost a single pound or inch. 

I have Hashimoto’s thyroid disease and PCOS that might account for difficulty losing weight but they’re both managed well right now so I can’t blame the lack of progress on those. Where am I going wrong? I’m seeing a lot of benefits in my cardiovascular fitness which continues to make exercise worthwhile but I just feel like I should be seeing SOMETHING even slightly noticeable somewhere on my body. My loved ones have given me honest feedback that they don’t see any change and that they see me every single day and that’s likely why. I saw a friend of mine after not seeing her in months and she said I looked the same. I know not to expect miracles but I do think after a couple of months that I should be able to see some minuscule indication of change. It really brings me down sometimes. I bought a Peloton to change things up a bit. It will be delivered in late April.

i've been overweight and dealing with weight loss my whole life. in 2018, i lost a lot of weight. at that point, it was the lowest weight i've ever been. i was getting compliments from everyone, which obviously made me really happy. despite this, i still hated myself. i hated the way i was shaped and the way i looked in general, and people around me still continued to body shame me.

fast forward to 2020 and i gained everything i lost. in fact, i gained 25kg. 

currently, i'm at the heaviest weight i've ever been and i'm miserable. i never stop thinking about food or my weight, it's exhausting. i'm tired of people not respecting me and treating me differently because of my weight. i hate that i'm ashamed to go outside and can't wear clothes that i like.

i've been overweight and dealing with weight loss my whole life. in 2018, i lost a lot of weight. at that point, it was the lowest weight i've ever been. i was getting compliments from everyone, which obviously made me really happy. despite this, i still hated myself. i hated the way i was shaped and the way i looked in general, and people around me still continued to body shame me.

fast forward to 2020 and i gained everything i lost. in fact, i gained 25kg. 

currently, i'm at the heaviest weight i've ever been and i'm miserable. i never stop thinking about food or my weight, it's exhausting. i'm tired of people not respecting me and treating me differently because of my weight. i hate that i'm ashamed to go outside and can't wear clothes that i like.

0,"hey, I was wondering if people could give me some tips and tricks on how to lose weight. I stepped on the scale today and i was quite shocked to see 95kg on the display (I'm only 1,75m!). Its one of my biggest things i dont like about myself and I'm done not being able to fit any pants or my old medium sized tshirts. its time for action.

To give you some context, I'm a 26 year old male that has zero to none physical exercise during a normal work week (i sit behind a computer all day for work, especially during these covid times) and I eat quite a lot of take-out food when hanging with friends.

I did some research and I've been 8-16 fasting for quite a while now and watching my calories intake as far as im able to, but this alone doesn't do much of course, so i wanna start running at least 3 times a week (maybe around 4km a run) but I'm a complete noob when it comes to losing weight or researching my food.

i feel kinda insecure about running during the day (and i also absolutely despise going to the gym, for the same reason i guess) so i used to run at night, but me and my family moved to a different city and due to Covid there's now curfew. I have a hard time starting again for I'm the kind of person that likes to run from his problems instead of fixing them. its one of my biggest flaws and im getting tired of myself.

Do any of you guys have tips on how to start losing weight? Are there any diets i could do or smart lifestyle choices i can make to make it a little easier? i know there's  no easy way to do this and losing weight simply requires hard work an discipline but i was still curious to see what other people would say. sorry for the long post, but i felt like giving some extra context.

What are some things I can do until I can run again? I have a bicycle and I am open to body weight training. I have thought about some sort of HITT routine but am completely unsure of where to start.

Hey All! Long post ahead. 

I am currently 180lbs (81.65 kg) and am 5’6” (167.6cm), 24F. My starting weight was 240lbs back in June 2017 (I gained the freshman 50 in college) and lost a total of 50lbs in 5 months starting off! I did this by increasing exercise, counting my calories and learning about nutrition. During 2018-2019 I ate mostly keto which I found did not work for me losing weight but instead I maintained.
Fast forward to 2020 I was pregnant and went back up to 230lbs. Since having my baby TWO months ago I have officially lost ALL of the baby weight AND an additional 10lbs!! 
I achieved this by: 
1. counting my calories (again lol)
2. Incorporating protein bars/shakes for my sweet tooth 
3. Aiming to workout for 1 hour a day (lifting or YouTube HIIT)

What I have learned thus far:
1. Focus on one day at a time, I DO NOT think about tomorrow’s workout until tomorrow
2. Get it done first and focus on excuses later (mind trick: there will be none because it’s already been done)
3. Find motivation when you feel all hope is lost, because that time WILL come and you HAVE to be prepared for it

This journey has been LITERALLY filled with ups and downs especially with a new addition to my family but that’s apart of life. This community has been a GAME CHANGER for my motivation!!

I'm posting on here because I'm incredibly frustrated and don't want to stray away from my goals. I have lost 60 pounds since November through a pretty intense calorie deficit and becoming more active. My SW was 292 pounds and I'm down to 233 today. I'm a researcher and naturally very drawn to data and trends. I have been tracking my weight loss to make sure it's healthy and sustainable and also to make sure that what I'm doing is working. I watch my calorie intake and sodium intake because I know that seeing varying numbers frustrates me. 

12 days ago I tested positive for COVID-19. I isolated in a hotel for 10 days through a program NYC has and was unable to leave the room, and had 3 meals a day provided to me. I ended up getting to my lowest weight during this stay, 231.6 pounds. I had a cheat meal the day before I left isolation, then got back to my apartment and immediately restarted my morning walks and cooking healthy meals. I noticed that the day after my cheat meal, I gained weight (which was expected.) The day after that, my weight went up again, even though I was chugging water and watching my sodium and calories. The next day my weight dropped a bit, and today, my weight again went up despite watching my calories and sodium. 

I've been told that a possible reason this is happening is because I'm gaining back muscle mass after being bed ridden for 10 days, and also that weight fluctuations of 1-2 pounds are normal. Is that true? I know this may sound irrational to be thinking about so intensely, but I rely on trends and numbers to show me that what I'm doing is working.

I’ve been losing weight since March of last year. Quarantine started my weight loss journey and really allowed me the time to think about healthy habits, what I wanted my future to look like, how I wanted to improve my Heath, etc. 

But what no one told me about weight lost is that after you lose the weight, you still think you’re fat. Someone has to feel this way too. Everyone has told me how different I look, I see old photos and am literally shocked, and even my sister(if you have a sister you understand) told me I looked good. Yet I still find myself wearing XL sweaters, I avoid walking in narrow places because I think I won’t fit, several of my friends have mentioned how I talk about myself as if I still think I’m 224 pounds. College boys talk to me now, THEY FLIRT WITH ME. I HAVE BEEN ASKED ON DATES. Not that I need their validation, but I’m flabbergasted college boys find me attractive now. Also kind of sad because like it took losing weight for people to notice how awesome I am. 
It’s also weird because I’m not at my goal weight. I’m not considered healthy yet. Yes, I feel great and am content with how I look, but I’m still overweight. 

I am aware I’ve lost weight. I know that I look better now.

I am 26f I stand at 164cm tall (5ft4in)
Current weight: 123kg (272lbs)
Goal weight: 55 (121lbs)
Weight to lose: 68 (150lbs)

I am currently considered morbidly obese. 

TL:DR it's my fault I got this big. 

I bit of backstory. I grew up in a family where none of the women were happy with their bodies, everyone was either on a diet or starting a diet and talked constantly about losing weight whilst most of them were overweight if not obese themselves.. so I already started to have body image issues from a young age. 

Due to that I developed disordered eating and then later in life to cope with my abusive upbringing I developed an eating disorders at 14. I have been overweight since I was 12 and obese from 17. I can't remember a time I was a healthy weight.

But I have also always talked about losing weight, even before I was 14 but I have always kept putting weight on. It doesn't help that I quit smoking 3 years ago so I out in weight then. 

The problem with my weight though, is that my pride and ego refuses to accept that it is in anyway my fault. I have gone from doctor to doctor to have every test possible to make sure I am not unwell and that's why I am getting bigger, and when I get told I am perfectly healthy I just get angry. Or blaming medication for my weight gain when it's really only been when I am on anti depressents that my weight has been stable. 

And with all that, I am the heaviest I have ever been. Over the last year I have received help (health, trauma etc) where necessary and feel much better about the prospects of losing weight. 

But for some reason I was getting bigger, well it must be something else making me fat...WRONG!

My bank account is currently over drawn, I borrowed money off a friend to make it to pay day, I used vouchers to buy groceries.. but where did all my money go. Well? Takeaway. 

I have an addiction to takeaway, I mean how else do you keep putting on weight when all people see is you eating healthy home cooked meals, even though I am to ashamed to admit I buy takeaway every other day. I recognised these addict behaviours this week, they remind me of what I was like when I used to smoke. 
And my pride and ego took a hit as I was forced to accept my addiction and the role I have played in my own weight gain, I could no longer lie to myself, it was set in stone. 

But I feel encouraged, no more lying to myself. No more playing the victim. I am obese from my own doing, and I'll become healthy by my own doing. 

I think I now can tackle this weigh loss journey. I have some fears and hesitation (but that's for another post), but with the right support network. I'll get through this.

cw: mentions of weight, dieting, and eating disorders

TLDR; I want to eat better and lose weight, but my girlfriend is recovering from anorexia and we eat most of our meals together. I’m scared that my diet change will affect the way she eats and cause a relapse.


I’m (20F) currently dating my wonderful girlfriend (21F), and we’ve been together for almost a year. Having been together all throughout various lockdowns, she’s been an amazing support and we’ve grown very close very quickly. One thing we have bonded over is our shared experience of dealing with EDs (anorexia mostly) in our teenage years and ongoing. I was very ill around the ages of 15/16, but have been in recovery since about 17. As of now, I consider myself to be doing really well in my recovery; I’m no longer punishing myself for eating or obsessing over calories etc, I feel like I’m back on track. My girlfriend hasn’t been so lucky; her ED took hold in her later teen years and she has only started recovering since a little before we met. In the last year she has made incredible strides and I am so proud, the difference is incredible and she looks healthy and happy.
However, over lockdown, I’ve put on a bit of weight (as I’m sure many of us have). I’m not punishing myself for it - it’s natural and understandable to gain weight when you’re in a global crisis - but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m quite unhappy. My body has been many shapes and sizes over my life, and in its current state I don’t feel as good or healthy, and I want to get back to a place where I’m happy, which involves losing a bit of weight from eating better.

Now here’s my conundrum: my girlfriend is not as far in her recovery journey as I am. I feel very capable of improving my diet in healthy and sustainable ways without triggering a relapse; however, my girlfriend is not quite there yet. I’m terrified that if I mention my want to get fitter she will follow along with it for the wrong reasons.
We eat almost every meal together, and split our time between my house and hers. When we’re together, we eat great food (she’s a fantastic chef) but it’s not exactly the healthiest meals and that’s contributed a lot to my weight gain. 
I’m not quite sure how to handle this; I don’t want to eat completely separately from her and make her feel like she’s eating the ‘wrong’ thing, but I don’t want to force her to cook healthier meals when she is still pretty underweight and doing really well eating how we are currently.
She also has a habit of adjusting her eating schedule to mine, eg, she won’t eat unless I’m eating, she’ll change her portions to match mine, etc. For these reasons I’m really scared she will match what I’m doing and relapse hard.
Sorry this is so long. Any advice!? I’m really determined to get back to a physical fitness I’m happy with but I’m terrified of risking my girlfriend’s health and happiness.",Losing weight with an ED recovering partner,"Losing weight with an ED recovering partner

I suspect some kind of depression, but I'm not sure, so here I am asking, do any of you know this situation?

Besides that, I'm a 24 male, 1,83cm (6'0""), and I just lost 10kg (22lbs) in a month, which makes me very happy.

I'm just a little worried about my calories in. This week, my calories in were very low (around 300 to 500) and I didnt feel the need to add more, this is why it startled me. Writing that it feels like I'm bragging but I'm really not, thing is, I could probably continue with such low calories in, but since I'm working out in the same time that I'm losing weight, it becomes quite annoying, not to mention dangerous.

0,"I was reading through this Reddit and saw all the support and motivation everyone here gives to one another. It made me realise that one of my friends actually really sucks now that i’ve lost weight. I went from being 165 lbs (75kg) to 110 lbs (50kg) at 5’3 (160cm).

It was clear to me that I always was considered the fat, less attractive friend compared to her, but now that i’ve lost the weight and get more attention, i realise how one of my friends still tries to manipulate me into thinking that it is a privilege that i get to hang out with an ‘attractive’ person like her.

When i’m talking to somebody, she’ll come around and mention how I used to be overweight and still eat like a pig, but she’s covering it as a joke or ‘compliment’. She really used me as the shy and (in her terms) ugly friend to make herself seem better and now that i’m less shy and more confident, she can’t use me anymore for that purpose. 

You guys made me realise that i deserve better than those comments and those people. I hope that, if somebody reads this, you realise that you never ever have to accept this kind of behaviour, regardless where you are in your journey. You are beautiful and deserve happiness; never be dependent on someone that makes you feel shit to uplift themselves.

Some background: I started CICO and consciously trying to lose weight in a healthy way in late 2017. I achieved my goal weight in the winter of 2018/2019 after a bought of mononucleosis ""helped"" me drop the last 6 or so kilos I was trying to lose, but lost the first 25kg exclusively through CICO.

Over the last 8 or so months, though, I've gained back around 10kg.

Then for dinner usually something from burger king or mcdonalds if we got ihop food. Then monday I eat pizza left overs for dinner and for lunch another mcdonalds burger, since I usually get the double burger combo but save the extra burger for the next day. I also get fries for both lunch and dinner every sunday. I also don't drink normal soda but medium diet soda instead and only on sunday, 2 if I got mcdonalds for lunch.

0,"So I have been on quite a journey and found that diet change instead of exercise was the key to my weight loss. I lost 32kg and felt amazing.. it put me from XXL to M/L size clothes and lowered my BMI from morbidly obese to overweight. 
Lockdown was not a major hindrance and although weight loss stalled as my lunch walks stopped and I snacked more, I didn’t gain weight despite the extra stress etc.

However the past 3 months I have been working overseas, on a short term contract, and was stuck in isolation for several weeks at a time. During this period, they provided food at very prescribed times. I have found that this makes me eat more food than when not pressed, as a way of preventing hunger pangs between these times. I am angry at myself as I know I can intermittently fast for several meals at a time so why does this bother me so much! 

Now that work has finally ended and I go home shortly , I’ve taken stock, and fear I am as much as 8lb more than when I arrived in December. So I now face a challenge of restarting weight loss rather than weight maintenance when I get home.

I started C25K - I've always been a runner but at that weight I had to reboot - and Re-downloaded Myfitnesspal.

And I haven't looked back! The weight fell off in the first weeks and I felt great, then the losses started to slow down. In the past, this is where I've given up because it hasn't felt as rewarding, but this time I pushed through.

I had a blip in December because I caught covid so couldn't run plus all the Christmas food but again I managed to push through in spite of gaining, which I haven't managed to do in the past.

And so today, as I edited my user flair, I realised I'd lost 74lbs (256lbs) with another 74lbs to go to my target of 182lbs. Which also made me realise that if I've done it once I can do it again.

I was also scared to go because I didn’t know what I was doing and had all of the nerves of “what will people think when they see me trying to figure out what a machine does??” (Yeah I know, nobody cares) 

Today I went by myself!! And I felt confident all through it and even hit a leg press PR and was able to push myself to keep going even after I didn’t want to. My weight loss journey is slow but it’s cool to see these type of achievements culminate :)"
0,"This might not be the right place. for this but it’s been on my mind snd idk where else to post this...

My (23F) staring weight was 270 at 5’10. 

I didn’t hate how i looked at my starting weight and have always been confident in my body and was able to feel good even at my largest. I’m losing weight because i want to be healthy and i want to avoid the afflictions of some of my family members...

Ive lost a total of approx 35lbs in 6 months (including regaining about 10 during the holidays) and people will not stop commenting on my body. 

I dont see too many people because of covid but I recently went to my partners parents house after they’ve been fully vaccinated and his mom kept talking about how much better i looked and how I should’ve done it sooner and she can’t wait to see me once i’ve lost all the weight, etc. She would also use me as an example that my partner also needed to lose weight and basically called him ugly and said he could look so much better if he lost weight “since I was able to do it. “

I’m conflicted because i am proud of the work i’ve put in but they way they describe it just makes me so sad. I wasn’t ugly before and i don’t really look “better” i just look a bit different. The way they’re congratulating my weight loss and making fun of my partner for not losing weight makes me feel like they saw me as a less than human person before i started losing weight.  

I always knew i was treated different/worse for being fat but I guess it’s kinda jarring to see people be so open about it. 

I knew with losing weight that people would notice and probably comment but this just makes me feel sad and gross and i really really hope that comments like this aren’t the norm when you lose weight.",Comments about my weight loss are making me incredibly uncomfortable,"Comments about my weight loss are making me incredibly uncomfortable This might not be the right place. for this but it’s been on my mind snd idk where else to post this...

0,"I feel as though every time I begin losing weight, I think about dieting to the point of obsession almost. I'm not undereating, but I just can't stop thinking about what kind of food to cook/eat, watching ""what I eat in a day"" videos, etc. I'm not even hungry while I do this, it's almost like a stress/anxiety response. I wish I could just eat the food I eat without having to think so much as well. 

It's not hard sticking to the calorie deficit necessarily, it's just the mental effort of thinking about it all the time that makes it exhausting. When I'm not in a deficit I'm able to eat intuitively without gaining weight, I haven't binged in years, and I try not to restrict too low, I just wish I could turn off my brain.

Since I've only been actively losing for about a month, I am wondering if anyone has advice about going from the ""this is new and requires effort"" mentality to ""this is just my life now""",Losing weight without obsessing about it?,"Losing weight without obsessing about it?

0,"It looks like I've finally gotten out of the obesity zone. I plan on weighing myself on Thursday. 

My belly looks so much smaller, it kinda feels like I've lost a part of myself lol. Hopefully I can knock off the next 50lbs without much issue.  I just landed a new job and I'm praying that my new work schedule doesn't interfere with my current gym routine. 

I recently found a video of myself from last May, a month before the gyms opened back up, I was happy to see how much I've changed and persisted through out 2020. I was cool with my hair and beard looking crazy back then, but now I put more thought into my appearance. 

My former self in the video feels foreign to me now. It's wild to see how much compassion and love I lacked for myself.",Feeling good,"Feeling good It looks like I've finally gotten out of the obesity zone. I plan on weighing myself on Thursday.

0,"Currently trying to lose weight. Not sure of an exact goal, but definitely trying to drop as much weight as possible before October 1st.

Anyways, found a exercise routine I'm happy with,  I just can't stop eating garbage. I eat when I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm stressed, when I'm bored. I just feel the need to snack or eat almost every 3hrs it feels like. I usually feel shitty after doing do as well. I know that with exercise you increase metabolic rate and may feel hungrier than usual, but this has been occurring even before weight loss. Could this be some sort of compulsive eating disorder? 

I've made the effort to replace the cookie and ice cream snacks with fruit and trail mix, but that's still a ton of sugar in fruit and the calories in trail mix add up quick. I try eating ice sometimes to get that ""snacking feeling"", but that's bad for your teeth.

0,"Im 24 and I stand tall at 6' 6"" I've been eating a little too much recently. I told myself that it's okay I'm big I require a lot more food but today I learned I'm bordering 300lbs. My family has issue's with weight loss and overeating so I want to get control of this before it's too late.

I have been walking and my job is super active for roughly 9 hours a day (and once the weather warms up I'll go jogging) so exercise isn't too much of a problem. 

The issue is dieting, I was told that keto works and then a week later was told that keto is fake. Same with Vegan, Meateater, and Atkins. I'm just receiving so many mixed messages on what I should eat. If anyone has a direction or maybe even some definite NOs, any help would be appreciated. I'm also allergic to eggs.",I need some direction,"I need some direction Im 24 and I stand tall at 6' 6"" I've been eating a little too much recently.
