,loseit,"This past year I went from an ""obese"" BMI (which I'm pretty sure I didn't look, I carried those pounds like a champ)  to a ""normal"" weight. Face gains can be seen [here!](https://imgur.com/a/1UgSqTb) For reference, I'm 5'4.

I've always been an active person. I was a competitive dancer from ages 5 to 14, and a three-sport athlete as a teenager. I had always been *tiny*, until puberty hit. At that time my metabolism slowed, my chest grew exponentially (32HH UK sizing at its largest), and I hated how I looked. I developed an eating disorder and fought my curvy adult body type until I was in college. I got therapy, started to heal my relationship with food, and my weight steadily went up and up and up. I continued to exercise; hiking, weight lifting, skiing. I was diagnosed with some chronic health problems around that time, including a vein disease, multiple-strain chronic lyme's disease, and chronic pain due to my chest size. I stopped exercising for the most part, because it *hurt*. 

By the time I met my now wife, and finished college, I knew I needed to make changes. I just felt really unhealthy. Obviously, the change I made was to enroll in doctoral-level graduate school! My stress went through the roof, and I also developed hypertension! Second-year of my grad program, I decided to try and get my health and stress under control. My career involves helping others be mentally healthy, and I wasn't healthy myself. So I got surgery to correct my vein disease. I did physical therapy for my chronic pain, and a few months later, I had an insurance-covered breast reduction surgery. Being able to stand on my feet without pain, and with my back pain greatly reduced, I was able to start exercising again.

Then COVID! I gained a good 15 pounds from drinking excess alcohol and eating excess junk food due to boredom and being stuck inside.  I hit my peak of 175, and I knew a ""lifestyle change"" was in order. I was worried about CICO due to my history of eating disorders, and initially had my wife plan my meals for me and count for me. Eventually, I was able to take over control and eat more intuitively, as I had a good understanding of what my portions should be. I'd estimate for Sept 2020 - March 2021 I ate within the range of 1200-1600 calories a day. I also stationary bike most mornings, walk a mile or two every day and hike most weekends. I eat what I want, just small portions and in a mindful way. 

I haven't felt this good ever. The last time I was this thin I was in high school, and actively purging. Now I am thin and strong because I have taken care of myself. I am really proud and sad I can't really share this with most people in my life. My wife is proud of me, as is my mother. My clients haven't noticed, and neither have my friends? Unless it's just hard to tell over Zoom or they don't feel comfortable telling me. It's an odd thing to celebrate.

,loseit,"**a little back story:**

i want to preface this by saying that i spent ten years subscribing to fat acceptance logic, ultimately believing calorie-counting etc. was incongruous with my feminist politics. i still believe fatphobia is a thing; i grew up in a family that was pretty fatphobic, and my parents were consistently derogatory about my aunt's weight. she was morbidly obese and died of bowel cancer in her early 60s. her death was clearly related to her weight but at the time i was just sad that my dad couldn't even have a funeral for her without commenting on her size in pictures. so i know the reasons why fat acceptance logic gets lodged in your brain - it's angering that fat folks are dehumanised to the extent they are, and yes 100% i think that it's wrapped up in misogyny. 

anyway, i was a tall and slender child but also gender-nonconforming from a young age. idk if i would consider myself trans now but i was always non-binary as hell as a kid. puberty and adolescence was extremely traumatic as a queer in a rural village with a lot of homophobia and transphobia at school. so i was body conscious as fuck and desperate to fit in, but always remember riding the wave of my slimness and tallness to insulate me from the additional shame of having excess fat. then i discovered alcohol in my early teens and drank consistently to deal with my sadness, for a very long time. at university this habit really took flight, and wasn't helped by the fact that from my late teens throughout my 20s, i was a touring musician. i was in bars and venues almost every weekend, and often for stretches of a few weeks at a time. my eating and drinking habits went out the window, particularly because payments for gigs for many years incorporated drinks riders and buy-outs. i got used to the idea that i was just going to be 'hench' or a 'big, strong person', which also fitted with my identity as a relatively masculine-of-centre woman who is also a guitarist. 

i discovered exercise properly at about 27, when i decided to try and learn how to jog for my mental health. i loved it but felt like i could never advance properly because i was always recovering from drinking or eating too much. i was vegetarian from age 20 to 29 so was also riding the wave of not eating meat, in terms of my weight remaining relatively stable, despite being above healthy BMI. then i met my partner, a food-loving canadian who is just over 4 years younger than me. she introduced me to the world of north american meat: chicken wings, ribs... we enjoyed ourselves so much as we were getting to know each other but good god: because i hadn't eaten meat really as an adult, i was on meat holiday in a big way. i really went to town, and the whole time i was reading more and more fat acceptance stuff, learning from fat activists in my music scene and community, and touring more than i ever had in my life. i could sense myself expanding but was becoming gradually more alienated from my own body. at the same time, i was deepening my relationship to running, and even did a half marathon. so i was like: yeah, big people can be athletic! and eat whatever they want! woo! 

NOT woo. so from 28 to 31, i was doing a phd. the last year, in particular, involved pretty much sitting all day long. my eating habits and alcohol consumption were also beginning to make exercise less appealing and less possible; i would go for runs and have to break every 10 minutes. alcohol was having a cumulative effect on my mental health: i would have terrible insomnia, i couldn't regulate my temperature, i was consumed with negative thoughts about myself, i had eroding trust in other people and was convinced this was just what life became when you lived in a capitalist hellscape. obviously i figured the best way to deal with these emotions and mental illness was just to....keep drinking whisky and eating M&amp;Ms. and this is the kind of shit i was consuming on instagram too: that i should just listen to my intuition and eat whatever i want because that is self-care.

so anyway, the pandemic comes along and me and my partner - who had become my wife by this point - go HAM with the ham, effectively. we literally spent two months playing breath of the wild, getting shitfaced and ordering mcdonalds. it was, tbh, really fun. but my head and my body were suffering. and i was starting to seriously dislike the way that i looked. thing is, this wasn't a new thing: from childhood i had felt disparaging about my body for obvious reasons, and didn't look in the mirror, for example, for years. when i did look in the mirror it was just for confirmation that i still sucked. but photos of me at gigs from before covid were unavoidable and i was progressively shocked at how overweight i looked. still, these thoughts and feelings came attached to inside voices shaming and policing me for critiquing my own body, as if i was being a terrible feminist and terrible ally to my fat friends. so i just buried it and continued on my merry, buttery way. 

in september i got my first full-time academic job and something in me just totally flipped. i realised i literally couldn't continue drinking in the way that i had been if i wanted to do well as a lecturer. my wife and i were going through an eviction by an evil homophobic landlord that lived in the house above us and the stress of that was also pushing us more and more to shit food and the bottle. i realised i wanted more mental and physical resilience and to live my best life, if only to stick it to people like her. so i bought a scale for the first time in my life. i had not had a scale for my entire 20s, believing them to be oppressive to women and part of the auditing, measuring culture that contributes to stress and feelings of inadequacy. 

anyway, i got this scale and i stood on it and sure as day, i was 234 lbs. in my wildest imaginings of where my weight had gotten to, this was a distant number. i immediately took to the NHS BMI calculator and there it was: BMI of 32.7 (i'm a tall human), you're obese baby. for the first couple of days i was in denial - i googled things like 'i don't look obese but BMI says i'm obese'. in my head, obese people looked like my aunt or lizzo. at the same time, i was also still struggling against the fat acceptance narratives in my head: i'm obese, isn't this something i should celebrate or something? literally it makes no sense to me now but that is something i genuinely thought. i'm not exaggerating. so after a couple of days of denial, peppered with anger and dispair, i was just like: yeah i'm gonna have to fix this. i figured out that i needed to lose 56 pounds to get to a 'healthy' BMI. when i told my wife this was the amount of weight i had to lose she was like shiiiiiiit. but she never doubted me. so here is how i did it: 

**how i lost 56 lbs in 5 months:**

Step One: 

i quit alcohol. forever. i stopped drinking on september 13, and my wife did too. i don't say this like it's easy for people, but it's hands-down the most important and best thing i've ever done for myself. i'm not gonna go on about the joys of being tee-total in this post (it belongs to another post probably) but there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that cutting out alcohol was one of the key reasons i was able to lose the weight i did. i also feel literally incomparably happier than i ever have in my adult life.  i still smoke weed - couple of tokes a night - so i don't consider myself sober, but alcohol poisoned my belief in myself and my body and i knew if i wanted to take my health seriously it needed to go. 

Step Two: 

i quit animal products, as did my wife. a week after i quit drinking, i decided to go vegan. at first i was still eating honey but that's gone now too. again, hate to be evangelical about this, but it made my body feel healthier than it ever has in my adult life. coupled with zero-alcohol, i started having the energy of like, my 9-year-old self. my skin youthened by about 5 years. seriously, my wife and i were like WE HAVE BENJAMIN BUTTONED OURSELVES WHAT IS HAPPENING. In the first two months of no booze and being vegan, weight melted off me. From 5 October to 29 November, I lost 19 pounds. i was exercising too, but not like crazy. nothing more intense than what i had been doing before, which was running about 3 times a week. 

Step Three: 

i started actually drinking water. didn't do that before, quite literally couldn't understand the point (so alienated from my body and its needs). anyway, i started drinking at least two litres a day and it seemed to help everything on its way. also, my pee smelled better. win! 

Step Four: 

i unplugged from the internet. i deleted facebook and eventually instagram. this was an important part of my weight loss journey because i hadn't realised how susceptible i was to group think, and how disciplining social media was about what constitutes a morally good life or decision. unplugging from social media feeds allowed me to start thinking for myself, and spending more time in nature. that said, i compensated for my lack of feeds by getting heavily into youtube. obese to beast (john glaude) \*really\* helped me. i got super into his videos and started to understand that, actually, as an anti-capitalist, i was doing worse for the world by supporting the overproduction of food - and the nutritional crisis of obesity that unfolds from it - than by self-flagellating for wanting a smaller body. 

Step Five: 

after the initial weight came off, i had to develop a more serious strategy. first thing i did was actually log my calories. i used my fitness pal for this and it worked well, although i never weighed my food. so a lot of it was eyeballing/guess-work. i got round this by slightly overestimating amounts so that i could insulate myself from disappointment! anyway, without my fitness pal i would never have worked out that actually olive oil isn't inherently good for you. prior to this i would happily use a cup of oil in a salad dressing. so i started switching things out and becoming a bit more inventive: i would use vinegar bases for dressings, and use tahini to thicken it up instead. 

Step Six: 

i started doing body-weight training instead of running. this was partly because i ran too much one week and gave myself a hip flexor injury. so instead, i started doing HIITs and lots of planks, bridges and the like in the park in the morning. this made my body feel strong and i think sped up my metabolism. eventually, i mixed bodyweight training and running during the week.

Step Seven: 

i committed to a daily morning practice of food, movement and meditation. without alcohol I was able to go to sleep more easily and wake up more easily. as a result, I was able to gradually get to morning wake-ups at 6am (i had NEVER been a morning person because of alcohol and anxiety but had always dreamt of being one). i have eaten the same breakfast every morning for five months: oatmeal with agave and either half an apple or blueberries. in some ways i credit oatmeal for being my gateway drug to a healthy life. oatmeal powers me up and 45 minutes after eating it, i started going out and exercising, followed by a few minutes of meditation. this routine allowed me to start my day intentionally and with kind words to myself. 

Step Eight: 

i ate a cheat meal at least once a week. often this was a proper cheat meal, e.g. vegan fried chicken burger, giant cookie, fries, soda. i continue to do this every friday and the only thing that's changed is that, as my body gets healthier, i actually have much less desire to eat oily food. still, for me it's been important to have an evening of semi-indulgence. 

Step Nine: 

i stopped eating virtually any processed food and snacks, especially any with added sugar. i thought this would be harder than it was, but i managed it through swapping things out. i ate corn cakes and kallo spinach pesto cakes with vegan pate; i ate a lot of fruit and seeds; i would have like, only one biscuit rather than 25. 

Step Ten: 

i ate loads of fibre. this is easy to do when you're plant-based, but i also went for way more fibrous carbs. i starting making brown rice, sweet potato or quinoa my carb base, and eating it with loads of tempeh or tofu, tahini-based sauces and dressings, lots of green veggies like broccoli and spinach. tbh this is the food i love anyway, so i always felt satiated and satisfied. this diet hugely helped me exercise - i would never feel sleepy after meals (had just thought this was what happened to everyone after eating), and instead would feel energised. almost like... food can be fuel? 

Step Eleven: 

i incorporated movement into my work day. this one was hard because my job is frigging nuts right now, with teaching loads effectively doubled, if not tripled, by online delivery. i got a fitness watch which told me to stand up every hour and showed me how sedentary i was. again, hadn't realised this - really thought that running 3 times a week would somehow compensate for me sitting or lying down 90% of the time. so i started with the standing and then i did some walking at lunchtime, only a few minutes or so. i found this to be pretty boring so i got a LONGBOARD. this was a cheap board i found on ebay. i hate competitive sports and live on Plague Island so doing something solo that wasn't HIIT training or running sounded perfect. i started learning how to longboard in early February and now do that at lunchtime, when i can. i listen to miley cyrus and skate around the park feeling like the coolest 32-year-old in the world. 

Step Twelve: 

by the end of february i had started to plateau. initially this freaked me out but then i went back to treating myself like an interesting science experiment. so i dealt with plateaus through a combination of a) increasing my cardio - in particular, running and jumping more, hip-willing; and b) cutting back on oil. i had started to eat stuff like coconut oil, avocado oil, rapeseed oil - all of which are in vegan foods like pip &amp; nut almond butter, vegan mayo and store-bought hummus. by cutting back - not necessarily eliminating entirely - and doing a bit more cardio, i was able to continue to lose weight. often this was no more than a pound a week but a pound's a pound bitch! 

Step Thirteen: 

i treated weight loss like a degree. i got curious, fascinated, data-driven; i became a scholar of my own adiposity. i made charts that eventually became a spreadsheet, tracking my loss alongside my exercise habits of the month. i mapped out my menstrual cycle and read my weight loss alongside this information (i kept retaining or putting on weight during my period which initially stumped me until i remembered that obviously bodies change then they're menstruating). i consumed HUNDREDS of youtube videos about weight loss; i also listened to podcasts from the other side of the fence, i.e. intuitive eating, health at every size, fat acceptance. i came to the conclusion that the western world - nay the world in its entirety - is in some kind of nihilistic denial that will end in an apocalyptic mukbang while pharmaceutical, food-industry, and petrochemical companies fill their pockets. i also came to the conclusion that yes, obviously the people who are pumped full of the excess sugars and fats attendant upon the over-production of food are often the poorest. i also came to the conclusion that celebrating this is FUCKED UP, and that we should all be very, very angry about it. 

Step Fourteen: 

i talked about weight loss with the people that i know care about me, i.e. my mum, dad, sister, wife, and 1-2 friends. i shared what i was trying to do and how i felt about it. this was totally out of character for me as i had been so against intentional weight loss for so long. i embraced the delicious slice of humble pie and 'i was wrong in the past' accountability that this offered me, while offering a new path to deepening my relationships with those close to me, through the vulnerability of being open about body struggles. 

&amp;#x200B;

anyway i think that's everything. the main things, at least. still hoping to cut down by another 5-10 pounds so i have more wiggle room for my weekend indulgences but other than that, yeah keep going! you'll get there, bit by bit. and as miley sings: 

'Ain't about how fast I get there  
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side  
It's the climb' 

IT'S THE CLIMB EVERYBODY!",t2_264kfb3z,False,,1,False,obese to healthy BMI in 5 months: here is exactly how i did it,[],r/loseit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_m1560k,False,dark,0.89,,public,2412,30,{},52a4dae2-6c35-11e9-81f1-0acf30770a48,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2412,,True,,False,noflair,[],"{'gid_1': 4, 'gid_2': 1, 'gid_3': 1}",,True,,1615320812.0,text,6,,,text,self.loseit,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a little back story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i want to preface this by saying that i spent ten years subscribing to fat acceptance logic, ultimately believing calorie-counting etc. was incongruous with my feminist politics. i still believe fatphobia is a thing; i grew up in a family that was pretty fatphobic, and my parents were consistently derogatory about my aunt&amp;#39;s weight. she was morbidly obese and died of bowel cancer in her early 60s. her death was clearly related to her weight but at the time i was just sad that my dad couldn&amp;#39;t even have a funeral for her without commenting on her size in pictures. so i know the reasons why fat acceptance logic gets lodged in your brain - it&amp;#39;s angering that fat folks are dehumanised to the extent they are, and yes 100% i think that it&amp;#39;s wrapped up in misogyny. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, i was a tall and slender child but also gender-nonconforming from a young age. idk if i would consider myself trans now but i was always non-binary as hell as a kid. puberty and adolescence was extremely traumatic as a queer in a rural village with a lot of homophobia and transphobia at school. so i was body conscious as fuck and desperate to fit in, but always remember riding the wave of my slimness and tallness to insulate me from the additional shame of having excess fat. then i discovered alcohol in my early teens and drank consistently to deal with my sadness, for a very long time. at university this habit really took flight, and wasn&amp;#39;t helped by the fact that from my late teens throughout my 20s, i was a touring musician. i was in bars and venues almost every weekend, and often for stretches of a few weeks at a time. my eating and drinking habits went out the window, particularly because payments for gigs for many years incorporated drinks riders and buy-outs. i got used to the idea that i was just going to be &amp;#39;hench&amp;#39; or a &amp;#39;big, strong person&amp;#39;, which also fitted with my identity as a relatively masculine-of-centre woman who is also a guitarist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i discovered exercise properly at about 27, when i decided to try and learn how to jog for my mental health. i loved it but felt like i could never advance properly because i was always recovering from drinking or eating too much. i was vegetarian from age 20 to 29 so was also riding the wave of not eating meat, in terms of my weight remaining relatively stable, despite being above healthy BMI. then i met my partner, a food-loving canadian who is just over 4 years younger than me. she introduced me to the world of north american meat: chicken wings, ribs... we enjoyed ourselves so much as we were getting to know each other but good god: because i hadn&amp;#39;t eaten meat really as an adult, i was on meat holiday in a big way. i really went to town, and the whole time i was reading more and more fat acceptance stuff, learning from fat activists in my music scene and community, and touring more than i ever had in my life. i could sense myself expanding but was becoming gradually more alienated from my own body. at the same time, i was deepening my relationship to running, and even did a half marathon. so i was like: yeah, big people can be athletic! and eat whatever they want! woo! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOT woo. so from 28 to 31, i was doing a phd. the last year, in particular, involved pretty much sitting all day long. my eating habits and alcohol consumption were also beginning to make exercise less appealing and less possible; i would go for runs and have to break every 10 minutes. alcohol was having a cumulative effect on my mental health: i would have terrible insomnia, i couldn&amp;#39;t regulate my temperature, i was consumed with negative thoughts about myself, i had eroding trust in other people and was convinced this was just what life became when you lived in a capitalist hellscape. obviously i figured the best way to deal with these emotions and mental illness was just to....keep drinking whisky and eating M&amp;amp;Ms. and this is the kind of shit i was consuming on instagram too: that i should just listen to my intuition and eat whatever i want because that is self-care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so anyway, the pandemic comes along and me and my partner - who had become my wife by this point - go HAM with the ham, effectively. we literally spent two months playing breath of the wild, getting shitfaced and ordering mcdonalds. it was, tbh, really fun. but my head and my body were suffering. and i was starting to seriously dislike the way that i looked. thing is, this wasn&amp;#39;t a new thing: from childhood i had felt disparaging about my body for obvious reasons, and didn&amp;#39;t look in the mirror, for example, for years. when i did look in the mirror it was just for confirmation that i still sucked. but photos of me at gigs from before covid were unavoidable and i was progressively shocked at how overweight i looked. still, these thoughts and feelings came attached to inside voices shaming and policing me for critiquing my own body, as if i was being a terrible feminist and terrible ally to my fat friends. so i just buried it and continued on my merry, buttery way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in september i got my first full-time academic job and something in me just totally flipped. i realised i literally couldn&amp;#39;t continue drinking in the way that i had been if i wanted to do well as a lecturer. my wife and i were going through an eviction by an evil homophobic landlord that lived in the house above us and the stress of that was also pushing us more and more to shit food and the bottle. i realised i wanted more mental and physical resilience and to live my best life, if only to stick it to people like her. so i bought a scale for the first time in my life. i had not had a scale for my entire 20s, believing them to be oppressive to women and part of the auditing, measuring culture that contributes to stress and feelings of inadequacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, i got this scale and i stood on it and sure as day, i was 234 lbs. in my wildest imaginings of where my weight had gotten to, this was a distant number. i immediately took to the NHS BMI calculator and there it was: BMI of 32.7 (i&amp;#39;m a tall human), you&amp;#39;re obese baby. for the first couple of days i was in denial - i googled things like &amp;#39;i don&amp;#39;t look obese but BMI says i&amp;#39;m obese&amp;#39;. in my head, obese people looked like my aunt or lizzo. at the same time, i was also still struggling against the fat acceptance narratives in my head: i&amp;#39;m obese, isn&amp;#39;t this something i should celebrate or something? literally it makes no sense to me now but that is something i genuinely thought. i&amp;#39;m not exaggerating. so after a couple of days of denial, peppered with anger and dispair, i was just like: yeah i&amp;#39;m gonna have to fix this. i figured out that i needed to lose 56 pounds to get to a &amp;#39;healthy&amp;#39; BMI. when i told my wife this was the amount of weight i had to lose she was like shiiiiiiit. but she never doubted me. so here is how i did it: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how i lost 56 lbs in 5 months:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step One: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i quit alcohol. forever. i stopped drinking on september 13, and my wife did too. i don&amp;#39;t say this like it&amp;#39;s easy for people, but it&amp;#39;s hands-down the most important and best thing i&amp;#39;ve ever done for myself. i&amp;#39;m not gonna go on about the joys of being tee-total in this post (it belongs to another post probably) but there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that cutting out alcohol was one of the key reasons i was able to lose the weight i did. i also feel literally incomparably happier than i ever have in my adult life.  i still smoke weed - couple of tokes a night - so i don&amp;#39;t consider myself sober, but alcohol poisoned my belief in myself and my body and i knew if i wanted to take my health seriously it needed to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Two: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i quit animal products, as did my wife. a week after i quit drinking, i decided to go vegan. at first i was still eating honey but that&amp;#39;s gone now too. again, hate to be evangelical about this, but it made my body feel healthier than it ever has in my adult life. coupled with zero-alcohol, i started having the energy of like, my 9-year-old self. my skin youthened by about 5 years. seriously, my wife and i were like WE HAVE BENJAMIN BUTTONED OURSELVES WHAT IS HAPPENING. In the first two months of no booze and being vegan, weight melted off me. From 5 October to 29 November, I lost 19 pounds. i was exercising too, but not like crazy. nothing more intense than what i had been doing before, which was running about 3 times a week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Three: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i started actually drinking water. didn&amp;#39;t do that before, quite literally couldn&amp;#39;t understand the point (so alienated from my body and its needs). anyway, i started drinking at least two litres a day and it seemed to help everything on its way. also, my pee smelled better. win! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Four: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i unplugged from the internet. i deleted facebook and eventually instagram. this was an important part of my weight loss journey because i hadn&amp;#39;t realised how susceptible i was to group think, and how disciplining social media was about what constitutes a morally good life or decision. unplugging from social media feeds allowed me to start thinking for myself, and spending more time in nature. that said, i compensated for my lack of feeds by getting heavily into youtube. obese to beast (john glaude) *really* helped me. i got super into his videos and started to understand that, actually, as an anti-capitalist, i was doing worse for the world by supporting the overproduction of food - and the nutritional crisis of obesity that unfolds from it - than by self-flagellating for wanting a smaller body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Five: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after the initial weight came off, i had to develop a more serious strategy. first thing i did was actually log my calories. i used my fitness pal for this and it worked well, although i never weighed my food. so a lot of it was eyeballing/guess-work. i got round this by slightly overestimating amounts so that i could insulate myself from disappointment! anyway, without my fitness pal i would never have worked out that actually olive oil isn&amp;#39;t inherently good for you. prior to this i would happily use a cup of oil in a salad dressing. so i started switching things out and becoming a bit more inventive: i would use vinegar bases for dressings, and use tahini to thicken it up instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Six: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i started doing body-weight training instead of running. this was partly because i ran too much one week and gave myself a hip flexor injury. so instead, i started doing HIITs and lots of planks, bridges and the like in the park in the morning. this made my body feel strong and i think sped up my metabolism. eventually, i mixed bodyweight training and running during the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Seven: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i committed to a daily morning practice of food, movement and meditation. without alcohol I was able to go to sleep more easily and wake up more easily. as a result, I was able to gradually get to morning wake-ups at 6am (i had NEVER been a morning person because of alcohol and anxiety but had always dreamt of being one). i have eaten the same breakfast every morning for five months: oatmeal with agave and either half an apple or blueberries. in some ways i credit oatmeal for being my gateway drug to a healthy life. oatmeal powers me up and 45 minutes after eating it, i started going out and exercising, followed by a few minutes of meditation. this routine allowed me to start my day intentionally and with kind words to myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Eight: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i ate a cheat meal at least once a week. often this was a proper cheat meal, e.g. vegan fried chicken burger, giant cookie, fries, soda. i continue to do this every friday and the only thing that&amp;#39;s changed is that, as my body gets healthier, i actually have much less desire to eat oily food. still, for me it&amp;#39;s been important to have an evening of semi-indulgence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Nine: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step Ten: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i ate loads of fibre. this is easy to do when you&amp;#39;re plant-based, but i also went for way more fibrous carbs. i starting making brown rice, sweet potato or quinoa my carb base, and eating it with loads of tempeh or tofu, tahini-based sauces and dressings, lots of green veggies like broccoli and spinach. tbh this is the food i love anyway, so i always felt satiated and satisfied. this diet hugely helped me exercise - i would never feel sleepy after meals (had just thought this was what happened to everyone after eating), and instead would feel energised. almost like... food can be fuel? &lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s the climb&amp;#39; &lt;/p&gt;

I know if I had seen a post like this in July I would have completely ignored it, so I don't really know if I will help anyone, but please see a doctor if you are interested in losing weight before you change anything. If you are at a healthy weight already, you are probably absolutely fine the way you are. Not eating enough can really damage your brain and body, even if it's not a huge caloric deficit. 

If you are going to do it anyway without consulting a doctor and/or your parents, PLEASE look out for some warning signs I should have paid attention to:

\- Constant body checking

\- Wanting to eat less and less every day and feeling successful if I ate less

\- Being at war with myself if I ate more than I had planned

\- Thinking that I had do wait until I was thin to do certain things or wear certain clothes

\- Prioritizing weight loss over everything and obsessing about it

\- Constant food thoughts

And if you experience ANY of these things or something else you're not sure about, please please tell someone IMMEDIATELY before there is a chance for it to get bad.

I lost a fair bit of weight in my recent years (80lbs or so), I'm a 20yo man.

I went a date with an older friend  from a little after highschool and she made a comment  ""you're  completely *different*, it's so good\*"". I haven't changed since then, I just lost weight. Its still me\*.

It  sucks realizing that everyone who will be with you wouldn't give you  the time of day before, and would return to not giving you the time of  day if you gained it back.

What Are some clear benefits you have noticed after losing some weight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am 21 year old male, who have been overweight for the most part of my life. I managed to lose some weight in 2015/2016, but this last year or so I have gained 20+ pounds. I have never been truly lean and I have always been over my ideal weight, but this time I am more focused since I know I have managed to lose some of it. But I know I need to lose more of it now since I had a BMI at 30-ish when I started. I have so far lost 3-4 kg or so this last 40-50 days or so. But right now I am feeling very unmotivated and I need some motivation to keep going. Any help appreciated! Love this community!&lt;/p&gt;

I found an unwavering motivation to deal with obesity and change my lifestyle permanently after receiving a diagnosis of mild non-alcoholic fatty liver 2 years ago. I spent my pandemic isolation (I live alone) making getting healthy my main focus. I read and watched a lot on the subject, and seriously focused on what I needed to change in my life. (I was also dealing with depression and anxiety at the time I began my journey).

My changes to date have been almost completely diet-related. I removed most processed food and all forms of sugar from my apartment. I cooked one-pot meals and froze them in individual portion sizes so something healthy was always available when I needed it. I made big multi-ingredient salads and kept them in the fridge to grab during the week. I switched to a diet of vegetables, whole grains, beans and legumes, fruit (mostly berries), all kinds of nuts and seeds, frozen and canned salmon, canned tuna, chicken and turkey (white meat), and sometimes extra-lean ground beef when I really wanted a hamburger! (I still haven't been able to open that tin of sardines, haha). I learned to bake whole grain bread. Anything I made was weighed for calories/portion size. I'm lactose intolerant and finally cut out dairy. I figured out which other types of foods were causing my IBS symptoms (also diagnosed in March 2019) and cut them, too. It was a process. I aimed to stay in a range of 1200-1500 calories a day and kept track of what I was eating in a food diary, especially to see where I was falling short nutrition-wise, and most of the time I needed to increase the number of veggies I ate. I didn't order anything from restaurants because I wanted to make sure I knew what I was eating. (I don't drink so I didn't need to consider that issue.) I also compiled a binder over time of healthy recipes I actually loved that I knew fit my caloric requirements. I take an Omega 3 supplement and much vitamin D3, as well as calcium if I don't drink enough non-dairy milk in a day to reach 1200 mg. Oh, I should also mention that many of the meals I cook are hot and spicy because for me it just makes eating healthy so much tastier!

The other important aspect has been positive self-regard. I have been gentle with myself and included the expectation that dips in my progress would be part of the process from the outset. If I plateaued, I just told myself that things would start to move again, and focused on eating healthy. If I felt like eating more I did, and I would literally say (out loud) to myself that 'of course you can have more food!'. After a while, my sugar cravings, which were A HUGE HUGE HUGE issue for me, disappeared. Visiting family for holidays etc. was (and is) a challenge but I'm so focused on my goal that I have been able to stay on my plan.

So the great news is -- I went for an ultrasound last week and my liver is now completely normal!  I am soooo happy and relieved! My new goal this spring is to gradually replace most of my calorie deficit with exercise so that I can eat an amount closer to a maintenance weight. I have started a walking/eventually running program, and have a goal to add weight training and some yoga later on.  I would really like to find a group I can go hiking with once group activities are allowed again! 

The last 2 years have been a time of major transition for me. This September, at the point at which I hope to reach my fat loss goal, I will be starting a research MA! So excited!! Although I'm 51, my lifestyle is definitely on par with that of a broke student but I love it. My depression is gone. If it returns, I'll continue to be gentle with myself. Anxiety will always be part of my life.

,loseit,"And I was wrong. I'm 28F, 5'1"", and as of today, I weigh 187.8 pounds. I feel awful and hate the way I look. I have no energy or motivation for anything. I'm so upset with myself for letting it get this bad.

In 2017, I got up to my old HW of 174 pounds. I felt awful then and decided to start counting calories again and to go for more walks. Over the next couple of years, I very slowly lost around 30 pounds and felt great. I still wanted to lose some more weight to get into a healthy BMI and feel even better about myself, but I was really happy with my progress. I successfully lost weight and kept from gaining it back for around 2.5 years and I was certain I'd never see my HW ever again. But, as I'm sure is the case with many other people here, I could not predict the toll that a pandemic would take on my mental health and motivation.

I did pretty well for the first few months of the pandemic. I had gained a few pounds over Christmas and gained a few more going into the summer, but I was still exercising and trying to eat fairly normally. Around June or July, a switch flipped – perhaps that was the moment that it really sank in that the pandemic wasn't just going to go away in a few weeks. I went crazy, eating everything I'd ever craved and then some. I stopped counting calories after the numbers from my binges started to make me feel awful about myself. I stopped exercising, both out of laziness and out of fear of getting too close to other people outside. I kept telling myself I'd have one last day/weekend/week/month of binge eating and *then* I'd start over. I did this despite knowing that those thoughts are a trap and rarely turn out to be true. I did it all despite knowing that I'd end up where I am now, obese again and feeling worse about myself than I ever have before.

So here I am now, nearly 15 pounds above my last highest weight. Not only did I see those numbers again, but I surpassed them. As the scale has crept towards 190 pounds, I've realized that 200 isn't that far out of reach. I can hold a few cans of soup while standing on the scale and easily see 200 at the end of the day (I know because I tried). I always told myself that I'd never let myself get to this point no matter what – that if I ever neared 200, the numbers would be a wake-up call that made me turn my life around. It doesn't feel as clear-cut as I thought it would, almost like I've become numb to the numbers. Maybe it's just easier to see higher numbers when it's a slow rise from one day to the next. Either way, I'm not happy and I can't continue like this. My options are to either stay on my current path and end up morbidly obese and even more miserable, or to make changes now and work on being healthier.

Starting today, I'm tracking all my calories again. I'm going to ease into it – this week, I'm not going to stick to a budget so strictly, just track and notice the patterns. Next week, I'll start trying more seriously to stay under budget. It's the end of the day now, but I'm going to start going for walks again starting tomorrow. This is a big step for me – recently, I've been feeling so horrible about how I look now that I've been afraid to go out for walks in case someone sees me. But I know that's ridiculous. I know no one judges me as harshly as I judge myself and that the only way I can be active and feel better about myself again is to get back to the activity that I used to enjoy the most around a year ago. In a few weeks, I'll also start to incorporate some bodyweight workouts again. I'm going to cut out alcohol (which always makes me feel like crap anyway) and slowly start to cut down on processed foods.

I'm basically going to do everything I did last time. I think I did everything pretty well before. Losing the weight slowly through small changes is what made it so sustainable, and I believe it would have been sustainable long-term had the pandemic not happened. I felt like I could have sustained my lifestyle throughout any type of hardship, but, like most people, I didn't think something like the last year would even be possible.

I've had enough crisps, chocolate, pizza, McDonald's, and chips over the past year to last me a good long time. I'll still eat those foods occasionally, but I can definitely stand to stop eating them every day from here on out. Here's to the next weeks, months, and years ahead.

The person along with them told them “omg you’re so rude” and as I kept walking the kids voice echoed “fat fat fattyyyy!!” You never know what people are going through. I have no one to tell this to because everytime I’m fat shamed in public my mom thinks I’m lying or I’m exaggerating the situation. Yes I am fat and I’m trying my best to become healthy. I’ve been eating at home and cooking my own meals alongside trying to be more active. 

Things like this just put me in a deep depression and discourage me from even trying. It’s hard enough. I’m obese so I’m starting out with simple walking until I’m physically able to do more than that. I know people say why do you care so much what people think?

,loseit,"I'm sure most everyone on this sub can relate to how humiliating and shameful it is to see a doctor when you're overweight or obese. The first time I cried at a doctor's office was when I was 12 years old and the doctor told me that the darkened skin on my neck and inner elbows was a warning sign for developing diabetes. She was very kind and offered me helpful solutions to get my weight under control but I was terrified to think that the disease that killed my grandma might be in my future. A pattern developed after that: I'd go to the doctor, be told that my weight was dangerous and I was getting sicker, I'd try to lose weight, be successful for a while, and then go back to old habits. Rinse and repeat.

It wasn't until I was about 22 or 23 that it finally hit me that I was headed down a dangerous path. I'd reached 400 pounds, was pre diabetic, my blood pressure was climbing, and I had sleep apnea. I knew within a year, maybe less, I'd be diabetic, on blood pressure medication, and using a CPAP machine. And I was in my early 20s! Funnily enough, as much as I had grown to hate doctors, it was doctors that ended up scaring me enough to take charge of my health.

I had gastric bypass when I was 24 years old. I completely changed my lifestyle, started counting my calories, exercising, and working closely with a dietitian and exercise trainer. My hard work paid off and two and a half years later I'm down 276 pounds.

I had my first doctor's appointment last week since reaching my goal weight and for the first time I wasn't scared. I wasn't uncomfortable. I wasn't ashamed. The MA put the blood pressure cuff on my arm, saw the 110/60 and said ""wow, that's really good."" I stepped on the scale and wasn't brought to tears by the weight that popped up. The doctor felt around my abdomen and said ""I thought your liver might be a bit enlarged but it's not, you're just so skinny now."" The lab technician drew my blood and instead of having to to poke me five times because my arms were so covered in fat and I was dehydrated, she got me easily on the first try, said my blood was flowing really well because of how hydrated I was, and made a comment about my ""teeny tiny arm"" when she was wrapping me up. My blood tests came back and everything is normal. 

Sure, I enjoy the way I look now. I like how I feel in smaller clothes. But the greatest gift I've given myself is the gift of health. I'm no longer afraid of diseases or dying as a result of my weight. I know I have a long life ahead of me and this doctor's appointment has helped me take a hard look at my accomplishments, which I don't do enough.

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I enjoy the way I look now. I like how I feel in smaller clothes. But the greatest gift I&amp;#39;ve given myself is the gift of health. I&amp;#39;m no longer afraid of diseases or dying as a result of my weight. I know I have a long life ahead of me and this doctor&amp;#39;s appointment has helped me take a hard look at my accomplishments, which I don&amp;#39;t do enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll probably never love doctors but it&amp;#39;s such a gift to no longer live in fear of seeing them!&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"Hi everyone, I’ve been working out for 8 weeks now, 7 days a week. My workouts are usually 30 mins of strength training and 30 minutes of HIIT training on my peloton. In the last 54 days I have had around 6 rest days, some of which were active recovery (going for a long work or a leisure cycle or some yoga). I was sick with sinusitis and still worked out.  

In this time I’ve eaten between 1700-2000 calories, the past 3 weeks have been closer to 2000 calories because I’m getting kind of annoyed with everything and I’m adopting a little bit of a fuck it mentality because I’m frustrated. 

In this time I have definitely gotten stronger, I am beating personal bests, I’ve developed mad determination but I haven’t achieved ANY fat loss. I have some silly body fat scale (we know how inaccurate those things can be), I have apparently lost 3% body fat, gained 3kg of muscle and my visceral fat has gone down from 10 to 7. The scale has shifted from 82 to 80.5 in 8 weeks. Not even 4lbs? All these stats sound great but my waist measurement has not changed by one inch and I still look exactly the same, I feel stronger and I am breaking personal records but my body has not changed. 

I’m only trying to lose the last 10kg and with intense daily exercise my maintenance cals should be around 2500, even in my “bad” 2k cal day should still result in a deficit.

,loseit,"So, I've lost a lot of weight. Close to 70 pounds since this time last year. I've had issues with yo-yo dieting in the past, I've been making sure to go slower this time and make it sustainable.

Now, I'm in a healthy weight range. On the last ten pounds. Holy hell, this past month...the inability to feel satiated. It's unlike anything I've had while dieting now or in the past. I've implemented diet breaks throughout my process, however, now even that isn't helping. I'm wondering if I need to make them last longer, maybe instead of 3-5 days, 7-10? Those have been helpful mentally and getting rid of this in the past, but now, not so much.

I still found myself fixating about food as if I had just ran 20 miles and hadn't eaten in two days. I drink plenty of water, with my activity level a gallon a day on average. I also have been doing IF.

So, I'm lost. Is...is this life now? I can't imagine maintaining like this. Coping before wasn't great but still fairly easy eating the right things. Yeah, a twinge of hunger here and there but that is to be expected. I genuinely can't describe what it has become, other than the bane of my existence and the most annoying shit ever. Has anyone else gone through this, after getting to/close to a healthy weight range or after dieting for so long? I figure one of those is the culprit, but I don't know.

,loseit,"This is a 'weekly' post for the Runners of LoseIt. 

All  levels of runners are welcome -- from brand new first timers to experienced marathoners. Please feel free to come in and share, ask questions, whine, post NSVs (non-scale victories), etc. There are a lot  of great runners on this sub and lots of experience and help to share.  Plus, it is also more fun to share regularly how you are doing with  others going through the same challenges and experiences.

This post is mostly for sharing details of running this week, your first run, running related NSVs, questions, PRs, etc.

In  addition I will ramble on about some topic that is helpful to runners,  usually new runners, to help people along. This week -- running gear!

Running Gear

You really don't need much to go for a run, but there's a lot to be gained by adding a few running equipment, accessories, and tech. There's all sorts of things you can bring along on a run --

* Phone (and keys) Holder/Belt
* Headphones
* Watch or Tracker
* Heart Rate Monitor
* Stride/Form tech
* Running Power Meter

I'm going to talk about the top four items via my own choices. I've not widely tested any of this stuff, but I have arrived at stuff I really like and make running better for me. 

# Phone Holder - Amphipod Airflow

[https://www.amphipod.com/products/holders/music/electronics/airflow-endurance](https://www.amphipod.com/products/holders/music/electronics/airflow-endurance)

I know, I know, it's fanny-pack-esque. But it has all the following things going for it -- 

* Holds a Phone + Keys + Credit Card/Money - ample, secure storage. 
* Hides easily under my shirt - It lays flat. I've tucked it under my shirt or in my shorts without issue.
* Adjustable  - set it to a point where it stays put and I will not budge for hours. 
* Comfortable - The elastic is wide and stretchy, never pinches. 
* Durable - mine is still going strong after 4+ years. 
* Reasonably priced.

# Headphones - Panasonic RP-HJE120-D Wired Ear Buds - Orange

[https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/dp/B003ELYQGG](https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Headphones-RP-HJE120-K-Ergonomic-Comfort-Fit/dp/B003ELYQGG)

* Cheap - $USD 9. 
* High Quality sound
* Different ear piece sizes for perfect fit
* Lots of great/fun colors -- like my favorite orange. 

I love music when I run. I enjoy solid sound quality, and like to turn it up nice and loud with excellent base. I've tried Bluetooth earbuds and they either work well, but are expensive (and I lose/break them in no time). Or, they are cheap and disconnect or have sound quality issues. Also, I don't need another thing to charge. I'm fine with wired ones but I know many aren't. I wear my wired ones with the wire running under my shirt. It can be bother when I am completely drenched with sweat -- but then again, I'm completed drenched at that point. 

I listen to music off an iPod Nano. It sounds great and is easy to operated on a run. It's light enough that it is not an issue in my pocket. I sometimes run sans phone -- so I can't use it for music reliably. 

# Watch/Tracker - Polar Vantage M

[https://www.polar.com/us-en/vantage/m](https://www.polar.com/us-en/vantage/m)

Polar is in the pack of second-runners in the running watch tech space after Garmin. I started with Polar and I've stuck with it. I like the Flow website and the simple, sport specific design of the product. 

Why do I like it -- 

* Ease of use - start a workout with a press and hold of a button most of the time. 
* Lots of sports profiles - I've used Running, Hiking, Walking, Indoor Rowing, Yoga, and Strength Training in the last 30 days. I've used 20 or so sports profiles over the last four years. 
* 5+ days on a charge. I hate charging stuff all the time. Nearly a week per charge is great for me. 
* Building workouts like Intervals/Repeats are easy and fast.
* Provide workout ideas if I am don't have a plan for the day -- suggests running more, strength training, or flexibility/core/support workouts and then provides the details and timing right on the watch. 
* Built in Running Training Plans for 5K, 10K, Half, Marathon. 
* Great support. I've had my Polar Watches have issues and got a free/hassle free replacements with what appears to be a new watch. 

If I had an Apple Watch I likely would use that over this but I enjoy the sport-centric nature of the Polar. 

# Heart Rate Monitor - Polar Chest Strap

[https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/h10\_heart\_rate\_sensor](https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/h10_heart_rate_sensor)

Chest heart rate monitors are way more stable than most other options. My one other go to is an arm (not wrist based) optical strap like the Polar OH1/2 Verity. But optical trackers are slow to track to your heart rate from my experiences. The chest strap is fast and tracks way quicker. 

There's lots of great choices in chest straps from Garmin and Wahoo and others.

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to** r/Loseit!

&amp;#x200B;

So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why you’re overweight

&amp;#x200B;

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before You Start

&amp;#x200B;

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tracking

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

&amp;#x200B;

# Creating Your Deficit

&amp;#x200B;

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Exercise

&amp;#x200B;

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Crawl, Walk, Run

&amp;#x200B;

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Acceptance

&amp;#x200B;

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.

Its not a big deal as iv had a couple break throughs the last week that kinda just hit me . I want to share as im fcking proud of myself .





1) I broke up with feeling guilty about thinking , wanting , craving , making and eating/not eating . Im not going to feel guilty bout it anymore as its pointless . I have to eat to live  its how humans fuel our bodys its that simple . But i want to enjoy food again eat what i like , love and crave with no guilt so i if i want cake il track it and amend my day to fit it in as why not . 





2) I realised i have created routine in my life of being a housewife ( not married tho ) . I should say for years we have been unsettled with lifes been hectic due to outside influence but now we are very settled and calm . I started by making a list of daily cleaning tasks then weekly and more rare tasks like every few months . Iv stuck to it since the start of the year . And a couple weeks ago i started zone cleaning to get to those cleaning jobs we forget or put off . I feel like a proper adult for once as my house is getting a deeper clean than ever before . And iv stuck to my new laundry system.





3) I i decided to only control what i can control . Due to sharona issue i cant learn to drive but i can make daily habits so when i do learn and i finally get a job il be prepared. So every dang day i shower ,  brush hair , clean teeth do skin care ( due to a bad day I might of  missed a day a week but i havent since i started posting here ) then i put on the jewellery that iv always said when  i work il wear it daily so i am and finally i put slippers on i know there not close to shoes but close enough to form the habit .





Slowly slowly im forming new habits i now only drink water ,  i choose to get up and do my workouts even if im swearing at myself for it . I always said this is a lifestyle change so that includes healthy habits and thoughts .




Iv also choose  my march goal which is simple to be GRATEFUL for the food i have . I might not have much money but im privileged to be able to afford  acquire and prepare food . Im going to be more grateful that i can do all that . Btw im not religious.

[March 2021:](https://i.imgur.com/DtLCnas.jpg) [98.5kg/216.7lbs](https://i.imgur.com/49SArMS.jpg) 

Today is my anniversary of when I first got serious with dieting and losing weight, so I thought it would be a good idea to share my journey so far and the lessons I've learnt over the last 6 years. Before I saw success though I struggled with losing weight for over 5 years, always having bursts of motivation to act or grand fantasies of impossible situations occurring that would fix my problems. Diets never lasted more than a week. 

In March 2015, after some challenging goals in my life turned out not so hard to accomplish, I decided to try losing weight for longer than a week. As each week passed I progressively got more involved in the process; starting using MyFitnessPal, clean eating, no soda and signed up to a gym. It was surreal and I thought I was unstoppable. 

In the 8 months of losing 40kg/88lbs I had been extremely strict on myself, so strict that food was not enjoyable. There was no creativity or variance, I was just on the grind waiting to reach my goal weight with weekly weigh-ins and my food logging streak keeping me in check. So inevitably it all started to fall apart.

The first big hit was losing my 180 day streak on MyFitnessPal. Next I was just slowly adding back soda into my diet, not sugar free but the full stuff. After that I stumbled and started to yoyo between 106kg/233lbs and 110kg/242lbs, and slowly and surely the difference got higher and it became harder to bring myself to lose weight again. I eventually stopped weighing myself and started to slowly reintroduce all the bad food I had deprived myself of. It snowballed, slowly undoing all the good that I had done. It then reached a point where I stopped caring and I ballooned to 158kg/348lbs by August 2018. Nowhere during this point of time did I address my core issues with food and what I used it for, nor did I really know at the time what those issues were.  

Come one Saturday morning in August after having a 7 day streak ordering takeout I weighed myself and saw 157.9kg/348lbs and I knew I never wanted to see myself ever reach 160kg/352lbs and again picked myself up and started trying to lose weight again. Steeling myself and fought through the inner turmoil and torture of failing at something I had previously succeeded in. Parents were worried as they saw the patterns, this was just another “burst of motivation” and in a week I’d be back to old habits. But I went beyond a week, then it was a month and by Nov 2018 I was down to 144kg/317lbs

However I was just repeating what failed before, I had gone back to old tactics when I lost that 14kg/31lbs. No Soda, No Takeout, No Fun. So when a small vacation happened in November 2018 where there would be takeout, soda and fun I was hit with a dilemma. I came to a decision to just enjoy myself for the couple days away and get back on task after it. However that never happened and I fell again and just like that I was on my way back to 158kg/348lbs. By mid-February 2019 I was 147kg/323lbs, doomed to be in this never ending loop till I had an epiphany; Why was I trying so hard? Why was I trying to be perfect at losing this weight? It was clearly failing. Why don’t I just take it slow?

March and the anniversary of starting this back in 2015 was fast approaching and I had the brilliant idea of competing with my former self but I knew I couldn’t be as strict, I knew I had to take this easy. So I tried losing weight with as little stress as possible. I guesstimated calories, tried to eat within 2,000 kcal a day and never went stupid. Kept a cheat meal once a week so I could still enjoy takeout, started to weigh myself weekly and I still allowed myself to drink diet soda, keeping vices that made each day bearable.  

I then lost 20kg/44lbs in a comfortable 23 weeks, losing about ~0.9kg/2lbs each week. My first roadblock was week 24 where I didn’t gain or lose anything, while this deterred me I knew I wasn’t trying my hardest and knew what I could do for results. I double downed, started counting calories again with the LoseIt App and tried to find out what went wrong. Over the next 2 weeks weight loss resumed till I stumbled into another problem. I found I was eating too much of my budget for breakfast/lunch and didn’t feel satisfied with what I had remaining for dinner. This is when I tried out intermediating fasting. I did a 16:8 split and it helped me budget out each meal and allowed me to dip my toes into meal prepping. This roughly lasted 6 weeks before I went on holidays. I was sad to break the schedule but after the vacation I felt I had learnt the lessons I needed and stopped fasting. 

After coming back from vacation this time and going overboard with food I expected to see a weight increase but surprisingly didn’t. This gave me some ideas and got me into researching “re-feeds”. The outcome was a refeed once a month where I had no calorie limited, I didn’t count the calories of the day and a day where I could go stupid and try and satiate any of the cravings I had been having the past month. These refeeds aligned with board game nights with mates and made it so I could enjoy good company and good food at the same time without regret. What made me start doing these was realizing that there was no deadline to losing the weight, there was no reason why I couldn’t just enjoy myself for a day. At worst it would set me back a week at most and in the grand scheme of things that's nothing. 

By the end of 2019 I had matched my personal best of 106.3kg and was ready to embark into uncharted territory until Christmas holidays set me back 3kg/6.6lbs….however instead of getting deterred I problem solved and saw what I could change or add....I had been squandering my gym membership, which I had been still paying for monthly since 2015...It was then, 5 days out from the new years, where I started a dumbbell full body workout routine. I increased my calories to 2,000/day and every other day I’d workout. 

I’ve done my best to work out at least 3 times a week and all I can think is I should have started earlier. Working out has been incredible. Between the post workout feeling, being able to eat more, better quality sleep, waking up being easier and just feeling better has been so surreal. Watching my arms get bigger, feeling stronger and seeing my man boobs transition from saggy tits to actual pecs has been insane. I made an incredibly smart decision by buying adjustable weight dumbbells and a bench before the pandemic hit that allowed me to explore the wonders of weight lifting. Right now I’m enjoying low weight, high rep push/pull body workouts with low rest time and doing my best to avoid leg day due to working in a job that has me on my feet for 6hrs at a time. I won’t get too into what I do for exercise besides that due to how limited my knowledge is, but will list some books and resources that helped me at the end of this post. 

Covid finally caught up to me in [mid-2020](https://i.imgur.com/ocAtkNO.png) when I went for a holiday at home during June, I was at my lowest ever of 97.6kg before this and just lost motivation and sight of my goals (mainly due to losing myself in a mmo). History was repeating itself and what unraveled my success back in 2015 was going to happen again as I ended the year at 106.6kg, this terrified me. To combat this I used the power of a new years resolution to kick myself back awake and I attempted a 30 day challenge to remain on task. This involved daily weigh-ins to keep me accountable, a new gym workout routine and being back on a 16:8 split intermediate fast. The 30 day challenge only lasted 22 days due to a holiday but it was enough to get me back on task.

Currently I’m back on being relaxed about dieting. I’m not tracking my calories but generally know how much I can eat a day. Speaking of eating, I despise food prep. I hate having to think about what I have to eat, spend time acquiring the ingredients and cooking it up. The early parts of dieting was all about finding quick things to make but even that got tedious. I solved this by paying the premium and have a weekly subscription to a meals service (mymusclechef) that gives me 12 meals/week, 2 meals/day and a day off for a cheat meal, these meals cost around $10 AUD each and average around 550 calories per meal. Breakfast was solved with a 300~ calorie breakfast bar and then later replaced with oats. I still have my vices of too many Pepsi max cans a day and 1 250~300ml can of full sugar energy drink. I then augment my day with a whey protein milkshake and some packaged snacks, usually aiming for around 160~180g total protein/day. 

Example Day:  

Breakfast: 450 calories~

- Protein Bar/Cooked Oats with milk + Energy Drink 

Lunch: 500~600 calories

- My muscle chef meal
- Can of Pepsi max (1~3 calorie diet soda)

Dinner: 500~600 calories

- My muscle chef meal
- Can of Pepsi max (1~3 calorie diet soda)

Snacks: 400~500 calories

- Whey protein shake
- Cheese and Crackers on the go/assorted packaged snack
- Can of Pepsi max (1~3 calorie diet soda)

So this is about 1850~2150 calories, maybe peaking towards 2300. With how much I exercise I could probably get away with eating more. Ideally I should be cutting out the soda and energy drinks but I keep my vices to prevent myself from going insane, I don’t drink alcohol so I have room in my health budget for things that aren't good for me. In addition I have a Vitamin D, Omega3 and multivitamin supplement. What I listed here is what I found best works for me after years of experimenting and now I have a diet that I enjoy, can consistently do every day and is malleable for change. A cheat meal day usually replaces the two muscle chef meals and the rest is the same.  

In closing, the real challenge I faced losing weight is the mental strain and burden that one goes through when losing weight. To me, food was an avenue of escapism, when life got too hard to handle, food was there with its warm embrace to make me feel good even if temporarily. It got to the point where I even started feeling at ease after I ordered takeout. While what I’ve written are the things I did to help lose weight it hasn’t expressed the mental battle within myself that has taken place and still takes place to this day. I’ve been to the darkest parts of my mind twice and managed to pull myself out of it, the second time was a damn miracle but that inner voice inside my head wouldn’t shut up about wanting to keep trying, and that’s what I did. I kept trying. I took 12 years of trying but I eventually found my way. 

Rules I've incorporated into my life.  

1. Don't view dieting as punishment. I still have vices such as an energy drink and a couple cans of Pepsi Max a day. 
2. Strive for consistency over perfection. Don't let a bad weigh-in day halt or revert progress, same goes for blowing your calorie budget or moments of weakness. A 1-day set back is nothing.  Don’t be defined by the mistakes you make. 
3. Think about it everyday. Meal prep, gym, logging. I weigh in daily now to always keep myself accountable.  
4. Make time for cheat meals (1/week) and cheat days (1/month). Allow yourself to enjoy all types of foods. 
5. Don't set deadlines for goals: Losing weight is already stressful as is and if you find yourself not on ""schedule"" to be a set weight at a set point in time it just leads to unnecessary stress or worse, punishing yourself to try and reach that goal. Making your goal weight a week or two later isn't the end of the world.
6. Diet is forever, what you are doing now is what you’ll be doing at your goal weight. So find something that works, is comfortable and malleable. 
7. Make time to workout, it's literally the greatest thing ever.

&lt;p&gt;Today is my anniversary of when I first got serious with dieting and losing weight, so I thought it would be a good idea to share my journey so far and the lessons I&amp;#39;ve learnt over the last 6 years. Before I saw success though I struggled with losing weight for over 5 years, always having bursts of motivation to act or grand fantasies of impossible situations occurring that would fix my problems. Diets never lasted more than a week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2015, after some challenging goals in my life turned out not so hard to accomplish, I decided to try losing weight for longer than a week. As each week passed I progressively got more involved in the process; starting using MyFitnessPal, clean eating, no soda and signed up to a gym. It was surreal and I thought I was unstoppable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 8 months of losing 40kg/88lbs I had been extremely strict on myself, so strict that food was not enjoyable. There was no creativity or variance, I was just on the grind waiting to reach my goal weight with weekly weigh-ins and my food logging streak keeping me in check. So inevitably it all started to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first big hit was losing my 180 day streak on MyFitnessPal. Next I was just slowly adding back soda into my diet, not sugar free but the full stuff. After that I stumbled and started to yoyo between 106kg/233lbs and 110kg/242lbs, and slowly and surely the difference got higher and it became harder to bring myself to lose weight again. I eventually stopped weighing myself and started to slowly reintroduce all the bad food I had deprived myself of. It snowballed, slowly undoing all the good that I had done. It then reached a point where I stopped caring and I ballooned to 158kg/348lbs by August 2018. Nowhere during this point of time did I address my core issues with food and what I used it for, nor did I really know at the time what those issues were.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come one Saturday morning in August after having a 7 day streak ordering takeout I weighed myself and saw 157.9kg/348lbs and I knew I never wanted to see myself ever reach 160kg/352lbs and again picked myself up and started trying to lose weight again.

My journey started about five months ago when I finally landed my first “real” job. I finished up my masters last year and was lucky enough to get a fulltime analyst position despite everything going on with covid. Landing said new job finally allowed me to take control of my shopping, my diet, and ultimately my health.

From a very young age, probably around 10 or so, I’ve been overweight. I’ve previously tried dieting and had some success back in 10th grade. I went from 275 down to 225 in one summer. However I didn’t learn anything about cooking or forming better eating habits and I quickly gained it all back when I stopped following the strict dieting book I was given. Because of this experience, I knew I had to approach things differently this time. Dieting wasn’t the answer, I needed to change my relationship with food, understand what was and wasn’t good for me, and form realistic and sustainable habits that would also enable me to lose weight. Put more simply, my mantra this go around is “developing sustainable habits, not dieting!”

Back to the journey! With my newfound financial freedom and control of my food, I started by replacing unhealthy food choices with healthier options, i.e., instead of having two sandwiches with some chips at lunch I would have two sandwiches with a side salad, and then I moved on to having just one sandwich with some fruit and a side salad, etc. I kept making small changes like this for most of November but I wasn’t keeping track of calories or anything like that, just trying to alter the way I ate and the foods that I ate. At the beginning of December, I started noticing that my clothes were feeling a bit looser—things I had no longer been able to wear suddenly fit again. This inspired me to finally weigh myself and make things ‘official’. On December 11th, I got on the scale and damn near died from what I saw. I was expecting to be in the 270-280 range given that it was my previous highest weight and surely I didn’t think I could be above that. But, as you probably noticed by the SW at the top, I was a whopping 311! This was a major turning point for me. I become very depressed for a few nights then that depression quickly turned to anger—anger at myself for letting things get so bad—and then ultimately the anger turned into motivation.

With my depression/anger induced motivation in hand, I decided it was time to take things up a notch. I started looking into resources on how to change my diet, lose weight, etc. which is how I ended up finding this subreddit. Ultimately, I knew CICO was the way to go for me. I invested in a food scale, downloaded MyFitnessPal, and went to work. Since December 25th, just two weeks after I wanted to give up, I have weighed myself every single day to capture my weight trends and logged every single meal I have had. I’ve had weeks where I didn’t lose any weight, I’ve had days and meals where I broke and ate food I know I shouldn’t have, but I have stuck with it despite any obstacles and now I’m down 36 pounds in less than three months! Seeing my weight in the 270’s again, and soon to be 260’s, is really helping me learn to love myself again. My confidence is skyrocketing and my motivation is at an all time high!

&lt;p&gt;My journey started about five months ago when I finally landed my first “real” job. I finished up my masters last year and was lucky enough to get a fulltime analyst position despite everything going on with covid. Landing said new job finally allowed me to take control of my shopping, my diet, and ultimately my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a very young age, probably around 10 or so, I’ve been overweight. I’ve previously tried dieting and had some success back in 10th grade. I went from 275 down to 225 in one summer. However I didn’t learn anything about cooking or forming better eating habits and I quickly gained it all back when I stopped following the strict dieting book I was given. Because of this experience, I knew I had to approach things differently this time. Dieting wasn’t the answer, I needed to change my relationship with food, understand what was and wasn’t good for me, and form realistic and sustainable habits that would also enable me to lose weight. Put more simply, my mantra this go around is “developing sustainable habits, not dieting!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the journey! With my newfound financial freedom and control of my food, I started by replacing unhealthy food choices with healthier options, i.e., instead of having two sandwiches with some chips at lunch I would have two sandwiches with a side salad, and then I moved on to having just one sandwich with some fruit and a side salad, etc. I kept making small changes like this for most of November but I wasn’t keeping track of calories or anything like that, just trying to alter the way I ate and the foods that I ate. At the beginning of December, I started noticing that my clothes were feeling a bit looser—things I had no longer been able to wear suddenly fit again. This inspired me to finally weigh myself and make things ‘official’. On December 11th, I got on the scale and damn near died from what I saw. I was expecting to be in the 270-280 range given that it was my previous highest weight and surely I didn’t think I could be above that. But, as you probably noticed by the SW at the top, I was a whopping 311! This was a major turning point for me. I become very depressed for a few nights then that depression quickly turned to anger—anger at myself for letting things get so bad—and then ultimately the anger turned into motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my depression/anger induced motivation in hand, I decided it was time to take things up a notch. I started looking into resources on how to change my diet, lose weight, etc. which is how I ended up finding this subreddit. Ultimately, I knew CICO was the way to go for me. I invested in a food scale, downloaded MyFitnessPal, and went to work. Since December 25th, just two weeks after I wanted to give up, I have weighed myself every single day to capture my weight trends and logged every single meal I have had. I’ve had weeks where I didn’t lose any weight, I’ve had days and meals where I broke and ate food I know I shouldn’t have, but I have stuck with it despite any obstacles and now I’m down 36 pounds in less than three months! Seeing my weight in the 270’s again, and soon to be 260’s, is really helping me learn to love myself again. My confidence is skyrocketing and my motivation is at an all time high!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see what all this journey holds for me and where I’ll be months from now, even years, but I’m happy be finally become a part of this community and get my story out there!&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"Hi loseit.  I've been hanging out with the OMAD (one meal a day) guys and been on keto diet for 4.5 months and absolutely crushing it.  I'm 31M 5'8 and was 200 pounds in October. I currently weigh 166 and have a goal weight of 160.  I've had an interesting battle with my weight since I was a kid, and won't go into too many details, but I have been as heavy as 225 at my worst in highschool and college, 145 pounds at my skinniest when I was around 25, and got back to 200 during quarantine.

I've been in great shape doing crossfit at 170 pounds, skinny fat shape (hello, this is me), and also just fat fat.

I have never been able to get rid of my midsection - it causes me to hyper focus on it and the more weight I lose honestly the more body image issues I get and I have struggled in the past with disordered eating to try and maintain weight as I went crazy when the scale started going up.

This is me getting started again in October 2020

This is me today.

I feel great, my face gains are crazy, and my clothes actually fit again.  I feel and look younger.  I personally get frustrated looking at these pictures though as all I want to criticize is my lower stomach, and every time I'm shirtless in front of a mirror I am staring constantly at my midsection. My girlfriend thinks I get vain when I lose weight, but in reality I'm just staring at my belly.  I dislike how much my ribs show and in general just what my silhouette looks like, especially when part of me looks under weight and the other part I still see my 200 pound body.  

I have put in years of effort and have definitely gained, lost, and regained my entire body weight over the last 10 years as my weight has fluctuated.  It is so frustrating to never have been happy with my body as a teen or adult, and also feeling like I've done permanent damage to myself when I got fat as a kid.  

I guess my question is if this is REALLY this important to me do I need to finally just have a consultation with a plastic surgeon, or is there something I can do that will finally correct this?  Would this be skin removal, or is it stubborn belly fat?  I have seen before/afters of people who were 300+ pounds and their skin/stomach doesn't look like mine - maybe my skin just isn't as elastic as others.

I have been what I would consider underweight at 145 pounds chasing a flat stomach that I want and I just can't seem to get there no matter what I do.  I am approaching my 160 pound goal weight, and I couldn't be happier with my results and my health, but I seriously am so hyper focused on my belly and love handles and once in my life I'd like to have something closer to my ""ideal"" body.

I managed to maintain the 113lbs until October 2020. This is when another lockdown happened in my city so gyms closed and I lost my job. Also, the weather started getting cold and I didn't want to go outside because I HATE cold weather. I basically started sitting at home all day, everyday. Around this time I started steadily gaining weight until Feb 2021 when I reached 129lbs. I'm so devastated. I went out and bought some dumbbells, kettlebells, jump rope, ab roller, etc. so I could start working out at home. 

In Feb, I started working out for 30-60 minutes a day/4-5 days a week. So far, I see a big difference in my glutei (which I'm very happy about lol) but I have not lost a single pound. I don't understand how that is even possible. Maybe I am eating more than I think but I just don't understand what happened to my body. I feel like even if I eat one cookie, I gain weight. It's so discouraging for me when I feel like I had a great week in terms of working out and eating well, but then I weigh myself and nothing has changed. I used to have a bad relationship with the scale 2 years ago as I would literally weigh myself 3 times a day. I don't want to go back to obsessing over numbers and starving myself eating 800 calories a day, but I keep thinking about how badly I just want the weight to be gone. I lost the weight before but I feel like this time is 100x harder and I cannot figure out why. It's really starting to affect my life as I hate leaving the house because I don't want people to see me.

I welcome any advice on healthy ways to cope with these feelings. I've never experienced re-gaining weight and I feel alone. If anyone has any advice or insight, it would be greatly appreciated.

It&amp;#39;s really starting to affect my life as I hate leaving the house because I don&amp;#39;t want people to see me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome any advice on healthy ways to cope with these feelings. I&amp;#39;ve never experienced re-gaining weight and I feel alone. If anyone has any advice or insight, it would be greatly appreciated. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel this way about myself but I feel trapped and completely unmotivated. Please, if anyone can help...&lt;/p&gt;

People are into fit people, people are into fat people, I know. But I know I am so so much happier seeing myself overweight and looking good than loose skin.

I never ever EVER posted on here. Never really been a part of the community at all. Honestly, the only posts I've ever read were on nosleep and that's just because a friend would recommend it.

My story, as it goes. I'm 27. And a half. My parents were married at this age and pregnant with me. I just think about it from time to time. How I still am not doing what I want to be doing because I keep postponing it with one excuse after the other.

I graduated from university a while ago. Said goodbye to my friends, who live all around the world. Could hardly meet up with them before this whole shebang, imagine now.

My area of expertise has nothing to do with what I've wanted to do since the age of 7. Plus, it's like...impossible to get a job without another specialization.

I left my job in November. No, please, rejoice for me. It was an unbearable situation where I was given the responsibilities of an owner without the perks. So, underpaid, underappreciated, and overworked. They still like me. Met them in the street the other day.

I left because I made the decision to go back to get an MSc, despite my first degree being in languages. So, got a lot to study for. I also got another job three days after I left the other one.

I haven't had a break since 2016.

I've always been a little chubby. Not recognizably so, I was just more rotund in areas where my peers were childlike. Got down to model-like weight when I was 16. Then it was time to apply for colleges, closed myself in my room for days on end, gained weight, went to live off on my own without any roommates, said goodbye forever to healthy eating and exercising habits, watched a LOT of tv shows, got roommates, went to live even further away from home, on my own but surrounded by friends, got slimmer. Came back to my hometown, away from my friends, got depressed, lost family members, got even more depressed, started overworking. Overeating.

""I'll stop once I'm down working there!"", I used to say. Well that didn't happen now, did it, cause the stress is now work+university. I chose this.

My main problem is, when I focus too much on my ""list of things I must do to secure a life for myself and my parents"", I get away from my social life and that sets my mentality into this loop of ""I'm not good enough"" and what does that even mean? Good enough for myself since I set the standard.

We're all overweight in my family. The only one who's been saved is my puppy.

My problem is I've made myself addicted to sugar. I adore chocolate above all else, and I cannot stop myself from having it if I know it's in the house in one form or another, be it a bar or cookies or hot cocoa.

So now my excuse for reaching age 27 without having taken proper steps toward my actual goal is because I'm 30kg overweight.

Because I'm 30kgs overweight I don't have a relationship.

Because I'm 30kgs overweight I don't post pictures of myself on social media.

Because I'm 30kgs overweight I don't feel like I deserve the happiness I'm aiming at.

Reaching my goal I fear won't be the solution to it all, but it sure will provide levity to my situation. So why am I unable to say no when a big plate of carbonara is put in front of me?

Why did I feel like having 8 nuts and hot cocoa after JUST having had lunch?

Why was I unable to stop myself?

It will take months, but I know that I don't want to look at my birthday pictures with repugnance next year. So I decided that these little updates will be my way to hold myself accountable.

,loseit,"Hello all. 

I have recently decided to take my health seriously for the first time in a long time. I started at 310 lbs and have now lost almost 20 lbs, I’m 6 foot 3, male and 24 years old. There are a couple healthy changes I have made to my diet including limiting meat and animal products which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while for environmental reasons. Watching what I eat and counting calories has shown me just how bad I was eating before so I focus now on making meals that are high in fibre and greens. I get my protein from meat substitutes and high protein legumes. 

When I started this journey I began by accepting that I had an unhealthy relationship with food. I was a “food addict” if you will. I have been able to limit my intake of unhealthy food and treat it as a recovering addiction for me and thus far I’ve been successful. I’ve not developed a hard limit on calories, most days I try to stick to roughly 1500 a day, sometimes I eat more than that up to 1,800 and I try not to have less than 1,500. I feel satisfied with the food and haven’t noticed any major changes in how I feel. 

My concern is according to the scale I’m dropping about 1-2 lbs a day doing this. My scale measures body fat and tells me I’m dropping mostly fat, less than a pound of muscle which could be a measurement error and  my body fat percentage has decreased by 3.7%. I feel like I’m eating better in terms of nutrients but dropping 1-2 lbs a day has got me concerned. 

Am I being safe? Should I do something else?

Thanks.

I read all over online that lifting and eating a heavy protein diet will slow down muscle loss but like I said before, it didn't really prevent it.

-Also, when I'm done losing my pounds and getting to my goal weight, what should I do to start gaining muscle back without also gaining fat back? Should I just increase my calorie intake to a 500 surplus daily of the healthy foods I'm eating and increase the protein intake to about 200g per day?

-Does losing a pound of muscle and a pound of fat mean that I actually lossed more fat than muscle? I ask this since muscle weighs more than fat on a mass scale.

In the past I've followed keto (worked well for my weight management). The burger wagon strolled by, a move back to the parents and ""eh mom made something"" and the habits breezed slowly out the window.

Bought a house with my boyfriend, started doing weights. We had a huge argument resulting in a separation for 6 months. Exercising and weights were abandoned (I was near or beyond the threshold of creating a habit), I didn't bother cooking for myself but didn't eat junk. Salads and a protein source for dinners, the same breakfast and lunches, kept an eye on calories and was in a deficit. Believe I was in the 145ish range. Felt good, clothes fit nicely.

Resolved things with my boyfriend and the habits flew the coop. Yup the 6 months of them, gone like a fart in the wind.

This summer marks the 2nd summer of eating ""normal"" foods and being content with what goes in and doesn't come off.

Stats: 32F / currently 200lbs (90.7 kg)/ height 4ft 9in ( or  145 cm) / very sedentary  job

About 7 - 8 years ago,  I started  my weight loss journey  following loseit and 90daysgoal subreddits  as guides to help me manage. I did really well over that year or two and was only about 10 lbs (was at 133 lbs or 60.3 kg)  from my absolute  goal, and felt amazing minus the fact my heart rate while hiking could be very high.  I met my current  boyfriend and switched companies to further my career; which included a lot of travel. For a period  of time.

Fast forward  a bit to we moved and since then I noticed my drive, my eating habits, and my movement  deteriorated  to point i am officially at my highest weight, and I mentally feel drained. I am  trying  to see someone for my mental health as I think I finally burned  out. (I have  a lot I deal with in my home band work life, and both sides basically tell me to fix the other side,  so I can focus properly.) Personally  I just want like 6 months off on a beach doing nothing,  but that is not realistic, so I'm trying to self help myself, on top of trying  not to worry about my partner  as he struggles  with online learning  as someone  who deals with anxiety, and depression who's counseling support team disappeared nearby the beginning  of COVID, so I'm his sounding board again. 

On top of that I work an office  job that has high workloads and expectations  this time of year, and I feel very underpaid for. These affect my mental health, which in turn affects my drive and increases my junk food cravings  and refusal to really try to make food (so I lean on my classics, bread, minute rice, and frozen items like chicken nuggets, or stuffed  chicken breasts. I don't want to make my simple salads. Or track anything,  even though I know it'll help in the long run. I'm fighting myself  here, and am trying with just simply trying to get back to tracking alone.

The worst of all of it though and the spot I really want help  in right now is my body feels so stiff. I can barely do chores without my lower back killing me. A 15 min walk is even hard on my lower back. I think I need to stretch my hips, and top of thigh (not sure the name of the top of thigh muscle as I think sitting shortens that one). I tried to look up stretches  but most are not  ones I can even get into the position  of at this time.  My belly is too big so I don't get a good range or form. 

What are some stretches you recommend  someone to try?




TL;DR - Reached the most weight I ever had. I know I have  to fight myself on many items like my food choices and intake. But I really want to get back to walking, but need help with stretches to ease lower back/hip pain. Body stiff from long hours sitting and inactivity.

Belly weight makes found stretches hard to do in a good form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick edit:// as I see a potential trend to yoga happening, I want to also ask, what are some go to stretches for quick breaks during the day ( think cubicle/ not much space stretches) that you found helpful?&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, from the title you can see I’m 18,5’9 and 90kg. Over lockdown I put a stone and a half on and it’s primarily fat. Over the last 3 weeks I’ve been eating 1,500 calories a day (to maintain it was something around 2400) , I used my fitness pal and this told me I would burn 0.8 kg a week using this.

I mainly eat protein and carbs for dinner/lunch. fruit and veg for breakfast, I also have 1 cheat day a week but I only eat up to my calories which will maintain my weight on the cheat day.

I have also been exercising 4 times a week, usually a 30 min bike ride, mostly up hill.

It’s been 3 weeks and my weight has been fluctuating between 90-91kg, I have lost no weight at all and I see no change in my weight.

Am I expecting too much too soon? Is the cheat day ruining my progress? I’m sorry for the long post I just feel like I’m doing something wrong.

A: Following a five day gym program that aims at progressively getting stronger each week at the four main lifts (Bench, Overhead, Deadlift, Squat) while doing some accessory work. I'd say each day takes me 40-90 mins to complete.

This behaviour happens with both takeout food and home food, probably spawning from people telling me i need to eat more because I'm tall when i was a teenager.

I lost 30 lbs (yay!) last year. Super excited, I busted my butt to learn how to eat healthier without going on a diet, exercise 6x a week and run 5Ks for fun, and I'm working on the daily to better my mentality as I'm on a journey to lose another 20-30lbs this year. (For stats: I am F/5'4"" currently at 168lbs and looking to get down to a health BMI around 140 or below.)

Until I went shopping this weekend for the spring and still had to pick up size 12 shorts and an XL hawaiian shirt. Bum-mer.

After going from 200 to 168 and baggier clothing, I thought I'd be at *least one* size down. Nope. Still the same size in clothing. And for some reason, it felt like I could just say 'fuck it' and go back to my old binge-eating all week / no working out ways. What was the point? I wasn't a single-digit size like I'd hope I would be. Nothing changed.

Then I took a hard look at myself and did my workout / planned the week ahead for meals / decided to make a reminder in my phone to up my protein intake and look up pre-workout mixes to help with my spring training for a faster 5K.

Because I had to remember that toxic mentality of comparing absolutely ridiculous American sizes for clothing did not equal my worth in my achievements. It doesn't negate the fact that I can do HIIT for an hour and my core strength has greatly improved. It certainly doesn't mean the past year of working on myself mentally and physically didn't matter. It also doesn't mean I won't eventually see my belly 'disappear' -- it took years to form, so it will take years to leave.

So today I'm back on my calorie deficit (it was my birthday last week so I gave up some food slack to enjoy it), I start Week 5 of the Heather Robertson workout program, &amp; I'm considering going for a quick mile run after work to celebrate the new weather.

,loseit,"Hi! I want to hold myself accountable in my weight loss/ fitness/ health journey so I’m posting my story here (hope that’s allowed!) :)

So I am a 25 year old woman. I am 5 ft 2. I was always a kind of chubby kid, and it really set in during puberty. I went through a phase of hating my body, then came to love and accept it in my late teens. My weight has always fluctuated but usually sat around 170lbs. In the first few years of university I gained a few pounds, but when I was 21/22, I got really into the gym and healthy eating and lost the weight, back down to 170lbs. 

I know 170lbs is still overweight for my height. My waist was 36 inches and around my tummy (across my bellybutton) was about 40 inches. I had a bit of a tum but I didn’t mind it. I was confident and happy in myself at that weight, was eating healthy and felt good. 

Then the lockdown happened. Here in Ireland, we have been in full lockdown pretty much for an entire year, with a tiny break last summer. And it has destroyed me. We’re not allowed further than five kilometres from our homes, and all gyms are closed. I lost the will to exercise because I was depressed and anxious, I started eating really really poorly, my posture got so much worse from being slumped in the couch all day (which only made me look even fatter). I didn’t realise how much weight I had gained until I tried to fit into a dress at Christmas time that had fit me only the week before lockdown began in March 2020. It wouldn’t even close over. 

I’ve gone from wearing a UK 16 (or occasionally even a 14) or L to a UK 18, maybe even a 20, and XL. I had to buy all new underwear because my bras don’t fit any more. I’ve hit 200lbs and my waist now measures at 40 inches. Around my bellybutton is now 44 and a half inches. I have a double chin and a huge belly and bat wings on my arms and my thighs have gone super dimply. I just want my old self back. 

I don’t want to lose loads of weight. I don’t want to be “thin”. I just want to feel like myself again, fit into my clothes again, and feel confident and strong in my body. 

So I’m giving myself until July 1st. There’s nothing like a deadline to motivate me, and I’ll be out of work until then according to Ireland’s current lockdown trajectory. So I’m going to use my time wisely. 

I will try to drink three litres of water a day, but at least 2. 

I will go for a run or a cycle every single morning. One or the other. 

I will practice yoga every day. This will improve my posture, will help me features to help with weight loss, and will help me burn calories. 

I will walk everywhere that I can. I will go for walks at lunch time. 

I will eat as healthy as I can. I will take my probiotics and my vitamin supplements daily. 

I won’t be strictly tracking calories but I will be keeping an eye on them so as to not ever overeat by a huge amount. 

I will only weigh myself at the very end of the challenge.

Still, it's a devastating thing to hear.

I'm looking around for a nutritionist/dietician ever since it looks like I might have subclinical hypothyroid and my weight suddenly went up 5 pounds overnight without any change in diet. I'm not on any meds until I do a second test with my endo in April. 

I'm actually exercising more and logging my food more than I ever have in this pandemic and to see my weight go up is infuriating. My stupid thyroid is fucking my body and my mental health completely over.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking around for a nutritionist/dietician ever since it looks like I might have subclinical hypothyroid and my weight suddenly went up 5 pounds overnight without any change in diet. I&amp;#39;m not on any meds until I do a second test with my endo in April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m actually exercising more and logging my food more than I ever have in this pandemic and to see my weight go up is infuriating. My stupid thyroid is fucking my body and my mental health completely over. &lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"If you're anything like me (and one thing I have learned here is that there are lots of people like me) then you are less disciplined at the weekend than during the week.  I've been super-careful during the week and letting things slide at the weekends.

What I have realised is that this is skewing my numbers and putting me into a gain-loss pattern.

The most obvious thing is that I gain weight at the weekends.  I over eat, I eat too much salt and I gain sometimes as much as 5 or 6lbs in a couple of days.  

The next, less obvious, thing is when I get back on track, that weight drops off *fairly* easily.  Not super easily, but with fresh food, lower salt and plenty of water it's gone by Wednesday/Thursday.

The problem is, in my mind, I am therefore trucking along on Thursday, back to good losses and can ease up a little at the weekend...then, guess what?

The past 3 weeks or so I have ""plateaued"" only it hasn't been a plateau at all, it has been the gain-loss cycle described above.

This weekend I tried damage limitation - only one indulgent meal, very little snacking, plenty of exercise and hydration.  And I came through the weekend with no gain.  Now, I am back into weekdays with my set routines, training plan, pre-prepared meals etc and I should be able to parlay the weekend into a proper loss by Friday.

,loseit,"Hello everyone,

I am writing this post to thank the people that achieved what I've started and also to document my progress. I will update this post weekly mainly as a way to hold myself accountable.

So here's my journey and plan:
- I am currently 29 with a 6'0 height and 240 lbs. I've had excess weight as long as I knew myself and wanted to lose it before starting my 30s. I am planning to reach 200 lbs by the mid-summer and 180 lbs by fall.

- I will be limiting my calorie intake at 1500. As I am working from home, it is easier to cut calories as most of the time I am at BMR levels of activity. Also I've observed my food consumption and other than occasional fast food and snacks I am eating at a 2000-2200 level so cutting would not be drastic.

- Cardio - walk 6 days a week with at least 30-min per day with 3.5 mph speed. This is to lower my cholesterol, insulin resistance and boost endorphins.

- Weight training for 3 days per week. This is to improve my calorie deficit and also gain some muscular mass while lowering fat mass.

- No meals after 7PM, only water.

Overall, I've calculated to be at a 1000 calories deficit per day which should help me achieve my goals. One issue that is bugging me is my current meal plan macros are 25% fat, 40% carb with 1/7 of them fibers and 35% protein. Should I lower my carb gradually and increase my protein or would this be enough?


Also, would this weight change create saggy skin and how can I mitigate it?

I decided on Feb 2nd that something needed to change and I wanted to lose weight. I stopped drinking soda and stopped eating fast food.

I am 5'5 and weigh 190 pounds.

when I started losing weight it went well i lost 10 pounds quickly just be stopping soda. from Feb 2nd to March 1st, I went from 190 to 178.4 pounds. What has been killing my motivation, since march 1st im hovering around 178-179 (let me see 177 once!!!) so I decided to add whey protein and a multivitamin, which I added on march 5th. Taking whey protein twice daily and light cardio 30-60 mins a day. but im still 178.4 pounds. should I not take whey protein? not sure what else to do

Edit: since people asked about calories 

Going to add on, I am not really counting calories I changed the way i eat (prob not the smartest) but i went from drinking 32-60 oz of soda a day and eating fast food sometimes twice a day. and currently im eating the following (not counting calories)

breakfast - oatmeal / shake

snack - apple or yogurt

lunch - plain turkey sandwich with a slice of cheese / yogurt

I’m currently going through quite severe depression in addition to a difficult to treat chronic health disorder which causes me lots of pain and discomfort and I have approximately zero energy to exert on anything beyond getting out of bed and using the toilet.

Washing up in particular causes me a lot of pain. I am not exaggerating when I say that I am looking for recipes with zero prep and cooking that are vaguely healthy, not excessively high in calories and can sustain me if eaten only once a day.

I am trying to lose weight because now I’ve become diabetic and I am terrified of organ damage but I don’t have the energy or strength to cook healthy meals for myself.

I'm hoping this sub can give me some input as to what I may want to change or eliminate first. I eat most of the sugar before 4pm, and the types of sugars vary. Really appreciate any advice.

A current weekday usually consists of the following before 4pm:

Morning gym shake: 1.5c milk -26g, banana 14g, 1 scoop protein powder 0g, 0.5c oats 1g, 1tbsp peanut butter 2g

Kombucha (a treat I guess, but I like the gut biome qualities) 16g

Fage greek yogurt with honey (I eat half the honey) 20ish g

A Bays english muffin with 2 eggs, smoked salmon, dill, red onion and a small smear of cream cheese - 2g in the Bays but refined carb

Usually a Larabar as a snack during the day -17g

Lunch usually something like a shredded chicken breast or tuna sandwich on whole wheat bread, tortikla, or mixed with brown rice ramen noodle serving, veggies, little mayo etc

At night my wife cooks and there's usually some type of ""healthy"" carb like lentil or chick pea pastas, almond flour turkey meatballs, 90/10 beef dishes, lean meats, healthy soups, veggies etc.

I almost never eats sweets like sugar, candy, etc on weeknights.

2-3 measured alcoholic drinks 4x a week. Cocktails on weekdays are dry (martini etc), do have craft ipas sometimes, and wine

6'3 195lbs normally, but right now ive been 205ish, but this is after I added the milk based gym shake in the mornings about 4 months ago.

Gym 5-6x a week, rigorous, capable of lifting heavy weight 250-300lb bench if maxing

Run 2.5 miles 4-5x week or swim 30min 4-5x week, one of the two

I cook and have cheat meals on weekend nights like Italian, pasta etc. 

I always considered my diet somewhat balanced and maintain a pretty good physique for 38yo male, but was taken aback that the weekday staples mentioned earlier were already in the 100+g sugar range and the national average is something like 75 for the day.

,loseit,"Hello everyone - just for general I am a 29 year old female my SW: 80 kg and my CW: 60 kg and my height: 170 cm. 

It’s been a long journey to get where I am currently (about two years) and a lot of mistakes such as starving myself to try and achieve my goals. I’ve recently started clean eating and weight lifting rather than focusing on extreme amounts of cardio and mass amounts of under eating and then binging over the weekend. 

I’ve always had a bit of an issue around calories. My fitness pal recommends that if I was sedentary and did nothing all day I would need about 1200 calories to sustain myself. 

I weight lift and do high intensity training at least 4-5 times a week and on average walk about 2 miles a day if not four sometimes. I’m also a secondary school teacher and have to move around my school to teach.

I currently max out about 1400 calories a day - is this enough or do I need to eat more? I also track my macros and try to make sure they are balanced as possible.

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long journey to get where I am currently (about two years) and a lot of mistakes such as starving myself to try and achieve my goals. I’ve recently started clean eating and weight lifting rather than focusing on extreme amounts of cardio and mass amounts of under eating and then binging over the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had a bit of an issue around calories. My fitness pal recommends that if I was sedentary and did nothing all day I would need about 1200 calories to sustain myself. &lt;/p&gt;

recently wondering if there’s a chance I have some condition that makes losing weight a real slog. Lots of details: 

• 2018: ~140lbs. 


• Across 2018, 2019: gained ~10-15. fed at my tech job for breakfast/lunch every day. did tend to make healthy choices there. 

• 2019: started Orange Theory 3-6 times a week religiously. I work a very sedentary job (software).  most athletic I’d been since high school cross country. on gym leaderboards etc. 150-155lbs. 

• Covid: Gained ~5lbs (no more OTF). eating quite healthy, 1400-1500 calories per day since I moved back home and could track EVERYTHING. I have a new scale, I weigh even my flax seeds and cooking oil etc. ~160 lbs through Halloween.

• Holidays 2020: fell off the rails but not any worse than previous years. gained 10-15. At 175lbs. Day after Christmas: wtf! revert to strictly 1400 calorie days. My 60 year old mom eats the same as me (I’m living with her atm). She’s sedentary. Like 1-2k steps a day. I start to walk 10-12k+ steps every single day, religiously (got Apple Watch at new year). some light lifting and/or 30 minute YouTube video twice a week (in addition to the walks). Religiously hit my daily watch goal of 45 min of exercise. 

Issue: weight is coming off at a glacial pace. At like 0.25-0.5 pounds a week if lucky. Lose It says I should be losing 2 a week! 

mom’s weight melted off, 15+  pounds in the same time frame with no exercise. I don’t eat back calories after exercise. 

I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been despite being way healthier than my 2018 self. so frustrated. hoped to be 170 at least, after two months.  

Like I said, I weigh EVERYTHING. Almost obsessively. 

Is there a chance I have some condition? Like I don’t burn as many calories as someone else just doing nothing? not familiar with conditions that might hinder weight loss. 

Currently have a heart rate of 50 when I sleep and rest, is that indicative of anything? At Orange Theory, I struggled to get my splat points (earned per minute of elevated heart rate over a threshold) even when running faster and lifting heavier than relatively fit people around me.

I started at 250 lbs on July 5 (6’/male). 6 days a week, my main meal is a salad with 6oz of chicken breast on it. Sunday I eat whatever mom cooks when I visit them for “family dinner”. Each of those bags is 18oz of grilled breast, so a standard week would see me going through 2 bags. On the day I’m finishing off a bag, I stick a new one in the fridge and it defrosts by the next evening.

I normally don’t get so much chicken, but I found a deal for 99c a pound at a local grocery store so I ended up getting 33 pounds worth. It’s probably a little excessive, but I know that I’m going to end up eating at all, so it only made sense to prepare in advance. I highly recommend a vacuum sealer if you don’t already have one… And of course, a food scale. [Here are some of the salads I’ve made](https://imgur.com/a/Rc5WFTu). I’ve found that the best thing to do is keep them interesting, so you don’t get bored eating the same basic thing every day.

To that extent, I’ve found myself using a lot of add-in’s. Walmart makes a “great value” brand topper called “maple glazed pecan pieces with dried dates and apples” ($1.89/4oz bag). Salad Pizzaz makes a number of great ones, like “raspberry cranberry green walnut frisco” (2.89/4oz bag). Nature’s Garden makes “savory salad topper with almonds, walnuts, pepitas, sunflower seeds, and chia cheese sticks”. I also recommend craisens… If you’re feeling adventurous, you can look for orange or strawberry flavored Craisins at Trader Joe’s. Other add-ins are Napa cabbage (I usually add this to each salad since it’s so low-cal), artichoke hearts, apples, berries, etc.

I used to tried a lot of different dressings, but I’ve pretty much exclusively limited myself to Newman’s Own lately. Their Ginger Sesame dressing tastes great, and is only 35 cals per 2 tablespoons. Their light balsamic is only 45c/2T. Also, I like “Bitten” brand’s creamy lime avocado dressing (45c/2T). The only word of advice I can give is to be very cautious when using dressings, because it’s easy to use regular regular dressing and completely defeat the purpose of eating a salad in the first place, since most normal dressings have around 150 cals per 2 tablespoons.

Anyway, I just wanted to share what I do that has been effective for me. I am 3 pounds away from hitting my target goal of 165, which will be the first time that I have weighed that little since high school. I’m in my mid/late-30’s now. I went from a size 42 waist to a 32. I’ve had to buy new clothes, new belts, and yes, new boxer briefs. That being said, it’s a very good problem to have. Once I hit my target weight I’m going to start exercising more and eating more food. 

I’ve limited myself to 1500 cals per day, every day. I’m going to bump that to 2000 a day once I hit 165 to see if that, combined with exercise, gives me enough energy to lift weights while maintaining a weight of between 170-180. I wanted to get to 165 so I could adjust my eating habits and find what number works for me, which I assume will result in a little weight gain while I get used to it (that’s where the 165 to 170 comes into play). 

 Anyway, if anybody has any questions, just let me know. I hope this has been of some help to someone. I never thought I could drop the weight I did - but I did.

2. We moved to a different state
3. I moved my father from his home to permanent assisted-living
4. I had to represent my sister in a civil court matter as her power of attorney

6. I had a major health scare that thankfully was only temporary and has been resolved

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to** r/Loseit!

&amp;#x200B;

So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why you’re overweight

&amp;#x200B;

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before You Start

&amp;#x200B;

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tracking

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

&amp;#x200B;

# Creating Your Deficit

&amp;#x200B;

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Exercise

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Crawl, Walk, Run

&amp;#x200B;

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Acceptance

&amp;#x200B;

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""/r/Loseit""&gt;r/Loseit&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  &lt;a href=""/r/Loseit""&gt;r/Loseit&lt;/a&gt; has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why you’re overweight&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Before You Start&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that &lt;a href=""https://tdeecalculator.net""&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tracking&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  &lt;a href=""/r/loseit""&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; recommends an app like &lt;a href=""https://www.myfitnesspal.com/""&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""http://loseit.com""&gt;Loseit!&lt;/a&gt; (unaffiliated), or &lt;a href=""https://cronometer.com""&gt;Cronometer&lt;/a&gt;.  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you&amp;#39;re eating is more important than what you&amp;#39;re eating.  Why?  &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU""&gt;This may explain it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Creating Your Deficit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  &lt;a href=""/r/loseit""&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Exercise&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

It makes people feel *awesome* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Crawl, Walk, Run&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Acceptance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will &lt;em&gt;struggle&lt;/em&gt;.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.

,loseit,"Hello everyone!

I started my diet back in January where I was 194 lbs and I’ve been fluctuating around 182 lbs for three weeks straight. I have been accurately tracking my calories (using a scale to the nearest gram) and logging everything into MyFitnessPal. I am confident that I have been eating at least at a deficit of 4000 cal per week ( and that’s rounding up all the calories to the nearest 100, the actual deficit is higher). Yet, my weight hasn’t changed at all. Sometimes when I weight myself first thing in the morning, after going to the toilet, I find that my weight is higher by three to five pounds. 

As for my training, I’ve  been lifting for five to six days a week for the past five weeks, and I can see changes in the pictures I have been taking. I spend 45 minutes on the elliptical six days a week, and I know I am going hard because by the end of it I am covered in sweat and don’t have the energy to do much (which walking doesn’t do for me). 

Theoretically, I should have lost at least three pounds of fat, but the numbers aren’t moving down, and it’s discouraging when I see that the number goes up on some days. Should I consider going on a larger deficit and up my cardio? Or should I wait it out for a couple of weeks before making any changes?

Here's my body. So i used to be a sedentary skinnyfat person many years ago before i started gymming, i still am skinnyfat but with some muscles. I never ate enough so i never really gained much muscles or increased lifts. Stuck in mediocrity. Always stuck at 20%. How do i get out of 20% BF?

My lifts are bench, 80kg 5 reps. OHP 50kg 5 reps. Row 67kg with knuckles forwards 5 reps. 8 good proper pullups. Deadlift is 120kg but i'm out of weights to put on it now. Squat is too embarrassing to tell. Biceps curls 10kg for 8 reps.

If i have calculated my diet right i get 2000 calories and 200 protein per day. My height is 184cm, weight is 90kg. I have gymmed for about 3 years, i don't skip gym days besides when i am sick which is like once a year.



My routine is: monday: 5x5 bench press/OHP (alternating), 5x5 row, 5x5 squat/deadlift (alternating), 3x8 clapping pushups, 3x8 biceps curl and on OHP days it is 3x8 lat raises
wednesday: 5x5 bench press/OHP (alternating), 5x5 row, 5x5 squat/deadlift (alternating), 3x8 clapping pushups, 3x8 biceps curl and on OHP days it is 3x8 lat raises

Hey guys. I’ve been losing weight for a good 4 ish months now and I’ve become familiar with how my body reacts when I eat a certain way or how long I hold water weight. Typically, I eat more around maintenance on Saturdays and I still lose a pound a week consistently. I usually gain like 1-2 pounds water weight after that said Saturday which I’m used to and it goes away after 2-3 days. However, I did my typical maintenance day Saturday and put on a bit of water weight, but that was gone by Monday and I was at my current weight. It’s now Tuesday and I stepped on the scale and I’ve gone up two pounds which is really weird for me and how my weight fluctuates. I’m not panicing too much because it’s probably just water, but I’ve been eating in deficit perfectly since Sunday so I’m confused why it’s jumped up all of a sudden.

&lt;p&gt;why does weight loss stop suddenly? i know i’m short and weight loss is already hard, but my running endurance is improving and its getting easier, i’m on a low cal diet and still the scale doesn’t budge. i’m not super focused on numbers, but i’d still like to see a general trend. do i increase exercise? i’m not sure what my next steps should be. thanks all and happy losing!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve got good news: I haven’t binged since my last check in! I have spent the last month going into a deficit and have lost almost ten pounds.



Now the bad news: I’m pushing hard, because I had blood work done and my a1c hit 5.7. I am officially prediabetic. I’ve spent the last month busting my butt to get this weight down. I refuse to become a diabetic. I refuse. I don’t want my daughter to grow up with her mama being type two. Hence the sudden weight loss. 


I am currently sitting at 212.4 as of yesterday morning.  I am trying to lose two pounds a week until I hit 200, then I’ll be happy with 1-1.5. 


I’m tired all the time and very weak. With my doctors monitoring me, I’m eating between 1400-1500kcal a day. I am just under 5’3 and female. It’s hard, but i have to do this. I miss feeling sexy. I miss my husband scooping me up. I miss being able to run and bike. (We’ve taken up both. I can do about a mile of each before I can’t breathe anymore.)

,loseit,"Last summer I did it. I hit the 100lbs lost mark. I made it from 283, to 183 which also put me - just barely - in a normal BMI. It took a year and a half.

Since then I've been struggling to lose the last 10-15 lbs I'd like to lose. My weight has been pretty steady around the 180-183 range, once dropping down to 177 but I always put those few pounds back on. Watching the scale go down that first year and a half was like a drug. It was what kept me going. Now that it's barely moving I've had a more difficult time. It's not just that. This past year has done a whammy on the positive and healthy habits I gained. Couldn't go to the gym, so I bought dumbbells and a yoga mat and started working out at home. That went great for a few months and then I got in a bad car accident. The concussion took 2-3 months to heal.

Worked on getting back to my exercise routine and then I started to have back pain (It ended up being a UTI that cleared up with antibiotics). 

Got back on track again, and then I got covid. Really really easing back into things after that. I had it a month ago and am pretty much  back to normal but I've read articles about people going too hard after recovering and then relapsing. I don't want to risk that.

But it's not just having the exercise. I am 'treating' myself way more often than I did in that year and a half. I know if I could just cut that out things would be better. I just ate 1000cals worth of jelly beans in one sitting. After Christmas, I brought a bunch of discounted chocolate. I always have the best intentions. I'll buy this thing and expose myself to this food trigger and I'll get better at my control.

It never quite works out that way.

I know I need to have self compassion for myself and not let things like this send me into a spiral, but it scares me. I was so fat. I know the statistics, most people gain it all back and more.

I went to the store yesterday to exchange a shirt and a pair of khakis. The khakis *technically* fit fine, but they weren't as roomy as I liked them, and I already had a shirt in that color.

A year ago, buying clothes was a **nightmare**. It was super stressful, and I ended up basically having a ""uniform"" - jeans, a tee-shirt, and maybe a flannel or hoodie. It was super hard to find clothes too - I often went store to store, picking up whatever stock they may have in my size. I also didn't feel super confident in what I wore, and my chances of getting properly gendered was probably a 50/50 shot.

As I've lost weight, I've started incorporating... fancier clothes? Not really fancy, but I'm wearing more button-ups and I've started buying actual pants. I've also been incorporating clothes that would normally make me dysphoric, like button-ups with tiny floral detail or more tailored pants.

And holy cow! I feel ***way*** more confident! Not just in how I look, but overall. I feel more confident speaking up in classes, walking to the coffee shop, going grocery shopping... I also get misgendered less! Nowadays I'm probably gendered correctly 80-90% of the time.

I will also say it's way easier finding clothes. When I went to the store yesterday I was actually kind of overwhelmed with choices for shirts! Pants are still somewhat tricky because of my height, but it wasn't like I only had a couple of options. I ended up also impulse-buying a sweater. It's not a sweater I'd normally wear, but I absolutely *love* how it looks on me.

My boyfriend started off really supportive of me trying to lose weight and eat healthier. It's been almost exactly a month since I started. Last night he told me something along the lines of ""I think it's really great that you're eating healthier and exercising and tracking your calories, but it's really starting to drive me crazy."" This is because he does most of the cooking but I have to scan the barcodes on everything and I'm like ""how much butter did you just use?"" or ""can I assemble my enchiladas? I need to weigh what I'm putting in them."" I don't mean to annoy him, but I need to know everything I'm putting in my body. He also won't measure things even though he knows I need to know how much it is. I don't think this is malicious. I think he just doesn't consider it, but it'll be something like ""hey, how's much cream cheese is in the sauce you made?"" ""Idk, like 2 scoops?"" Like great, I can barely estimate how much that means. 

Also, he makes eating less junk harder. A lot of people in this sub say if you don't want to eat something just don't have it in the house but I'm not going to dictate what my boyfriend can and can't eat. He has stopped getting hostess snowballs at least, which is nice. Thankfully I don't drink soda because there are literally 48 cans of diet coke in our apartment. A bigger problem than what he buys for himself is what he buys for me. The other night he bought me gummy bears for no reason because he knows I love gummy bears. It was really sweet of him but I don't want to eat candy right now.

Did anyone else have similar problems or have advice?

For the past couple of weeks my weight has been fluctuating and staying around the same place in a way that I have not seen through my entire journey of losing 60 pounds. 

 I’m including my weight log at the bottom to illustrate this better but I essentially feel as though I am not losing weight and not able to move onto the 220s and just continually moving up and down in the 230s. To give some context about my diet and exercise: I am a 6’2” on a calorie deficit and light exercise. I try to eat 2000 calories a day - sometimes I eat less than this but never more. I watch my sodium intake to reduce water weight (but honestly I love hot sauce so this is difficult sometimes and it may go over slightly 1-2 days of the week) I start out every morning with a walk that burns about 150 calories and I’ve started to jog as well. I very rarely have cheat meals (maybe once a month) 

My nutritionist told me that if I don’t eat my recommended calorie amount my body will retain fat, so I’ve started to try to get as close to that 2000 calorie goal as possible. I have also started jogging to build muscle mass so my body can metabolize better. Despite doing all these things that I did not do to lose my initial 60 pounds, I’m finding it impossible to move past 230. Please, if this is normal or if you have any advice whatsoever, please let me know. I’m feeling so stuck and feeling discouraged.

1 year ago I lost 14 kgs in 5 weeks with minimal activity and by simply eating a lot less and cutting out all junk food, and it paid off. I fit into all of the clothes I owned again and I was completely fine. During quarantine last year, I got lazy and slacked off a lot and I put on the 14 kgs that I lost plus an additional 2 kgs, so in total I gained 16 kgs, which is the most I've ever put on (I'm 22 years old). 

Now I know exactly how my body works, what I can and can't eat, what will ruin my diet and what won't, and so on.

I've been going to the gym now 5 days a week, lifting weights consistently for 12 weeks and I've made some significant growth in muscle, but my weight just continues to slowly go up and I have no idea why. I started the gym at 94 kgs and I now weigh 96 kgs. 

I know for a fact that my last 2 - 3 weeks of eating have either matched my eating from 1 year ago when I lost weight or it has actually improved in comparison.

I just checked again now that I know how to use them and apparently I&amp;#39;m at 19.3% body fat, and my bluetooth scale says 19.7%. I don&amp;#39;t feel like I&amp;#39;ve lost body fat at all, and I&amp;#39;m struggling now more than I have before and not sure what else I should be trying. Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"Trying to lose weight in the middle of a pandemic, while depressed, planning a wedding, and working a very stressful job is maybe not the best idea. Especially without much of a support system. Especially especially as a woman with a very small frame, so my calorie deficit may need to get fairly intense to hit my goal weight. But I'm so tired of feeling like I can't buy clothes because they all look terrible on me, and hating photos of myself.

Anyway. Week 1 was successful, I'd say! Lost a couple lbs, probably all water weight, but it was nice to see on the scale regardless. It gets harder from here and I'm hoping I can stay motivated for the year or so between now and when I want to hit my goal. I'm trying to be really easy on myself, not counting every single exact calorie and instead just giving myself a solid idea of my overall calorie intake for the day. If I go a little over, fine, no worries. I'll probably be a little under on a different day. I have a year, it'll balance out. If I get too exacting, as I've done in the past, I know I'll just burn out and quit.

,loseit,"Hey all,

So roughly about two week ago I posted this on the IF page and CICO page seeking some help, didnt really get a clear advice, so please read on and advise if you can.

Need some advice, I am trying to lose weight but whatever I am doing isnt working out.

Been in the gym for 5 weeks now, i have been tracking my food and I am getting in roughly 1400-1600 cals a day ( I am 6'4"" and 113kgs) and drinking 2L for water a day ...plus I am going to gym 5 times a week.... 3 days are cardio and 2 days are weight training.

My gym sessions are anywhere between 45-55mins and my bpm is between 135-145 through all my sessions ...I roughly burn between 650-800 cals in these session (all the data from my watch).

I take weekends off to rest and maybe enjoy 1 meal that is something like a burger, pizza, fried chicken, dumplings etc you get the point but its only one meal in the weekend of the type.

Doing 16:8 (16 fasting 8 eating)

But my weight is exactly the same and has not budged .... measurements around my arms, waist and thighs are no different either.

I cant figure out what I am doing wrong.

Adding to this - since posting this I increase the calories and am getting in roughly 2000 cals now ...have not seen an increase in weight yet, but I dont want that anyway.

&lt;p&gt;So roughly about two week ago I posted this on the IF page and CICO page seeking some help, didnt really get a clear advice, so please read on and advise if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need some advice, I am trying to lose weight but whatever I am doing isnt working out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been in the gym for 5 weeks now, i have been tracking my food and I am getting in roughly 1400-1600 cals a day ( I am 6&amp;#39;4&amp;quot; and 113kgs) and drinking 2L for water a day ...plus I am going to gym 5 times a week.... 3 days are cardio and 2 days are weight training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gym sessions are anywhere between 45-55mins and my bpm is between 135-145 through all my sessions ...I roughly burn between 650-800 cals in these session (all the data from my watch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take weekends off to rest and maybe enjoy 1 meal that is something like a burger, pizza, fried chicken, dumplings etc you get the point but its only one meal in the weekend of the type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing 16:8 (16 fasting 8 eating)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my weight is exactly the same and has not budged .... measurements around my arms, waist and thighs are no different either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cant figure out what I am doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to this - since posting this I increase the calories and am getting in roughly 2000 cals now ...have not seen an increase in weight yet, but I dont want that anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit - have taken measurements and everything is the same around arms, neck, stomach, thighs, hips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also did get my blood tested as well and everything came back fine with nothing wrong&lt;/p&gt;

Hey everyone! 
I’ve been a member of r/loseit for forever and actually lost some weight last year (was down to ~163 with muscle) until the pandemic hit and i gained around ten pounds and lost all the muscle i had worked for. 

I’m wanting to have an accountability group chat / partner to keep each other accountable for our weight loss goals, preferably someone around my age who is also a female and is looking to lose some weight. 

I’m currently 172lb and hoping to have a fat loss of around 1.5lb/week through better eating and exercise. I track my calories on the loseit app and try to work out a couple of times a week, but I always mess myself up on the weekends and eat way over my calorie budget.

,loseit,"Hi! I’ve been debating posting here for a while but I’m a 19 year old who is/was morbidly obese (BMI was over 43 now 38) and started the keto (though my version was more of a dirty version) back December 1st. I have been scared of diabetes and heart issues for a while now and realized I needed to make a change so I wouldn’t end up on “My 600lb Life”. I worked away from home for a month and practically lived off of Mountain Dew, Meijer cookies, and Burger King. I was extremely sedentary and realized I really was not getting any healthier.

As I stated previously, I started Keto but tried limiting myself to 35 carbs a day which f*cking sucked. I lost about 20 pounds which was wonderful but shopping for food made me so depressed. Once I plateau’d though, I got back on my bullshit and started eating carbs again. I was between 269-271 on my plateau but I luckily didn’t gain much weight after starting carbs again. I started my journey back up after a month long break and tried something new. I’m down to 257.6 pounds as I am writing this and it’s been approx. 2.5 weeks since I started back up. 

So what have I done?
Well my breakfasts consist of either oatmeal then a nature valley protein bar, or I’ll go more “traditional” with an egg, a slice of whole wheat toast, and a rice cake with strawberry cream cheese on it. I start my day off with easy calories to burn while keeping carbs the highest. Then I stop eating until 6-7 (generally I wake up at 11). I use this time in between to simply walk or just do whatever I need to do at my job (which fortunately requires standing).

Once dinner rolls around it’s usually grilled chicken or a chipotle bowl (with cauliflower rice). I eat a filling dinner and have been attempting to stop eating by 9:00, 9:35 at the latest.

I’ve been debating posting here for a while but I’m a 19 year old who is/was morbidly obese (BMI was over 43 now 38) and started the keto (though my version was more of a dirty version) back December 1st. I have been scared of diabetes and heart issues for a while now and realized I needed to make a change so I wouldn’t end up on “My 600lb Life”. I worked away from home for a month and practically lived off of Mountain Dew, Meijer cookies, and Burger King. I was extremely sedentary and realized I really was not getting any healthier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stated previously, I started Keto but tried limiting myself to 35 carbs a day which f*cking sucked. I lost about 20 pounds which was wonderful but shopping for food made me so depressed. Once I plateau’d though, I got back on my bullshit and started eating carbs again. I was between 269-271 on my plateau but I luckily didn’t gain much weight after starting carbs again. I started my journey back up after a month long break and tried something new. I’m down to 257.6 pounds as I am writing this and it’s been approx. 2.5 weeks since I started back up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have I done?
Well my breakfasts consist of either oatmeal then a nature valley protein bar, or I’ll go more “traditional” with an egg, a slice of whole wheat toast, and a rice cake with strawberry cream cheese on it. I start my day off with easy calories to burn while keeping carbs the highest. Then I stop eating until 6-7 (generally I wake up at 11). I use this time in between to simply walk or just do whatever I need to do at my job (which fortunately requires standing). I will not eat until I reach 10,000 steps... that is unless my blood sugar drops or I feel extremely hungry (not boredom hunger). If I want a snack I’ll eat carrots and hummus or cheese. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once dinner rolls around it’s usually grilled chicken or a chipotle bowl (with cauliflower rice). I eat a filling dinner and have been attempting to stop eating by 9:00, 9:35 at the latest. &lt;/p&gt;

As I was approaching the one year anniversary of my weight loss journey, I had a realization. For years I’ve been yo-yoing with my weight and every now and then, whenever I would get just a hint of motivation, the first thought that would always come to my mind would be “I’ll start on Monday”. The fact that it was Wednesday when I would said that obviously led me to other five days of eating crap. I mean I was totally justified, I said that I would start on Monday and it wasn’t Monday yet. And I wondered how I couldn’t lose weight, ha.

Now, I can say that I successfully shred 30lbs off my body, despite having a few binging episode and weeks (\**coff*\* months \**coff*\*, hello summer yes I’m referring to you) where I just didn’t feel like counting calories. So of course I slipped and had to get back on track several times. Which for the record I did, sometimes sooner, other later. But guess what?

I didn’t start *once* on Monday.

Don’t wait for a new week, new month or even a new year. I know that it sounds easier, hell I dare to say tempting. To get a clean cut, starting from scratch, like it would erase all those failed attempts. It might even feel like you’re getting a boost of serotonin from the mere thought of starting on a blank page. At least that’s how I felt. But deep down you know that it’s actually harder. Because you feel a lot worst if you screw up on that specific date.

What I learned during this last year, is that you have the power to trick your brain and decide where that blank page opens.

I wanted to give you guys an update from my last post!
(If there’s a better way to do this other than commenting on that post with updates, please let me know!)

I have seen a mental shift in myself that is subtle but feels permanent. I am essentially correcting myself every time I start to engage in negative self talk. I just put a stop to it and instead choose objectivity, acceptance, being gentle with myself, and finally trying to find something about myself I can feel confident about instead. 

Having body dysmorphia is so strange, because it has this element of gaslighting that makes you question both yourself AND the people who love you. If someone compliments my body and I can’t see what they see, it makes me feel like everyone is lying to me to pacify me, and it creates baseless resentment and anger towards that person. It’s so deep rooted and it’s so hard to rewire your brain if you struggle with it. 
I am a very reasonable, rational person and I’m not quick to anger or resentment or anything like that. But I have to check myself often when people compliment me, because I have been taught by so many that my body is ugly that I have internalized it. 

I’m just so proud of the woman I’m becoming despite those fucked up mental barriers that had the potential to destroy me. I am trying so hard to love myself deeply, intimately and truly.

Today I took this picture. I’m sure I’ve lost a few pounds since my last post (as I’ve been incorporating permanent eating, mental, and physical changes into my life) but that isn’t my concern at this moment.
Instead, I’m proud that I can look at this body, post it on the internet, and say to myself, “you are beautiful and your body is lovable. There are so many things about you that are lovable! “

That’s all! Thanks for reading. :-) 💕 so much love to whoever this finds.

&lt;p&gt;I’m just so proud of the woman I’m becoming despite those fucked up mental barriers that had the potential to destroy me. I am trying so hard to love myself deeply, intimately and truly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I took this picture. I’m sure I’ve lost a few pounds since my last post (as I’ve been incorporating permanent eating, mental, and physical changes into my life) but that isn’t my concern at this moment.
Instead, I’m proud that I can look at this body, post it on the internet, and say to myself, “you are beautiful and your body is lovable. There are so many things about you that are lovable! “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all! Thanks for reading. :-) 💕 so much love to whoever this finds. 
Keep going! You’re so beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

I am still way too heavy but I proved to myself that I can put the hard work in and now I believe I can go all the way to target weight by the end of the Summer.

Set goals, work hard, support each other and you will get your rewards!

&lt;p&gt;I am still way too heavy but I proved to myself that I can put the hard work in and now I believe I can go all the way to target weight by the end of the Summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set goals, work hard, support each other and you will get your rewards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS I am writing this in the bath tub after almost 3 hours on my rower.  I suspect it will still be a struggle to get out today 🤣&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: WOW so much positive feedback.  A couple of people messaged asking about the charity.  It&amp;#39;s Cyclists Fighting Cancer in the UK, they provide bikes to kids who have had cancer. My page is here if anyone wants to be a hero and push me over my fundraising target.  &lt;a href=""https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/lukepickering1978""&gt;https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/lukepickering1978&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have been feeling so down, lost all of my confidence, and ive been so desperate to lose the weight but i just didnt have the drive and willpower to do it. In January my partner began his weight loss journey, he has been eating clean and goes out running 3/4 times a week and so far has lost a huge 2st 7lb. Im so happy for him and quite envious, its seeing his hard work and enjoyment that has nailed it in my head that I am finally ready to start my journey. 

I have joined Apple Fitness+ and im really enjoying it at the moment, especially the dance workouts, they are so much fun. Surprisingly im really enjoying the clean eating too, something ive never liked before, which to me, shows that this time i am really ready for this.

My fiancee and I have been doing HIIT cardio and dieting the past 2 and a half months and seeing good steady weight loss (around 8-10lbs each), but we've gone kind of slow the last couple weeks.  I decided to recalculate our TDEE.

Using a fat caliper to calculate body fat %, we estimated that we were about 19% (me) and 26% (her) respectively.  Wanting to cut down that to a more fit range, we decided to recalculate our TDEE and found that I'm somewhere in the range of 1930 cal for maintenance, while she's at 1671 for maintenance.

We've been doing the TDEE - 20% for the past while and its been great though slowing down.  Recently we found a lot of places saying TDEE - 500 cal.  Which one is it?  Any other tips for consistently losing weight to get to a more lean body fat %?

Nothing crazy is going on with me, it’s a rather typical story: I was fit most of my life, I used food as a coping mechanism in my late teens-early 20s, and it hurt my body while also not helping my feelings.

&lt;p&gt;I increased my calories to the max level I could lose weight with. I included more whole foods and fiber. I took dietary supplements. I ate at different times at the day. Drinking more water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried numerous techniques. and I noticed this is at any weight. The same thing occurred when I was cutting at 220, 200, etc.  I was still hungry as complete hell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people genuinely feel almost nothing when they cut. My friends have no issue and cut with ease. Me? I&amp;#39;m always hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, by educating myself and having all the time in the world to meal plan and workout (a small personal benefit of the pandemic), things clicked this time and I managed to lose 80lbs between June 2020 and January 2021 ([before and after pics here](http://imgur.com/a/vophosD)). 

By the time January rolled around, my weight loss slowed to a crawl. Even as I continued to lower my intake in relation to my lowering weight, it became harder and harder to make progress. I was stubborn, though, and the idea of taking a break felt like giving up or giving in to laziness. Finally, I started to feel weak during workouts and my performance suffered, so I decided to eat at maintenance during February and resume my weight loss in March (note: I maintained my same work out routine the entire time). Now that I've been eating at a deficit for a week, there's a few things I've noticed:

* You know that woosh of weight loss you see when you first start out? You can do that again after a break. I lost 7.5lbs my first week back at a deficit

* ""Normal"" portions seem so much bigger after eating at a deficit for so long. I was able to eat a balanced diet while also drinking normal soda and eating candy a few times a week. It's reassuring to know that when I'm satisfied with my weight and eat at maintenance for good, I can eat junk food every once in a while because I know how to budget calories and adjust my other meals to accommodate for something high in calories

* If you're worried about gaining on maintenance, know that you can restrict calories for a couple of days and get back to your ideal weight. I gained 4lbs in February (probably mostly water weight), and it took two days to get back to my lowest weight

* It's easier to eat at a significant deficit when you have a defined timeline; sometimes it's hard to stick to eating at a deficit when you don't know when the diet is going to end and you might start falling off and going over on your budget. I know I was more and more resistant to eating below 2000cal/day as I hit month eight of weight loss. Now that I've taken a break, I'm comfortable eating 1700cal/day until my end date in June

* You may be hungry again when you end your break and are eating significantly less. Thankfully, that goes away, as it always does when you get used to eating at a deficit

* Eating at maintenance did fix my workout issue. I was more energized when I ate more, and now at my current calorie budget, I can still workout at peak performance 

In closing, hopefully this helps people who are stubborn like me feel better about taking a break from eating at a deficit. It's not giving up or wasting time - it may actually make the process MORE efficient! I'm also going to try out ""refeeding"" by eating a controlled increase of carbs every other Sunday in order to encourage leptin production, which will hopefully prevent plateauing. This is a different way of having a ""cheat day"" but staying productive.

Hope everyone is alright and doing great on your quests.

I'm not sure if any of you can help me, but I guess that, if I can't find the answer here, then I probably won't find it in any other community.

I'm looking for scientific evidence (scientific articles, studies) that are about measuring the calories spent by the body. How exactly are those calories measured? What techniques are used? Who did they study? When was it studied? What are the profiles of the people studied? How accurate is it? Are there discrepancies in the studies? And so on.

I expect, with the studies, to be able to completely understand HOW do they get to the point of indicating that a man in his 30 years and 170cm of height, sedentary, spends around 2.200 calories a day (just an example). I mean, I want to read the articles behind that.

Now, I know some of you might have a few answers ready, and I appreciate it. But for my particular quest, I need the scientific evidence - the studies, the articles, the results.

I realize that I’m not going to be loosing massive amounts of weight a week I just want to make sure I’m getting my correct calories in because I’m eating 2000 atm but Netting 1700 to 1800 with the calories burned but I could be at 1300 to 1500 calories in reality and that’s very low and explains why I’m struggling. I work out 6 days a week 2 times a day for 3 hours total. Any help would be awesome in information or where to find good information. I want to learn as much as possible. Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

630 pm : my brother and SIL came over on their way home and she is the world's best baker (honest to God my brother married Betty Crocker ) she made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies but she knew i was dieting so she made me some that were made with avocado , I ate 2 of them.

,loseit,"Hi everyone, I'm not sure where else to talk about this but considering it has to do with food and my diet I figured this might be an okay place.

Since my teenage years I've always very quickly felt weak if I didn't eat enough. Kind of light headed, but mostly that I just wasn't able to do much until I ate something again. I'm now 22 and this hasn't gone away, it's actually gotten a bit worse.

I've lost 20kg in the past 6 months and my diet is very different from what it used to be. I eat very little, but not because I want to. My body doesn't really give me the feeling of hunger anymore. Instead, I start feeling dizzy and weak. That's the moment I know I should eat. When I do eat, I eat what I can. It's not like I eat little on purpose, my body just can't take that much food anymore.

This has been very annoying, because if I don't get something to eat the moment I start feeling weak, it will only become worse. Eventually leading to me not being able to do anything, and having to be dependent on my boyfriend to get me something. This doesn't happen all the time, since I often just get food and it's okay. But this is still a problem. I start feeling weak so quickly, I don't feel like this is normal.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I can't help but wonder what's going on inside my body. I just want hunger cues again, not this annoying ""Oh guess I'm weak now"" feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Instead of getting hunger cues, my body starts feeling very weak, and the moment that happens I have to eat something immediately or I will be left not being able to do anything.

,loseit,"Hello, everyone. 

Last April, I weighed in at 174 pounds at 5’5. Since then, I’ve gotten down to 135 as of the end of February. To be honest, I have no clue where I want to end up. I’m thinking 130, but maybe I’ll get there and want to go more? I thought I would stop around 140, but here we are. 

Here’s the issue: as we are changing seasons, I have very little to wear. I’ve been wearing sweaters that still fit because they are more relaxed. I have one pair of slacks to wear to work that are too big around the waist. The two pairs of jeans I wear to work routinely sag and make my butt look awful. I’ve been dealing with my leggings slipping down while I jog for months. 

I keep telling myself that I’ll buy new clothes when I reach my goal weight. I set out with the intention of losing 5 pounds in March to get it over with for once and for all, but I can’t do it. The bulk of my loss happened in the first six months, then it slowed—as it does for everyone—as I got smaller. The last few months, I’ve been pretty casual at eating at a deficit and doing my daily activity, and I’ve been gradually losing. 

As I’ve tried ramping up my loss these last few weeks, I just can’t seem to do it. I have had some personal things happen that have been taking up too much mental real estate to to do the really hard deficit required to get through this in a short time frame. 

I’m in my first “professional” job, and I didn’t have a ton to wear before this, but now as the weather is heating up, I really don’t know what to wear. Not to mention, I don’t have any shorts that don’t look ridiculous for the weekends. 

I’m hesitant to buy clothes that will also be kind of ill-fitting if I do lose 5-10 pounds. While my husband and I make a decent amount of money, we are in the market for our first home and we’ve been squirreling away as much money as we can, so I feel like I don’t have a bunch of money to drop on any clothes that may need to be replaced in four months, but I want to look and feel nice at the same time.

Here I am a year and a half later, back up to 240.4 as of yesterday morning. 
I have a ton of mental obstacles so I'm going to do my best to mention them all here, so that I can address all of them.

1) TikTok and body positivity. I am inundated with plus size women looking amazing, and when I see them, I think ""well if they look hot fat, maybe I do too!"" (Spoiler alert, I don't.) 
2) 
My cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose are all within the normal ranges. So when I think about losing weight, I tell myself ""WeLl I'm NoT tHaT uNhEaLtHy"" even though logically, I know those are definitely not the only measures of health. Same with seeing other people's posts with starting weights much higher than mine. I tell myself that I could be much heavier, which, while true, is not a high bar to set for myself.. 
3) I'm incredibly good at justifying things to myself. I always say ""well one X won't hurt"". I'm huge on the ""I can start for real tomorrow"".
4) I have an incredibly unhealthy relationship with food and I need to address this one the most. I look forward to food. I enjoy it. I get excited when I know I'm going out to eat, and I look up the menu in advance and get excited about what I'm going to get. Eating brings me a lot of happiness, and due to me being pretty fucking depressed often, I eat constantly because its one thing that consistently makes me happy. More than once, I've lied to my husband about wether or not I've had dinner, etc, because I know if I say I haven't eaten, I'll get to eat again.

I'm a 42yo 5'11""M SW400/ CW 292/ GW 200. A while back, I decided to get bariatric surgery and did a lot of work with a clinic. After some really good results, I made the decision to just continue on with my program without surgery. This has been very successful, even though it's been very difficult. I was doing appointments with a dietician and bariatric nurse each every month, so everything I'm doing has gone past them. At first, I wanted to mimic the diet I would have if I had actually gotten the surgery, so I went to 1000 calories per day. The professionals said there is no set minimum for the number of calories I need per day, they were just insistent that I get enough protein, take a multivitamin, and have two servings of vegetables per day. They were concerned the calorie restriction would be too much mentally, but I've kept it up for about six months now. I was having a hard time getting enough protein, so I upped my limit to 1200, but with fairly lean sources, I usually still come in at around 1000 anyway. If I feel like treating myself, I eat an Atkins candy bar. (They're really good.)

I don't do cheat days, but I do have special meals that still fit within my limits. Yesterday I had a Popeye's breast and wing with a side of mashed potatoes. Here's the part I need help with. Because I had a rare occurrence of a good night's sleep (23-month old toddler), I decided to do [this hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/koko-head-crater-trail?u=i) that I'd really been looking forward to for a long time. I've done it at 375, 365, and 350, so I knew I could do it at this weight. When I went from 365 to 350, my time went from 52 minutes to 37, so I was really stoked to set a new record. I was moving really fast until it got to the really steep part where I started to get lightheaded. That's never happened to me before. I'm a very experienced hiker, all of that has been at much higher weights than I am now. I also have been doing hill walks anywhere form 30 minutes to over two hours. I know I wasn't dehydrated, so the only thing I can figure is that I just didn't eat enough. 

I really love working out. I'm not really trying to use it as a weight loss tool, I'm just trying to maintain muscle and make sure that I'm ready to do some activities I haven't been able to do with all this weight. I'd like to run once a week or so and do lots more hikes. The question is, should I increase my calorie intake? Should I add carbs in on workout days? Can I get enough energy from just fat? I'm generally happy with my progress, but I'm really hoping to keep this same momentum. I know my weight loss has been rapid (my starting weight was only 9 months ago), but I really want to stay on track. The months go by fast but the days drag on forever.

I am pretty satisfied with the results after approximately  3 months. My arms and my chest look nice.

However, I am struggling with belly fat. I did lose some weight but apparently not enough.

I am not particularly eating healthy but I completely stopped consuming junk food, chocolates and coffee.

Hey everyone!  I’m currently trying to hone my workout plan a bit.  For 8 weeks now I’ve been doing the Push Pull Legs workout 6 days a week without a hitch.  I added a few accessory lifts to each day and MonWedFri I added a 10 minute ab workout to the end of each workout.  So far it’s been good, but I’ve noticed I’ve actually put on about 15 pounds, and while muscle is a lot of that, I do have a high body fat percentage.  I’ve definitely changed my dieting to include more protein and not eat as much “crap” but I’m still seeing a gain in my stomach and I want to cut that down for sure.  I’m in the military and with no PT (thanks Covid) and wasting too much quarantine time I definitely let myself go a bit.  My wife and I broke down and bought a home gym with all the fixin’s so being able to workout at home has been a huge plus.

What I’m curious about is adding running as a way of cutting the fat while continuing some sort of lifting plan, not to mention its 1/3rd of the PT tests.  I’ve thought about doing morning runs on the 1.7 mile running trail loop in our neighborhood, or doing a SunTueThu Lifting - MonWedFri Running situation.  Just curious your take or anyone else experiencing a similar question.  I’m also wanting to add in more focus on push-ups, Situps, planking as well so come PT test time (July) I’ll knock it out of the park.

I am not a fitness newbie. I made a deal with the devil in 2015, putting my career ahead of my health and put on 15lbs and lost a lot of shape.

I'm still in recovery and can't put any load on my arm until April when I start PT. 

Since January 1st, I've been 20:4 IF 5 days a week. I don't eat till I get home from work and then a 4-hour window. No alcohol since new year’s. Three dinners a week are from a meal service and less than 800kcal a meal. I cut 95% of the junk food out of my daily intake. I may have a couple of corn chips just to satisfy a 'crunch' sensation.

It is just horribly maddening to get on the scale on Mondays and see that number bounce over the weekend like that. I feel like I'm physically and mentally playing catch up the rest of the week.

,loseit,"Hello everyone :)

I guess I'm just here to rant about losing my motivation... and hoping some of you might help me gain it back.

In November and December, I lost 20 pounds and went from 165 (75 kg) to 145 (65 kg) (I'm F27, 5'7). Between holidays, birthdays etc. I've completely lost my motivation to follow the CICO diet. 

Initially, I was following the 4000 kj/day, and decided to give myself some slack with the 5000 kj/day, but I wasn't losing weight anymore. I guess that's where my motivation vaned, because I was restricting myself a lot still and it didn't work, so now I reversed back to my old habits of eating whenever and whatever. I haven't gained back any weight, as luck would have it, but I still have 5kg/10 pounds to go to and I can't seem to overcome my food impulses. 

I think, one of the problem is I like how I look now, and though I know I would look better with less weight, vanity was one of my main motivation at the beginning of the diet. 

I wanted to exercise to sculpt my body but gyms are closed right now, and I work best on machines.

,loseit,"In August 2018, at only 4foot 7inches, I was 86kgs, prediabetic and the unhealthiest I’d been in my life. I decided I needed to make a change. At first I didn’t start with anything too dramatic. I reduced my food portions, ate less simple carbohydrates and exercised three to four times a week. At this point I was quite unfit and couldn’t do all that much in the way of exercise, but whenever I went to the gym I made sure that whatever I did, I would get my heart rate up and I’d make sure I was sweaty before I left. 

By August 2019, I had gotten down to 75kgs. Although it had taken me a year, I was so proud of what I had achieved and at that point, it was the healthiest and happiest I’d felt in my life. 

Throughout 2019 I continued with the healthier eating but became more stringent and focused on watching what I was eating and by this point could do a lot more fitness wise. I would run on the treadmill, go on long hikes, do lots of strength training. I tried lots of different things and found I enjoyed it all now that I was fitter. 

However in August of 2020 I’d plateaued at 66kgs. I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong. I never took a day off. I exercised every day for over two years and nothing worked. 

My GP suggested I try the Fast 800 program by Dr Michael Mosley. With this I would eat 800 calories a day within a 12 hour period. I did this from October to December and continued with my exercise but still I stayed at 66kgs. 

I feel like I’ve had every blood test done under the sun and nothing abnormal shows up. I’ve been to an endocrinologist. They can’t figure out why I’m not losing weight. I’ve looked a bit at theories around different body types and how if you’re an endomorph (which is how I would describe my body type) this can effect the way you lose weight.

I decided I needed to make a change. At first I didn’t start with anything too dramatic. I reduced my food portions, ate less simple carbohydrates and exercised three to four times a week. At this point I was quite unfit and couldn’t do all that much in the way of exercise, but whenever I went to the gym I made sure that whatever I did, I would get my heart rate up and I’d make sure I was sweaty before I left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By August 2019, I had gotten down to 75kgs. Although it had taken me a year, I was so proud of what I had achieved and at that point, it was the healthiest and happiest I’d felt in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2019 I continued with the healthier eating but became more stringent and focused on watching what I was eating and by this point could do a lot more fitness wise. I would run on the treadmill, go on long hikes, do lots of strength training. I tried lots of different things and found I enjoyed it all now that I was fitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in August of 2020 I’d plateaued at 66kgs. I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong. I never took a day off. I exercised every day for over two years and nothing worked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My GP suggested I try the Fast 800 program by Dr Michael Mosley. With this I would eat 800 calories a day within a 12 hour period. I did this from October to December and continued with my exercise but still I stayed at 66kgs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I’ve had every blood test done under the sun and nothing abnormal shows up. I’ve been to an endocrinologist. They can’t figure out why I’m not losing weight. I’ve looked a bit at theories around different body types and how if you’re an endomorph (which is how I would describe my body type) this can effect the way you lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say I’m at my wits end is an understatement. I can’t continue to maintain the momentum of reduced calories and strict exercise regime for my entire life. Especially when it’s no longer resulting in weight loss.

So I don’t know if this will really help anyone, but I had a bit of a moment today that I thought I would share.

I’ve lost and regained hundreds and hundreds of pounds over the decades, but this most recent time I really took a different approach.  I decided that I would stick to it come hell or high water.  I would read everything I came across, and I would try every strategy.  So I did.  If I came across a motivational tool, I did it even if I thought it sounded dumb.  I had sticker charts (that didn’t last long), rewards written down for milestones (I owe myself SO MANY rewards), the two jars of marbles (I like that one better than I thought I would), progress pictures, everything.  You name it, I gave it a try.  Some I enjoyed more than I thought I would, some I stopped doing.

Well, I had forgotten that I made a “dream board.”  That’s not really my thing, but I had promised myself to try everything.  I made it as a private board on Pinterest, and it has pictures of all of the things that I could think of that were my motivations when I first started.  I did look at it a bit when I was struggling at first, but then as I got better coping skills, I stopped looking at it and forgot about it completely.

Today I came across it.  Looking through it, I have either archived or am able to achieve almost everything on it.  There are some things I haven’t actually done, but my weight is no longer a barrier to doing it.  For example, I really want to go sky diving.  Well now it’s just a matter of going out and doing it, instead of it being something I physically couldn’t do.  

If I’m being honest, when I made that board, I don’t know that I really thought I would do those things.  But being able to look back and see the things I wanted SO BAD and know that they’re within my grasp is a pretty amazing feeling.

&lt;p&gt;So I don’t know if this will really help anyone, but I had a bit of a moment today that I thought I would share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve lost and regained hundreds and hundreds of pounds over the decades, but this most recent time I really took a different approach.  I decided that I would stick to it come hell or high water.  I would read everything I came across, and I would try every strategy.  So I did.  If I came across a motivational tool, I did it even if I thought it sounded dumb.  I had sticker charts (that didn’t last long), rewards written down for milestones (I owe myself SO MANY rewards), the two jars of marbles (I like that one better than I thought I would), progress pictures, everything.  You name it, I gave it a try.  Some I enjoyed more than I thought I would, some I stopped doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I had forgotten that I made a “dream board.”  That’s not really my thing, but I had promised myself to try everything.  I made it as a private board on Pinterest, and it has pictures of all of the things that I could think of that were my motivations when I first started.  I did look at it a bit when I was struggling at first, but then as I got better coping skills, I stopped looking at it and forgot about it completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I came across it.  Looking through it, I have either archived or am able to achieve almost everything on it.  There are some things I haven’t actually done, but my weight is no longer a barrier to doing it.  For example, I really want to go sky diving.  Well now it’s just a matter of going out and doing it, instead of it being something I physically couldn’t do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’m being honest, when I made that board, I don’t know that I really thought I would do those things.  But being able to look back and see the things I wanted SO BAD and know that they’re within my grasp is a pretty amazing feeling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the moral of my story is to try things that you think won’t help.  You might be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"Hey there wonderful people

Yesterday I decided for the 10th time since the beginning of the pandemic to get back on CICO. A bit of background: I'm a 46 year old dad of a 6 y.o. kid, and I've been overweight since my early teens, and obese since the early 20s. I found this sub on 2016 or so, and on late 2017 I decided to give CICO and C25K a shot, and managed to go down from 125kg to 106kg in 18 months, slow and steady. Joined a ton of 5k and 10k races and even a half marathon in August 2019 in which I finished nearly last, but I finished it. In late 2019 I started to fall off the wagon a bit but I was certain I'd get back on track in early 2020, and then covid showed up.

Fast forward to now and I'm pretty much back to square zero. I'm not sure about my weight as I'm afraid to check, but I'm sure it's over 120kg.

Looking my self at the mirror last Friday night I decided to get serious again about calorie tracking. And then today my mother in-law (we're in the isolation bubble with my in-laws to get support while my wife and I work from home) who usually cooks or orders the most tempting food decided to cook my favorite dessert, a typical Brazilian dessert (pudim de leite). It was tough to see that thing tempting me all day.

My main strategy was to pick up a book I've read in 2017, Amy Johnson's ""The little book of Big change"", and remind me that an urge is just a thought, not an order or a reason to try to ""out think"" it. It's an habitual thought which is best when it's simply discarded as new thoughts will come, our brain is a constant, random thought generator. It seemed to have helped.

Anyway this post turned out to be a long rambling. In any case here's for day 2 of my journey, I hope I have the strength to stick to it.

,loseit,"I probably gained close to 30 pounds over the year due to pandemic, major stress and depression. I joined a YMCA a week ago and it has a lap pool I want to use. I put on a bathing suit for the first time in over a year a few days ago and I was disgusted at myself. I’m scared to go out in public and people seeing me in it.

I'm having some issues with plateauting and I could really use some advice.

Some context, I started this journey back to being more active and healthier at the middle of this entire global situation, where I moved back home for a bit. I started off at 5'8, 210, never really looking too overweight (I think it's because I have super thick muscular thighs and calves without ever doing leg days) but I wanted to get back to a healthier BMI and body fat %. 

Since September, I'm sitting around 188 (hasn't dropped past 187)  through a combined effort of daily 2 mile walks and just eating cleaner and healthier. I also suspect not drinking much at all contributed as well.

Over the past month, I've had debilitating sciatica and haven't been able to move much, much less go on walks. The kettlebell and dumbbells I purchased have just been sitting in my room because my leg pain is way too much for me to handle right now.

&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, I&amp;#39;ve had debilitating sciatica and haven&amp;#39;t been able to move much, much less go on walks. The kettlebell and dumbbells I purchased have just been sitting in my room because my leg pain is way too much for me to handle right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, my weight hasn&amp;#39;t shot up and just stayed consistent but does anyone know any other ways that I can push past this plateau even without the ability to be too active right now? Is the only thing I can do cutting calories?&lt;/p&gt;

Hi everyone! First time making a post here, but I've been lurking for quite some time. Around the early part of 2018 I got out of a long relationship and was at my heaviest weight of 265. 

I committed to losing weight that summer and was able to lose about 70 pounds doing IF 16:8 \~1500-1800 calories a day and getting into the gym 5 days a week doing cardio on an elliptical and lifting weights for about a half hour. I hadn't really had much experience in a gym so for my lifting I would alternate between upper body/ lower body and do 4 sets of 8 on 5 different machines/ exercises. 

After the summer I went back to school and stopped working out and watching what I ate and subsequently gained back 10-15 pounds. The next summer came and I once again committed to getting back into the gym and losing some more weight. Although I did manage to lose the weight I gained, my eating habits were all over the place and I stayed around 195-200 pounds. 

Fast forward to March 2020 and COVID hits. I move back in with my parents to save some money and pick up running because gyms are all closed and I have unlimited free time essentially. I ran my first 10k in July and then my first half-marathon in September!! This time around I'm not doing any lifting though. At this point I'm steadily losing weight from running and IF 16:8 and managed to get down to around 170 pounds. Then about a month after my half-marathon I pulled a muscle and was off for a few months, subsequently gaining back 15 pounds. 

I picked up running again in December, and now am at the point where I'm lifting 5 days a week and running 25 miles a week. I still would like to lose some more weight, and get somewhere between 160-165. Once I get there I can switch my focus to lifting more, eating in a surplus, and putting on some muscle! 

The biggest thing I've learned throughout all of this is that weight loss is not always a linear progression. There are lots of bumps in the road, but the most important thing is that you pick yourself up and get back on the wagon! My quality of life has improved so much. I can do everyday activities without getting tired! Also, at least for me, obsessing over calories has never worked. I never know exactly how many I'm consuming, but I have a good estimate in my head.

&lt;p&gt;I picked up running again in December, and now am at the point where I&amp;#39;m lifting 5 days a week and running 25 miles a week. I still would like to lose some more weight, and get somewhere between 160-165. Once I get there I can switch my focus to lifting more, eating in a surplus, and putting on some muscle! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I&amp;#39;ve learned throughout all of this is that weight loss is not always a linear progression. There are lots of bumps in the road, but the most important thing is that you pick yourself up and get back on the wagon! My quality of life has improved so much. I can do everyday activities without getting tired! Also, at least for me, obsessing over calories has never worked. I never know exactly how many I&amp;#39;m consuming, but I have a good estimate in my head. It just made things easier that way!&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"Hi everyone,

Been a member of this sub for a while, I love reading stories of how far people have come on their weight loss journeys, every time I read them I think I really need to try, but after a few days I lose the motivation.

I’m 26 about 5”9 weighing in at 330lbs. I know, it’s really not good. I’ve struggled with my weight my entire life, in school I topped 16st but managed to lose it by basically hardly ever eating and exercising a lot, my motivation at the time was I was fed up of being bullied. 

This is the biggest I have ever been, and I know it’s only a small amount of time now before I end up with a serious health condition (diabetes) because of it. 
A few years ago I tried keto, and was doing really well and then got pregnant, I had heard that losing weight during pregnancy wasn’t good so I went back on carbs. I still ended up losing weight during pregnancy, bad morning sickness. 
Once I had my little girl in May 2019 I’ve just piled on the lbs, then all these lockdowns too I’ve been working from home and hardly exercising at all. 

I cannot stand the way I look now, and I know that even once I’ve lost all the weight I will have so much excess skin. I’m scared of how big I am, and scared of how gross I’ll still look when all the weight is gone. 

I need to do this, I kept promising I would when I had my baby, and I just never properly tried. I don’t want her to ever end up like me, or even motherless when I eat myself into an early grave.
My size has been impacting my relationship for years, my partner is loyal and loving he would never intentionally upset me, but I know he is so worried for me. To try and motivate me to lose weight he said I need to get down to 17st before we can start trying again, I was annoyed at first, but I get why, he knows how much I want a big family and that it should motivate me to lose weight. It did at first, but then again I just stopped. I have no excuses really, I’m ashamed of myself, when I really think about it I often cry so I guess I try to just push it out of my mind.

The one thing I find weird is keeping when to count calories burned, you see as a small gig I clean houses and other areas, this is now a ""gig"" cause I work ONLY for 2 costumers, a gay couple who are very lovely and make you feel welcomed when cleaning. I clean both their house and their store which is a spa.

Usually it's a 3 person job for both of the places but we've had up to 5 people cleaning to shorten time, the thing is we usually only clean in 1 day either their house OR spa, rarely do we do both at the same time, so when we did both yesterday we obviously needed food, we went to mcdonalds and we loaded up with lunch, in the morning I already had a big breakfast, a 1000 calorie breakfast and it lasted me enough energy throughout the cleaning of the house but when we got to the spa at around 7 we NEEDED food, I got a small mcdonalds ice cream, a big Mac and fries, I know that FOR SURE is somewhere in the 1000-2000 calorie count but ya know, things HAPPEN. I didn't worry much knowing I could just cico those calories later on, a small bump on the long road.

But the question is SHOULD I count the calories burned during the cleaning?

&lt;p&gt;Usually it&amp;#39;s a 3 person job for both of the places but we&amp;#39;ve had up to 5 people cleaning to shorten time, the thing is we usually only clean in 1 day either their house OR spa, rarely do we do both at the same time, so when we did both yesterday we obviously needed food, we went to mcdonalds and we loaded up with lunch, in the morning I already had a big breakfast, a 1000 calorie breakfast and it lasted me enough energy throughout the cleaning of the house but when we got to the spa at around 7 we NEEDED food, I got a small mcdonalds ice cream, a big Mac and fries, I know that FOR SURE is somewhere in the 1000-2000 calorie count but ya know, things HAPPEN. I didn&amp;#39;t worry much knowing I could just cico those calories later on, a small bump on the long road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the question is SHOULD I count the calories burned during the cleaning? As you heard I had practically burnt dry the 1000 calories by the end of the first part so SHOULD  I add it into count next time? And how would i?&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"**Today is your Day 1?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to** r/Loseit!

&amp;#x200B;

So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why you’re overweight

&amp;#x200B;

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before You Start

&amp;#x200B;

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tracking

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

&amp;#x200B;

# Creating Your Deficit

&amp;#x200B;

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Exercise

&amp;#x200B;

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Crawl, Walk, Run

&amp;#x200B;

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Acceptance

&amp;#x200B;

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.

&lt;p&gt;We all want instant results, especially when it comes to weight loss, but the journey really is important to the course. I’m just a little over half way to my goal and this is validation to me that this process is meant to take time. We have to build and strengthen habits that make our weight loss goals achievable and maintainable. Losing weight is so much more than a physical change, and I’m loving this person I’m becoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers to better health, better habits and this wonderful community!&lt;/p&gt;

Stay within calorie range (1800): Partner's birthday, maintenance. This first week was a bit of a wash on this front. 2/2 days.

Exercise 5 days a week: Gentle walk along a scenic over view path. Would like to have gone longer but it was sunshiny &amp; lovely. 7/7 days.

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, nonfood rewards): Started a really interesting book called ""The Only Good Indians"". Also finished another book this week. Keeps the wheels of my brain turning on productive things.

Try a new recipe once a week: Roasted romanesco &amp; sausage sammiches with grilled veggies. New sausage cooking method &amp; new types of sautéed veggies, new cooking method &amp; sammich, I say it counts! 2/4 weeks.

Express mindfulness and or gratitude: Today I’m grateful for perspective. Introspection is the name of the game, especially in quarentimes. I have a lot to learn as a person. I am experiencing metaphorical growing pains associated with becoming a person that welcomes love &amp; human connection instead of choosing to hide from it.

As you may have seen by the title, I wanna lose 80 pounds by the end of the year, as I’m currently a few pounds below 250 and have been overweight for years. I’ve always wanted to lose weight, but every time I’ve tried it never worked out for me and I just gained the weight I lost right back and then some. I started working out again at the beginning of the year, and have started to decrease the amount I eat everyday. I’m trying to eat below 1300 kcal daily, and I think me working out will help as well. However, I know there’s so much more that goes into losing weight, and I’m wondering if y’all have any advice in terms of what else I can do. Thanks to those who answer.&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"So the title says most of it anyway.  I'm a big loser like many people here  and about to get a tummy tuck/abdominoplasty.  I've done a lot of legwork with the process and wanted to share some of the pitfalls and successes I've had in terms of planning the surgery, finding a surgeon, costs/paying for surgery, and even how to determine if you should have the surgery (IMHO).

As a precursor, **know that you're actually ready.**  Are you at your goal weight or a healthy weight?  Has your weight been stable (i.e. 1-2 years min)?  Do you know what it is you want to accomplish with a tummy tuck?  Is what you're seeing actually loose skin or simply excess fat?  Does what you see bother you enough you'd want to undergo surgery to correct it? 

If you're still obese and considering getting the tummy tuck, please keep going until you reach a normal BMI.  You owe it to yourself and a tummy tuck is not going to reveal a magical body underneath.  IMO if you've lost enough weight to have loose skin, you 100% have the capacity to get to a truly healthy weight.  If you still find yourself binging or emotional eating despite being at a healthy weight - this was huge for me - you also need to ask yourself if it's the right time.  If your weight loss was less dramatic, is what you're seeing really loose skin?  A tummy tuck scar can be 8"" or around your hips.  Is it worth going under the knife for that?

So after that disclaimer, tips for surgery...

1. **Shop surgeons.**  I ended up getting 4 consults and paid $300 - $150 of which was non-refundable.  Absolutely glad I did it.  You pay a consult fee and it's applied to the surgery if you go with that surgeon; if not, you lose it.  Seeing 4 doctors let me know whose prices were in line and whose weren't - I'll get more to that soon.  Seeing 4 doctors also let know which tummy tuck to decide on (e.g. mini, standard, extended, body lift/belt lipectomy).  It's never bad to have a second opinion, if only to confirm.  And one of the doctors I was appalled by so...
2. **Plan.**  Taking medical leave through work, applying for Short Term Disability (if applicable), arranging for a caretaker, medical followups - all take a lot of time.  Your back-to-work time might be anywhere from 2-8 weeks depending on your procedure.  If you're only getting loose skin removed (panniculectomy) with liposuction (included in the procedure cost), you're looking at a few weeks recovery - this is for all the big losers.  If you're getting abdominal muscle repair, you'll be out much longer - this is primarily women from childbirth.  You'll need a caretaker for your first week or two.  Meal prep is a good thing.  
3. **Consider all the costs and how you'll pay.**  I'm in the U.S. and my procedure is being performed domestically.  My 4 quotes in a major Northeastern city as of late 2020 average slightly under $11k for abdominoplasty without muscle repair in a surgical center.  Doctors' offices will frequently give you the option of having the procedure in a surgery center or a hospital.  Regardless of the decision, the procedure is outpatient and lasts about 3-4 hours.  A surgery center will cost anywhere from $1k-$2k less than the hospital. Abdominoplasty with muscle repair will cost more.  Insurance will not cover your procedure.  You realistically cannot obtain pre-authorization before your surgery either, unless you want to fight for it years ahead of time.  Insurance will only cover panniculectomies (loose skin removal) in cases of EXTREME weight loss that include skin irritations leading to chronic infection.  Quality of life considerations do not come into play.  Most plastic surgeon's offices are not set up for medical insurance billing and will tell you upfront they will help you with whatever documentation you'll need, but that the fight is yours.   


The  biggest expense besides the surgery is lost pay.  I'm fortunate in that my Short Term Disability policy covers all elective surgeries.  Most seem like they don't, but it doesn't hurt to inquire.  STD pays a fraction of your average wage after you've been out of work for a certain amount of days (the benefit doesn't start immediately).  

**I hope this next part helps people, because it's shaved thousands of dollars off my total costs had I not done otherwise.  (I didn't invent capitalism.)**

I recognize that this piece won't help everyone.  The surgery itself is obviously a stretch purchase for the vast majority of folks.  Here's what I'd recommend if your situation is similar to mine.

I saved for the entire procedure (including lost pay) and was going to pay in cash, but I'm paying with credit cards instead.  If you have good credit and can afford the surgery outright, consider doing the same.  Don't get 0% financing or financing through the doctor's office.  This has helped me shave about $3k from my total bill.  

Credit card sign up offers are golden.  You might get an offer that reads, ""Spend $1,000 in the first month, get $200 cashback!"" or something similar.  They're all the same; spend money X in 90 days and get reward Y.

I put all of my regular expenses on credit cards anyway - easier to track, I get rewards, better purchase protection.  I spend $2k a month on average.  But to be clear, I pay everything in full each month, so I carry no balance.  So if you're planning a $11k surgery and have credit card expenses of $2k per month like me, you're looking at $17k in 90 days.  How many credit cards can I sign up for then?  I got 6 with an 800 credit score, but in theory anything about 750 should be fine.  With all my bonus offers, minus a few with annual fees, I netted a little under $2,000.  

Running multiple credit cards is going to result in multiple hard inquiries.  This typically hurts people's credit.  I did NOT hurt mine.  This is why:

Credit score formulas are complicated and opaque, but basically you're judged off of different metrics with different degrees of importance.  Paying on time is by far number one with something like number of accounts coming in last.  Another key aspect is your utilization ratio.  Basically, the less of your available credit you use (outstanding amounts/all credit card spending limits), the better your score.  Even with 6 hard inquiries on my credit, my score did not go down.  The credit limits on my new cards caused my utilization to plummet, offsetting the dip from the inquiries (evidently).  YMMV.  

I did all the applications online in rapid fire and got instant approvals.  This part helps A LOT.  I link all my bills through PayPal.  Pay for your recurring bills through PayPal and set up a new card as the default.  Pay for all your physical purchases on this card until you hit the minimum spend amount and then pay off the card entirely.  Repeat this process for the next card and the next until your surgery.  Once your surgery fees are due - typically two weeks prior to surgery - ask the surgeon to split the cost among your remaining cards that still need to hit the minimum to receive the bonus.  With proper planning and financials, you shouldn't have to pay a dime in interest.

For me, STD benefits are direct deposit and eligible for new account bonuses in the same way credit cards are, ""Make X amount in direct deposits in 90 days and receive reward Y!"".  The online portal that administers my benefits is insanely easy with direct deposit, I can actually set up multiple accounts with defined contributions per week.  So I opened up 5 checking accounts with a $200 average bonus for $500 direct deposits in 90 days (or $2,500 in 90 days for all 5 total).  $100 per week from STD benefits into each account will cover me after 5 weeks, for an additional bonus of $1,000.  

Total ""savings"" of $3k.  The pitfalls to watch out for are making sure you aren't paying monthly fees on the checking accounts or annual fees on the credit cards.  Also, pay your entire statement off.  If you were gonna pay upfront, you already have the money.  

Tangent:  I've learned a lot about credit cards and checking accounts too.  They're definitely not all created equal.  If you find a financial product you like, stick with it and don't just cancel once you've gotten your intro bonus.  Similarly, don't hold onto a bad product; you tried it and it didn't work out.  Don't feel bad, it's competition among banks looking for your money.

Hello! I just wanted to share my experience to see if it might be helpful to anyone here! I've always had a hard time convincing myself to stay on diet or exercise plans because even as I put on 40 extra pounds, with my height and build it hides itself pretty well. I was feeling the extra pounds though, and I've wanted to get back to where I was before my poor food choices in college got me where I have been the last few years. 

It was a cycle I'm sure we're all familiar with, start, go strong, get distracted or discouraged and lose all the progress. Then do it again a in month or so.

But recently I decided to start over, and I decided to take it one thing at a time. Start with only a focus on calories in vs out and make sure I'm staying in a deficit. So here's where the mind game started. 

Last time I tried, I set a small deficit goal and I had a hard time keeping it. I would either severely undershoot it and starve and then I would bounce back and overshoot the next day and so I wasn't making any sort of consistent progress and I gave up before too long. 

But this time, I outsmarted myself. I set a deficit goal of 1000 calories a day, which is massive for me, knowing it would be tough to keep, but setting such an intense goal for myself allows me to push myself towards that big goal, but even if I miss it or have a day that I feel like I need more, I still wind up with an average of 300-500 deficit a day, sometimes more. It lets the part of my brain who wants to get away with eating more than my goal get what it wants, while letting the rational part of my brain still accept that progress is being made because I'm still in deficit and losing weight. 

It works for me because it includes my tendency to cheat on my diet into my plans and ""outsmarts"" myself.

&lt;p&gt;Hello! I just wanted to share my experience to see if it might be helpful to anyone here! I&amp;#39;ve always had a hard time convincing myself to stay on diet or exercise plans because even as I put on 40 extra pounds, with my height and build it hides itself pretty well. I was feeling the extra pounds though, and I&amp;#39;ve wanted to get back to where I was before my poor food choices in college got me where I have been the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a cycle I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;re all familiar with, start, go strong, get distracted or discouraged and lose all the progress. Then do it again a in month or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But recently I decided to start over, and I decided to take it one thing at a time. Start with only a focus on calories in vs out and make sure I&amp;#39;m staying in a deficit. So here&amp;#39;s where the mind game started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I tried, I set a small deficit goal and I had a hard time keeping it. I would either severely undershoot it and starve and then I would bounce back and overshoot the next day and so I wasn&amp;#39;t making any sort of consistent progress and I gave up before too long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time, I outsmarted myself. I set a deficit goal of 1000 calories a day, which is massive for me, knowing it would be tough to keep, but setting such an intense goal for myself allows me to push myself towards that big goal, but even if I miss it or have a day that I feel like I need more, I still wind up with an average of 300-500 deficit a day, sometimes more. It lets the part of my brain who wants to get away with eating more than my goal get what it wants, while letting the rational part of my brain still accept that progress is being made because I&amp;#39;m still in deficit and losing weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works for me because it includes my tendency to cheat on my diet into my plans and &amp;quot;outsmarts&amp;quot; myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if that would be helpful for anyone else, but I&amp;#39;ve managed to drop nearly 10 pounds in the last month or so and I&amp;#39;m happy with the progress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep up the good work everyone! Go team!&lt;/p&gt;

I've had only 4 cheat days in the entirety of my ""journey"" so far, on occasions I couldn't avoid eating like NYE, my birthday etc. Cheat days for me were never a regular thing, because I found them distracting and I honestly couldn't trust my self-control since I'm a huge foodie. However since I've reached my first goal weight (70kg/154lbs), I've been considering having a cheat day/meal once in a while to satisfy my cravings. You see I've gotten so far, and now I'm a little bit tired :p 

My life's situation is a little bit physically/mentally draining for me at the moment, and knowing my tendency to emotional eat I want to add some moderate cheat days so my cravings don't pile up and explode one day haha. I have a few questions: 

- How often do you have a cheat day? Is it an entire day or just one meal? 
- People who do IF, do you break your fast on your cheat days?  
- Do you have a caloric limit for your cheat meal/day? Do you go past your maintenance? 
- To fellow binge eaters: How do you control yourself so you don't binge on cheat days? 
- How has having a cheat meal/day been affecting your weight loss journey so far? Is there any noticeable mental/physical effect?

I have been on a weight loss journey since Sept 2020. I have reached my goal weight in December, but I was able to easily gain the weight back little by little.

**Here is my activity level:**

* I work in a desk for 6 hrs a day.
* After work, I take a walk for about 1.5 hrs- trying to at least get 11,000 steps a day. I try to do this everyday except for when there's a bad weather.
* After walk, I always do some kind of resistance training plus HIIT. I do this 5 days out of the week.

I mildly started resistance training about a month ago, but about a week ago, I completely overhauled my workout schedule alternating the days with leg, glutes, upper body.

**My diet:**

I first started with 1200 calories per day then reduced to 1100 a day, and this allowed me to reach 109. When I started to gain more weight, I went back to 1100, but it wasn't sustainable anymore (crazy hunger, and weak performance while working out).

* Now I eat about 1280 calories which is still in a deficit, but I'm gaining weight/fat. My clothes are starting to get tighter especially around my armpit area, but my belly is still on the slim side.
* I try to keep my macros to this ratio: 4 (carbs128g): 3(protein 96g): 3(fat 43g).
* I used to have cheat days once a week, but now I don't even do this anymore.
* I don't eat a lot of processed foods. I eat nuts, yogurt, berries, rice cakes, and two Bouchard dark chocolates as snacks.
* I drink one glass of green tea a day, and at least 2L of water a day.

**My overall goal:**

I'm not just solely looking for my weight to go down. I'm working towards to see more muscle definition, but I have excess fat especially around my upper back and lower belly right under the belly button. I am just so confused as to why I am gaining fat rather than losing... Any advice?

,loseit,"Hi all!

I know that many of you look for motivation so here is a list of reasons, from my personal wins, beyond the scale:

\- So I have a super flat face and I noticed esp in photos it would look so weird. Photos are all about the angles and I had none. Furthermore, my eyelids were thin and crepey, my skin was soft and sagging, and my cheeks looked heavy. Turns out, having enough electrolytes, water and minimal sugar, carbs and dairy, gives your facial skin wayyyyy more bounce. I specify facial skin because it \*is\* very different to body skin. Since my bone structure is so flat, now I'm even more keen to see how it will look once I've lost a fuckton of fat. 

\- My body skin! Listen, I'll be open and honest and say I already started with flawless Asian skin, and being a skincare addict, I have worked on that for yearsssss. Nevertheless, I was delighted to see further improvement, that my pores are tighter, my skin is smoother, the texture is creamier

\- My long-standing interest in skincare was really about chemistry: how does Chemical X result in Improvement Y on your skin? So when I started the health kick, I was mostly interested in the nutrition. I found motivation in the science, which is great cos I wasn't just counting the scales, which honestly hasn't moved much over 1 month. Finding an interest in this has been a win cos 1. it's interesting lol and 2. helps keep me on the wagon 

\- My gut health has improved: ah its kinda gross how I know this, but basically stools lol. Also, I just \*feel\* better in my gut. This is highly important to me because I think the gut is possibly the most important part of my health and I like to keep my microbes happy. 

\- My ass is firmer 

\- I eat for nutrition, not just calories. Calories are absolutely not all the same, and I am still trying to replace my godforsaken packet chips (have reduced tho). Food that has enzymes, nutrients, fatty acids, antioxidants, are going to beat ones that don't 

\- I am making my limited budget go further, with less 

\- My apartment smells nice, because it smells like fresh food

&lt;p&gt;I know that many of you look for motivation so here is a list of reasons, from my personal wins, beyond the scale:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- So I have a super flat face and I noticed esp in photos it would look so weird. Photos are all about the angles and I had none. Furthermore, my eyelids were thin and crepey, my skin was soft and sagging, and my cheeks looked heavy. Turns out, having enough electrolytes, water and minimal sugar, carbs and dairy, gives your facial skin wayyyyy more bounce. I specify facial skin because it *is* very different to body skin. Since my bone structure is so flat, now I&amp;#39;m even more keen to see how it will look once I&amp;#39;ve lost a fuckton of fat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My body skin! Listen, I&amp;#39;ll be open and honest and say I already started with flawless Asian skin, and being a skincare addict, I have worked on that for yearsssss. Nevertheless, I was delighted to see further improvement, that my pores are tighter, my skin is smoother, the texture is creamier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My long-standing interest in skincare was really about chemistry: how does Chemical X result in Improvement Y on your skin? So when I started the health kick, I was mostly interested in the nutrition. I found motivation in the science, which is great cos I wasn&amp;#39;t just counting the scales, which honestly hasn&amp;#39;t moved much over 1 month. Finding an interest in this has been a win cos 1. it&amp;#39;s interesting lol and 2. helps keep me on the wagon &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My gut health has improved: ah its kinda gross how I know this, but basically stools lol. Also, I just *feel* better in my gut. This is highly important to me because I think the gut is possibly the most important part of my health and I like to keep my microbes happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My ass is firmer &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I eat for nutrition, not just calories. Calories are absolutely not all the same, and I am still trying to replace my godforsaken packet chips (have reduced tho). Food that has enzymes, nutrients, fatty acids, antioxidants, are going to beat ones that don&amp;#39;t &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I am making my limited budget go further, with less &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My apartment smells nice, because it smells like fresh food &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I make small, but sustainable, improvements. I post in the Daily Victories thread almost every single day. I like making a change and tracking it&amp;#39;s impact on me, so that I know if it benefits me, which motivates me. And if it doesn&amp;#39;t work for me eg nuts for reasons, then I can go okay now I know. Either way, it allows me to see the real time impact rather than waiting for the scales, and helps prevent fatigue &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-  I balance eating for fuel and pleasure. Fresh fruit and skinny cream are one of the favourite things in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I get value from making better choices for my exercise, diet, and wallet. Knowing that it&amp;#39;s a better decision gives me the immediate feedback that gives me that dopamine hit everyone wants! &lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"Hi everyone! I'm a 26 year old male, measure about 5' 7.5"", and weigh in at 146.4 lbs. 

I've always struggled with my weight. Growing up, i was always chubby. To rectify that, i joined swim teams but didn't see a meaningful change - probably bc of my diet (i love pizza and everything carby). Things changed when i got a personal trainer who introduced me to weight lifting and told me to cut all the crap out.

Fast forward to today, i work a desk job (get like 5-6hrs/night of sleep on avg) and have quite a sedentary lifestyle. The only exercise i get is through the few times i go to the gym. Before the start of the year i didn't really track calories or watch my macros.

I've recently decided that it's the perfect time for me to ""lean"" up bc of COVID and all the time home. Also, my friends want to do a week trip to Hawaii, which is the main impetus for my recent drive. I've been counting my calories and actively trying to increase my protein intake. I avg about 90-100g of protein, 160-200g of carbs, and 15-20g of fat. Calorie goal of ~1,700 calculated by MyFitnessPal. I'm vegetarian (no meat, no fish, no egg) by religion so protein intake is always a challenge and my diet skews heavier to carbs (legumes, fruits, like everything else).

Despite my efforts (both now and historically), I'd say my body look is more like skinny fat. All my fat is stored in my gut (and some back fat); my legs are very lean looking. Not sure if it's because of a weak core but my stomach is ALWAYS hanging out. I only ""look"" skinny/fit when i flex my core and my stomach sort of pulls in. I'd say there is some noticable muscle definition in the arms area. Can't see my abs or anything really. I tell my friends i need to lose weight and they look at me like I'm crazy.

I've used those body scales that tell you your body fat %. Research seems to indicate they're not accurate at all? They usually give me a range of 16%-17%. Using the ""eye test"", I'd say 20% bc of my gut area sticking out but i know I should be somewhere in between there, give how skinny i look elsewhere (at least to me). 

My goal is to get leaner/burn this fat off while hopefully building some muscle definition (hopefully by the summer or at least make meaningful progress), but I'm not sure how to do that. It's like a dream of mine to have that summer beach body (if i flex my core i can for sure feel the muscle definition underneath; it's just buried under the top layer of fat). I lift chest/shoulder/bicep when i go. I know i should have a balance and do triceps/back/legs/abs. I'm wondering if any of you have any advice for me? I'm not sure if i need to be lifting more often, more variety in terms of body parts I'm hitting, more weight/stress on the body, incorporate cardio? (Which is non existent right now), cut even more calories?, Etc.

,loseit,"So at the height of depression and such (had moved to a new state for a new job, hadn't seen my family in three months since needed to have a house first) I managed to eat my way to 327 pounds. Heaviest I've ever been in my life. Decided it was time to change, started doing intermittent fasting and keto (and actually COOKING). Have coupled that with walking at a brisk pace (fast enough to be movin', slow enough that I can carry a conversation). That's it. This morning, I'm down sixty pounds, to 267. It's a good feeling, not going to lie. Smaller numbers feel great in this game. The thing that REALLY got me feeling good was on Friday.

Heaviest I&amp;#39;ve ever been in my life. Decided it was time to change, started doing intermittent fasting and keto (and actually COOKING). Have coupled that with walking at a brisk pace (fast enough to be movin&amp;#39;, slow enough that I can carry a conversation). That&amp;#39;s it. This morning, I&amp;#39;m down sixty pounds, to 267. It&amp;#39;s a good feeling, not going to lie. Smaller numbers feel great in this game. The thing that REALLY got me feeling good was on Friday.

I am a 5'7"" female who has always struggled with weight. For reference, I was 5'3"" and weighed 135 lbs when I was 10. In high school I held the same weight all throughout, at roughly 185 lbs. I've gained a lot of weight over the pandemic and I'm at my wit's end trying to lose it. 

My biggest limiting factor with dieting is that I have Celiac disease, so I have to be 100 percent gluten free. I've been doing some workout videos at home, and my usual go-tos are dance workouts and low-impact cardio because I don't have any equipment or a gym membership. I lost about 15 lbs when I first went gluten free 2 years ago, but I've gained it all back and then some in the past 18 months. 

I don't want to do any fad diets. I tried intermittent fasting for a few weeks and hated it because I felt so obsessive over clocking my eating time that it really overtook my life. (I also didn't feel like I saw any results from it--I felt worse, not better.) I'm also not down for spending a lot of money on supplements, sugar replacements, or expensive luxury items like coconut aminos.

,loseit,"hi! so i‘m a 20 year old girl and ever since i got into middle school i wanted to look like a stereotypical supermodel (silly, i know). 
i went to a school that focused on dance, ballet in particular, and as any of you who did ballet will know that the bullying and toxicity in that environment is brutal. 
i used to constantly get bullied and excluded for being weird and fat (even though i was never more than 5kg overweight) so because of that and some other messed up reasons i naturally developed an ed and have been struggling with that over the past eight years. 
i went vegan for ethical reasons at 16 which made me lose those 5 extra kilos and ever since then i‘ve been losing and gaining the same 3-4kg in the healthy weight range but it’s never been substantial. 

after years of therapy and learning to love myself it somehow clicked this year. i don’t look at myself in the mirror with disgust anymore, i don’t hate my body, i don’t see food as a reward or punishment anymore and exercise is something that just makes sense for some reason.
i’m now at the lowest weight i’ve ever been with my height (181cm/73kg) and i just keep on losing. i feel like it could actually be possible for me to achieve that “supermodel body” and it kinda scares me. i don’t think that i need that body type to be happy or beautiful anymore, i already am happy and beautiful. however i still want to look like that. (mainly just to see how that version of myself that i’ve dreamed of for years would actually look like ngl hahaha)

so why am i scared of that? is it the lose skin? no, it’ll just bounce back since i’m still young and i’m really not losing that much. 

is it that i’m scared i’ll become a bully myself? no, i have so much love in me and have forgiven all people who’ve wronged me in some way before so i don’t hold any anger anymore. plus i don’t think anyone should ever be bullied, especially not for their looks.

scared of losing my “safety blanket”? nope, don’t need that anymore. 
scared that i won’t be able to recognize myself? no, not that either.

i’ve thought through every single possible reason and the only conclusion i came to is that some little part of me still believes that i don’t deserve to look like i want to look. and that’s okay. today i will choose to be kind to that part, to be kind to myself because i deserve everything i’ve ever dreamed of. i am not worthless and neither are you. 

this was just me rambling for a bit and i know this post doesn’t really offer much advice but i hope that some of you can take something away from it. 

weight loss is such a hard journey and it can put you through absolute hell mentally and emotionally, no matter how much or little you want to lose. you are so incredibly strong for even just being here and i believe in you. you are amazing, incredible and beautiful.

,loseit,"Hi!  A little background about me, very brief but helpful... 35, 5'2, female, moderate ""exercise"" (SAHM of a 4 yr old and 10m old).

After having my son I started gaining weight like crazy. When I had my son 10m ago I was 180 and now I'm 235. It's gotten to the point where I needed to see my doc to get some advice, and I did this past Friday. She suggested I download and use the Lose It app and stick to a calorie goal of 1400 in order to lose about 1-2 lbs a week, then after 10 weeks I can lower my goal to 1200 and stick to that to manage and maintain my loss. She also wants me to stick to a what she called ""vegetarian lite"", lessen my red meat intake, eat veggies high in iron, fiber, and protein. No white foods like white rice, potatoes, white bread (I only eat wheat anyways), sugars. Skip unnecessary sauces like gravy, condiments, and cautiously watch my sodium intake. While this seemed like a lot to me, in the last couple days since our meeting I've been watching what I'm eating and how much of it I am consuming. I thought I was eating well throughout the day, but I've found that I'm only eating my kids leftovers and then binge eating when everyone goes to bed. I'd eat a bowl of cereal, nachos, brownies, all sorts of crap that I was wanting to eat in the day but instead of just saying no to it altogether I justified it with ""well, you busted your ass today with the kids, enjoy what you want!"". Bleh. I felt gross, I knew it was a bad idea but I did it anyway. I digress...

 I want to stick to my docs suggestions, and I have every intention to do what she says. I am subbed to 
r/CICO and while the idea seems straight forward, I still don't get it (which makes me feel stupid and discouraged). My app/doc says 1400 cals, today I only ate 1282, so I have eaten less than what they suggested. Is that good? Am I doing this right? My TDEE calculator says I should be eating 2459 which sounds like way too much. For someone that doesn't work out very much it just sounds like way too many for me and my lifestyle. I'm sure my Lose It app took a deficit into account and projected a 1400 intake to help reach my goal, which would make sense because that's what my doc said as well. Now, I am not good with math whatsoever... So what I'm understanding is this:

According to my data, my caloric intake should be 2459. BUT, I need a deficit to jump start my weight loss, so my doc/app projected a 1400 goal. Thus, my initial ""deficit"" is 1059. Is that right?? For some reason I STILL don't understand the process of CICO. I've posted to the sub and my question has some traction but I'm still not fully getting it...

A little background about me, very brief but helpful... 35, 5&amp;#39;2, female, moderate &amp;quot;exercise&amp;quot; (SAHM of a 4 yr old and 10m old).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having my son I started gaining weight like crazy. When I had my son 10m ago I was 180 and now I&amp;#39;m 235. It&amp;#39;s gotten to the point where I needed to see my doc to get some advice, and I did this past Friday. She suggested I download and use the Lose It app and stick to a calorie goal of 1400 in order to lose about 1-2 lbs a week, then after 10 weeks I can lower my goal to 1200 and stick to that to manage and maintain my loss. She also wants me to stick to a what she called &amp;quot;vegetarian lite&amp;quot;, lessen my red meat intake, eat veggies high in iron, fiber, and protein. No white foods like white rice, potatoes, white bread (I only eat wheat anyways), sugars. Skip unnecessary sauces like gravy, condiments, and cautiously watch my sodium intake. While this seemed like a lot to me, in the last couple days since our meeting I&amp;#39;ve been watching what I&amp;#39;m eating and how much of it I am consuming. I thought I was eating well throughout the day, but I&amp;#39;ve found that I&amp;#39;m only eating my kids leftovers and then binge eating when everyone goes to bed. I&amp;#39;d eat a bowl of cereal, nachos, brownies, all sorts of crap that I was wanting to eat in the day but instead of just saying no to it altogether I justified it with &amp;quot;well, you busted your ass today with the kids, enjoy what you want!&amp;quot;. Bleh. I felt gross, I knew it was a bad idea but I did it anyway. I digress...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to stick to my docs suggestions, and I have every intention to do what she says. I am subbed to 
&lt;a href=""/r/CICO""&gt;r/CICO&lt;/a&gt; and while the idea seems straight forward, I still don&amp;#39;t get it (which makes me feel stupid and discouraged). My app/doc says 1400 cals, today I only ate 1282, so I have eaten less than what they suggested. Is that good? Am I doing this right? My TDEE calculator says I should be eating 2459 which sounds like way too much. For someone that doesn&amp;#39;t work out very much it just sounds like way too many for me and my lifestyle. I&amp;#39;m sure my Lose It app took a deficit into account and projected a 1400 intake to help reach my goal, which would make sense because that&amp;#39;s what my doc said as well. Now, I am not good with math whatsoever... So what I&amp;#39;m understanding is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to my data, my caloric intake should be 2459. BUT, I need a deficit to jump start my weight loss, so my doc/app projected a 1400 goal. Thus, my initial &amp;quot;deficit&amp;quot; is 1059. Is that right?? For some reason I STILL don&amp;#39;t understand the process of CICO. I&amp;#39;ve posted to the sub and my question has some traction but I&amp;#39;m still not fully getting it... Idk if what I&amp;#39;m understanding is right, wrong, or half n half...&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to share the results of a long read through Google Scholar that I took. Hi [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/)!

**About me**

Like 3 years ago I went on Keto and it was awesome, helping me go down from like 215 pounds to 170. I could do like five consecutive pull-ups for the first time without much effort beyond mixing up Keto Chow shakes each evening! (I love those things.)  Co-workers commented on how great I looked! Cool.

Fast forward past a year of pretty easy maintenance, whereupon my doctor puts me on Zoloft, and I gained like twenty pounds back before ditching that for Bupropion, a much friendlier antidepressant that didn’t make me constantly ravenous. But try though I might, I had trouble getting back down to 170 with Keto-- I'm still hovering around 190.

This probably had something to do with the fact that I was living alone when I first lost the weight, and am now living with my fiancee and a number of roommates. Which makes sticking to Keto… substantially more difficult. “Hello I have prepared a delicious fruit pie”, a roommate will say, and I’ll unhinge my jaw and swallow it whole (like a python) thereby breaking ketosis. Which is a bummer.

I also have a couple of other roommates who themselves were having trouble losing weight, as was my fiancee even though she’s way more wonderful and industrious and conscientious than I am. And that inspired me to take a long, interest-fueled trip through Google Scholar, since it turns out that the efficacy of different methods of weight loss is *super* commonly-studied, and ours is a beautiful age where any internet asshole can search through unlimited carefully-indexed studies looking for incredibly specific nuggets of information. *And I am just such an asshole.*

**DISCLAIMER**

So, about me! I’m just a programmer, with no particular expertise in this or any other area. That means I am deeply unqualified to offer any kind of medical advice; my only qualification for doing anything is that I spent a bunch of time skimming online journal articles. So if you get inspired to try anything I talk about in this post, ask your doctor about it before you give it a shot or else you’ll die slowly, painfully, as your poor choices consume you from the inside out. And you will cry out ""why did you betray me, UntrustworthyBastard"" and I'll shrug and gesture at my username.

On to the studies! Let’s start out with

# Non-pharmacological weight loss methods

""Non-pharmacological weight loss methods"" are diet and exercise. This has been studied a lot, and these studies vary pretty dramatically in their results for reasons I'm not totally clear on. Probably they have a lot to do with how well the participants are made to adhere to the prescribed diet/exercise regimens.

Which is actually a core limitation of these studies! Most of these studies are intent-to-treat, which means they all include each participant in the study results *even if the participants don’t follow the diet or do anything differently.* Another way of phrasing this is that these studies measure the long-term efficacy of getting a bunch of people who want to lose weight into a room, and then telling them to go on a calorie deficit/keto diet/whatever (with accompanying pamphlets and sometimes logistical support, like buying them food), and then periodically hassling them afterward for the duration of the study.

Looked at in this light, it’s frankly impressive they were able to tease out any effect sizes at all. I would have liked a review article that broke the participants down into percentiles of weight loss-- that would give us a better idea of the range of outcomes realistically achievable-- but couldn’t find any meta-analyses that did this. Such is life.

**Diet + Exercise**

[Weight-Loss Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Weight-Loss Clinical Trials with a Minimum 1-Year Follow-Up - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002822307014836)

\&gt; *A mean weight loss of 5 to 8.5 kg (5% to 9%) was observed during the first 6 months from interventions involving a reduced-energy diet and/or weight-loss medications with weight plateaus at approximately 6 months. In studies extending to 48 months, a mean 3 to 6 kg (3% to 6%) of weight loss was maintained with none of the groups experiencing weight regain to baseline.* ***In contrast, advice-only and exercise-alone groups experienced minimal weight loss at any time point***.

[Systematic review of long-term weight loss studies in obese adults: clinical significance and applicability to clinical practice | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/0802982)

\&gt; *Dietary/lifestyle therapy provides &lt;5 kg weight loss after 2–4 y, pharmacologic therapy provides 5–10 kg weight loss after 1–2 y, and surgical therapy provides 25–75 kg weight loss after 2–4 y.*

This seems basically consistent with the previous study where over the long term diet and exercise-based interventions, for the most part, lead to 5-10 lbs of maintained weight loss.

[Very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet v. low-fat diet for long-term weight loss: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials | British Journal of Nutrition | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/verylowcarbohydrate-ketogenic-diet-v-lowfat-diet-for-longterm-weight-loss-a-metaanalysis-of-randomised-controlled-trials/6FD9F975BAFF1D46F84C8BA9CE860783)

\&gt; *\[L\]arge randomised clinical trials with long-term dietary interventions aiming weight loss showed that individuals under intensive lifestyle interventions lose about 4·8 kg( 2 , 38 ). Hence, the further reduction of 0·9 kg in the individuals assigned to a \[very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet\] would represent almost 20 % of the awaited weight loss achieved with long-term dietary interventions.*

So tl;dr: Non-calorie-restricted ketogenic diets work *marginally* better than low-fat calorie-restricted diets on average, but not by much-- Keto loses you like 12 pounds, and low-fat diets lose you like 10 pounds.

This is a larger effect size than we saw in earlier studies, which could be explainable by the study length cutoff here was 1 year whereas the earlier, more pessimistic study required like four years of followup to be included in the meta-analysis (leaving more time for weight regain).

What about exercise?

**Exercise**

[Isolated Aerobic Exercise and Weight Loss: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002934311003779)

\&gt; *Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise programs of 6-12 months induce a modest reduction in weight and waist circumference in overweight and obese populations. Our results show that isolated aerobic exercise is not an effective weight loss therapy in these patients. Isolated aerobic exercise provides modest benefits to blood pressure and lipid levels and may still be an effective weight loss therapy in conjunction with diets.*

This, you’ll notice, pretty much aligns with the [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) conventional wisdom on the topic: Exercise alone tends not to do it unless you're Michael Phelps, who my fiancée tells me eats multiple tubs of ice cream each day.

So far, so depressing-- everyone here knows that if you have the industriousness and conscientiousness to stay on a consistent calorie deficit, you’ll lose weight. It's just empirically this doesn't happen to the degree most of us would want. Though don’t forget the study limitations! Intent-to-treat is a harsh mistress, and the use of averages in these study results conceals a *lot* of individual variation in patient response to these diets.

Anyway, on to other, more exotic (but not *that* exotic) methods of weight loss!

# FDA-approved pharmacological interventions

Drugs!

This’ll be a pretty short list; the FDA has a very high bar for safety and efficacy for weight loss drugs, and as such has approved only 9 (?) drugs in this class for current usage, several of which are on-patent and thereby only affordable to the twelve riches members of the Saudi royal family. The FDA's conservative about approving these, since the history of weight loss medications includes shit like Fen-Phen (can kill you) and DNP (can make you go blind and *then* kill you; though at least this one was obvious enough that it was [banned by the FDA at around the same time the FDA got the authority to ban things](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/shilling-for-big-mitochondria).)

So the FDA makes *really fucking sure* these days that there's nothing waiting in the weeds before approving stuff for weight loss. Oftentimes this assurance comes from jamming together drugs with a long history of safe use for other conditions (see the discussion of Contrave below), which seems sensible enough.

As for whether you’d like to take drugs for weight loss, your call-- I know a lot of people on r/loseit take pride in losing weight the natural way, and more power to them. That said, the following is the opinion of the notoriously risk-averse FDA:

\&gt; [The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends pharmacotherapy for weight loss when lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise and behavioural therapy) have failed and the body mass index (BMI) is °30kg/m2 with no concomitant obesity-related risk factors, or if the BMI is °27 kg/m2 and the patient has at least one obesity-related risk factor.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

I'm aware that this does *not* align with the [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) conventional wisdom, which mostly has it that drugs are a dangerous crutch unsuitable for long-term use (and, by implication, short-term use). Which isn't always true! Lots of drugs you can basically stay on forever (such as bupropion, a popular antidepressant). The unknown risks of doing so ultimately must be weighed against the known risks inherent to obesity, which are substantial; in that way, it's a similar cost-benefit analysis as taking drugs for any other chronic condition. I myself will probably be on acid reflux medication until the day I die, and it's *super worth it*.

On that cheery note: to the drugs!

**Orlistat (Xenical)**

\&gt; [weight loss achieved was about 3% \[of total body mass\] greater for subjects taking orlistat than for those taking placebo.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

\&gt; [produces significant gastrointestinal side effects (oily faecal spotting, flatus with discharge, faecal urgency, oily stools, increased defecation, faecal incontinence, abdominal pain) in 15-30% of the patients under treatment, that tend to disappear with time if the patient adheres to a low fat diet.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

Gross.

This one’s notable because almost all of the other weight loss drugs on the market do so via the mechanism of reducing appetite; this one’s an exception, in that it instead stops your body from absorbing some of the fat you eat *whereupon it comes out the other side*.

Let’s move on.

**Phentermine+Topiramate (Qsymia)**

[Clinical utility of phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia™) combination for the treatment of obesity (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3626409/)

In this trial, about 8% of patients with placebo (diet + lifestyle counseling) lost &gt;10% of their body mass; conversely, 47% of patients in the experimental group (diet + lifestyle counseling + Qsymia) lost &gt;10% of their body mass. Note that 1% of people in the experimental group got kidney stones, so drink your water. It sounds like this is a consequence of the topiramate (at least, this appears to be a known side effect of topiramate taken alone.)

[Off-label drugs for weight management (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473499/) has a really interesting discussion of phentermine-- at the time it was approved it was under pretty serious regulatory scrutiny for its structural resemblance to meth (and thus presumed addictive potential); for this reason it was approved for short-term use only, which tends to be interpreted as up to 3 months. Post-approval studies, happily, have failed to find evidence for chemical or psychological dependence regardless of duration of use; the linked article claims:

\&gt; *There was protracted opposition to re-approval from those who maintained the sympathomimetic obesity drugs that had dangerous addiction potential. No evidence of addiction had appeared during 18 years of increasingly frequent use, but the FDA re-approved them all, having silenced the opposition by announcing the drugs would be approved for short-term use only*

\&gt; *US physicians treating obesity \[...\] continued to use phentermine and the other sympathomimetic amine anorectic drugs off-label long-term. Surveys of prescribing practices among physicians treating obesity have confirmed that a majority of these physicians continue to prescribe the sympathomimetics off-label in this manner.*

This is verified in a different study:

[Addiction potential of phentermine prescribed during long-term treatment of obesity | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo201374)

\&gt; *Phentermine abuse or psychological dependence (addiction) does not occur in patients treated with phentermine for obesity.*

And also:

[A Study of Abrupt Phentermine Cessation in Patients in a Wei... : American Journal of Therapeutics (lww.com)](https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/2011/07000/A_Study_of_Abrupt_Phentermine_Cessation_in.5.aspx)

\&gt; *Cravings for the substance abused, the hallmark characteristic of substance dependence and withdrawal, were entirely absent in the phentermine-treated subjects. Abrupt cessation of long-term phentermine therapy does not induce amphetamine-like withdrawal. Long-term phentermine therapy does not induce phentermine cravings. Symptoms observed after abrupt phentermine cessation represent loss of therapeutic effect and are not withdrawal.*

(I emphasize this part because the idea of getting addicted to something freaks me out.)

**Phentermine Alone**

[Effects of a meal replacement system alone or in combination with phentermine on weight loss and food cravings - Moldovan - 2016 - Obesity - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21649)

*&gt; The phentermine group lost 12.1% of baseline body weight compared with 8.8% in the placebo group.*

**Naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave)**

[Contrave, a bupropion and naltrexone combination therapy for the potential treatment of obesity. - Abstract - Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19777400)

\&gt; *Preliminary data demonstrated placebo-subtracted weight losses of 3 to 7% and improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary adverse effect leading to discontinuation of treatment was nausea.*

So a bit less effective than Qsymia based on phase 3 trials, but not by much; the bright side is it’s not a stimulant if you don't like stimulants. The “off-label drugs” article above claims this is sometimes combined with Phentermine but that there is no data on how often this happens or what the results are. Which is unsatisfying.

As an aside, bupropion is just Wellbutrin, an extremely common antidepressant, and naltrexone is an anti-addiction agent they use to get people off alcohol. Naltrexone’s been on the market for 15 years, and Bupropion has been on it since like the 80s. Which makes me suspect it’s quite safe, since we’ve had decades for long-term side effects to make themselves known. Food for thought. Ask your doctor.

(Speaking of long-term effects, very early on they were concerned that Contrave might hurt long-term cardiovascular health, which luckily wasn't observed in practice. Then later they thought it might actually *help* cardiovascular health instead, but [Orexigen fucked up the study](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/05/13/how_not_to_handle_your_clinical_data) so now we'll have to languish in ignorance forever, I guess?)

**Liraglutide (Saxenda)**

Apparently middling effectiveness. I’d paste some sources, but the post is getting long and this drug is like 1000 dollars a month. So maybe look into it if you *shit gold.* (I am, of course, joking-- shitting gold is a contraindication for Liraglutide and other GLP-1 inhibitors. Ask your doctor.)

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;A mean weight loss of 5 to 8.5 kg (5% to 9%) was observed during the first 6 months from interventions involving a reduced-energy diet and/or weight-loss medications with weight plateaus at approximately 6 months. In studies extending to 48 months, a mean 3 to 6 kg (3% to 6%) of weight loss was maintained with none of the groups experiencing weight regain to baseline.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In contrast, advice-only and exercise-alone groups experienced minimal weight loss at any time point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Dietary/lifestyle therapy provides &amp;lt;5 kg weight loss after 2–4 y, pharmacologic therapy provides 5–10 kg weight loss after 1–2 y, and surgical therapy provides 25–75 kg weight loss after 2–4 y.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems basically consistent with the previous study where over the long term diet and exercise-based interventions, for the most part, lead to 5-10 lbs of maintained weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/verylowcarbohydrate-ketogenic-diet-v-lowfat-diet-for-longterm-weight-loss-a-metaanalysis-of-randomised-controlled-trials/6FD9F975BAFF1D46F84C8BA9CE860783""&gt;Very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet v. low-fat diet for long-term weight loss: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials | British Journal of Nutrition | Cambridge Core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hence, the further reduction of 0·9 kg in the individuals assigned to a [very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet] would represent almost 20 % of the awaited weight loss achieved with long-term dietary interventions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise programs of 6-12 months induce a modest reduction in weight and waist circumference in overweight and obese populations. Our results show that isolated aerobic exercise is not an effective weight loss therapy in these patients.

It&amp;#39;s just empirically this doesn&amp;#39;t happen to the degree most of us would want. Though don’t forget the study limitations! Intent-to-treat is a harsh mistress, and the use of averages in these study results conceals a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of individual variation in patient response to these diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to other, more exotic (but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; exotic) methods of weight loss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;FDA-approved pharmacological interventions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drugs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This’ll be a pretty short list; the FDA has a very high bar for safety and efficacy for weight loss drugs, and as such has approved only 9 (?) drugs in this class for current usage, several of which are on-patent and thereby only affordable to the twelve riches members of the Saudi royal family. The FDA&amp;#39;s conservative about approving these, since the history of weight loss medications includes shit like Fen-Phen (can kill you) and DNP (can make you go blind and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; kill you; though at least this one was obvious enough that it was &lt;a href=""https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/shilling-for-big-mitochondria""&gt;banned by the FDA at around the same time the FDA got the authority to ban things&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the FDA makes &lt;em&gt;really fucking sure&lt;/em&gt; these days that there&amp;#39;s nothing waiting in the weeds before approving stuff for weight loss. Oftentimes this assurance comes from jamming together drugs with a long history of safe use for other conditions (see the discussion of Contrave below), which seems sensible enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for whether you’d like to take drugs for weight loss, your call-- I know a lot of people on &lt;a href=""/r/loseit""&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; take pride in losing weight the natural way, and more power to them. That said, the following is the opinion of the notoriously risk-averse FDA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/""&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends pharmacotherapy for weight loss when lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise and behavioural therapy) have failed and the body mass index (BMI) is °30kg/m2 with no concomitant obesity-related risk factors, or if the BMI is °27 kg/m2 and the patient has at least one obesity-related risk factor.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware that this does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; align with the &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/""&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; conventional wisdom, which mostly has it that drugs are a dangerous crutch unsuitable for long-term use (and, by implication, short-term use). Which isn&amp;#39;t always true! Lots of drugs you can basically stay on forever (such as bupropion, a popular antidepressant). The unknown risks of doing so ultimately must be weighed against the known risks inherent to obesity, which are substantial; in that way, it&amp;#39;s a similar cost-benefit analysis as taking drugs for any other chronic condition. I myself will probably be on acid reflux medication until the day I die, and it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;super worth it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that cheery note: to the drugs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orlistat (Xenical)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/""&gt;weight loss achieved was about 3% [of total body mass] greater for subjects taking orlistat than for those taking placebo.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/""&gt;produces significant gastrointestinal side effects (oily faecal spotting, flatus with discharge, faecal urgency, oily stools, increased defecation, faecal incontinence, abdominal pain) in 15-30% of the patients under treatment, that tend to disappear with time if the patient adheres to a low fat diet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one’s notable because almost all of the other weight loss drugs on the market do so via the mechanism of reducing appetite; this one’s an exception, in that it instead stops your body from absorbing some of the fat you eat &lt;em&gt;whereupon it comes out the other side&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phentermine+Topiramate (Qsymia)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3626409/""&gt;Clinical utility of phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia™) combination for the treatment of obesity (nih.gov)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this trial, about 8% of patients with placebo (diet + lifestyle counseling) lost &amp;gt;10% of their body mass; conversely, 47% of patients in the experimental group (diet + lifestyle counseling + Qsymia) lost &amp;gt;10% of their body mass. Note that 1% of people in the experimental group got kidney stones, so drink your water. It sounds like this is a consequence of the topiramate (at least, this appears to be a known side effect of topiramate taken alone.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473499/""&gt;Off-label drugs for weight management (nih.gov)&lt;/a&gt; has a really interesting discussion of phentermine-- at the time it was approved it was under pretty serious regulatory scrutiny for its structural resemblance to meth (and thus presumed addictive potential); for this reason it was approved for short-term use only, which tends to be interpreted as up to 3 months. Post-approval studies, happily, have failed to find evidence for chemical or psychological dependence regardless of duration of use; the linked article claims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;There was protracted opposition to re-approval from those who maintained the sympathomimetic obesity drugs that had dangerous addiction potential. No evidence of addiction had appeared during 18 years of increasingly frequent use, but the FDA re-approved them all, having silenced the opposition by announcing the drugs would be approved for short-term use only&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;US physicians treating obesity [...] continued to use phentermine and the other sympathomimetic amine anorectic drugs off-label long-term. Surveys of prescribing practices among physicians treating obesity have confirmed that a majority of these physicians continue to prescribe the sympathomimetics off-label in this manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is verified in a different study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo201374""&gt;Addiction potential of phentermine prescribed during long-term treatment of obesity | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Phentermine abuse or psychological dependence (addiction) does not occur in patients treated with phentermine for obesity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/2011/07000/A_Study_of_Abrupt_Phentermine_Cessation_in.5.aspx""&gt;A Study of Abrupt Phentermine Cessation in Patients in a Wei... : American Journal of Therapeutics (lww.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Cravings for the substance abused, the hallmark characteristic of substance dependence and withdrawal, were entirely absent in the phentermine-treated subjects. Abrupt cessation of long-term phentermine therapy does not induce amphetamine-like withdrawal. Long-term phentermine therapy does not induce phentermine cravings. Symptoms observed after abrupt phentermine cessation represent loss of therapeutic effect and are not withdrawal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I emphasize this part because the idea of getting addicted to something freaks me out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phentermine Alone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21649""&gt;Effects of a meal replacement system alone or in combination with phentermine on weight loss and food cravings - Moldovan - 2016 - Obesity - Wiley Online Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;gt; The phentermine group lost 12.1% of baseline body weight compared with 8.8% in the placebo group.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://europepmc.org/article/med/19777400""&gt;Contrave, a bupropion and naltrexone combination therapy for the potential treatment of obesity. - Abstract - Europe PMC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Preliminary data demonstrated placebo-subtracted weight losses of 3 to 7% and improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary adverse effect leading to discontinuation of treatment was nausea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a bit less effective than Qsymia based on phase 3 trials, but not by much; the bright side is it’s not a stimulant if you don&amp;#39;t like stimulants. The “off-label drugs” article above claims this is sometimes combined with Phentermine but that there is no data on how often this happens or what the results are. Which is unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, bupropion is just Wellbutrin, an extremely common antidepressant, and naltrexone is an anti-addiction agent they use to get people off alcohol. Naltrexone’s been on the market for 15 years, and Bupropion has been on it since like the 80s. Which makes me suspect it’s quite safe, since we’ve had decades for long-term side effects to make themselves known. Food for thought. Ask your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Speaking of long-term effects, very early on they were concerned that Contrave might hurt long-term cardiovascular health, which luckily wasn&amp;#39;t observed in practice. Then later they thought it might actually &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; cardiovascular health instead, but &lt;a href=""https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/05/13/how_not_to_handle_your_clinical_data""&gt;Orexigen fucked up the study&lt;/a&gt; so now we&amp;#39;ll have to languish in ignorance forever, I guess?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liraglutide (Saxenda)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently middling effectiveness. I’d paste some sources, but the post is getting long and this drug is like 1000 dollars a month. So maybe look into it if you &lt;em&gt;shit gold.&lt;/em&gt; (I am, of course, joking-- shitting gold is a contraindication for Liraglutide and other GLP-1 inhibitors. Ask your doctor.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Non-FDA-Approved Drugs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hahahahaha you fools, do not do this&lt;/p&gt;

33F, 167 cm (~5 ft 5 in), nearly 67kg (~147 lb / ~10.5 st). I had a child in June 2019 and I fared quite well with the weight during pregnancy and PP, I was trying to keep my weight stable. And abused the fact that I was exclusively breastfeeding (I still am and I still do).

Then, COVID and family situations happened (sister got cancer diagnosis and triggered the entire family). I stopped going to the gym a year ago, I let myself go since last September/October and my weight just kept on going up and up and up. 

While this is not the heaviest I've ever been, I don't like what I let happen to me again, since 4 years ago I was in the same predicament, and then 4 years prior, and before that I was a ""not so chubby but definitely not attractive"" teen / young adult who loved to eat my feelings away because I had nothing else to do. I've been anxious since I can remember and depressed since early teen years (maybe 12 - 13).

When I lost the most weight I managed to reach 56.5 kg ( 124.5 lb / 8.9 st) but I was insanely undereating, abusing coffee, diet coke, water and looked for pro-ana tips to not eat. So, while I did not become anorexic, I was trying really hard to count everything that went into my body to achieve my goal of finally ""not being fat"". 

Just before I got pregnant I was in the absolute best shape of my life. I was doing MMA for one hour a day, 4-5 days a week, trying to eat right and moderate my terrible sweet tooth and tendency to want to eat until I feel full; and, while I never went lower of 61 kg, I had muscles and I liked that. Granted, I never ever have had abs, but I was going to work towards that. 

Well, I am now faced with the decision of changing lifestyles. While I'm not obese (yet), being overweight is less than ideal. And since I have a child, I want to be a good example and also to be congruent with what I try to teach her to eat well and what not. Also, I want to be here a long time if possible to do my bit and then see her grow. But in the more immediate future, I'm thinking on baby #2. And given the fact that one shouldn't lose weight during pregnancy, I also worry about being healthy while pregnant. So my goal at the moment is my own health. I need to lose the weight to be able to gain it back while pregnant (so I don't gain more than necessary and not harm myself or baby with that much weight). I also shouldn't be this heavy as I've a ""broken"" disc in my back (congenital defect, was cartilage not bone and in the base of the back, so really shouldn't put on much weight if I want it to stay in place and not displace further). 

I seriously lacked motivation because I'm tired and I don't like myself, so why bother. 

But I made my resolve this week and began to take action, and for the first time in over a year (maybe more) I counted my calories to get a good deficit and exercised to further it more.

I am keeping on track today, but I may need advice or tips or some kind of support to keep going in the right direction.

I’m curious how much I should be walking, if I can walk on a treadmill, if I should only do 10 mins at a time, etc. I’m doing some core exercises but I don’t think that’ll help me lose weight.

I have gained 30+ lbs since my car accident (when the injury to my back occurred) 1.5 years ago and I yearn to be active one day again. Before the accident I ran with my dog every morning, went on hikes, etc. All that stopped due to the debilitating back pain so I became very sedentary.

I’m curious how much I should be walking, if I can walk on a treadmill, if I should only do 10 mins at a time, etc. I’m doing some core exercises but I don’t think that’ll help me lose weight. I’ll call his PA to get more info, but I’m curious what has worked for those who have had surgeries / injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 9 weeks post-op from my microdiscectomy and just weighed myself. I have gained 30+ lbs since my car accident (when the injury to my back occurred) 1.5 years ago and I yearn to be active one day again. Before the accident I ran with my dog every morning, went on hikes, etc. All that stopped due to the debilitating back pain so I became very sedentary.

,loseit,"This is a pretty big milestone in my journey.  I was nervous before my Doctor's appointment because I hadn't lost as much weight as I had wanted since the last check in.  

I ended up being 2lbs lighter than the last time I was there for an a1c check.  Not great, but I can't complain about weighing less.  Blood pressure was good so I was just waiting on the doc.  He comes in and doesn't sit down like usual, which I found odd.  Then he tells me my a1c dropped(I was diagnosed type 2 last Sept).  ""Good!""  is what I thought in my head.  A little drop is better than nothing.

Then he tells me it dropped from 6.9 to 6.3

And he says ""You are no longer in the diabetic range""

I didn't know how to act.  

He thinks the slowdown in weight loss is due to me starting to lift again, and wants to follow up with me in 6 months.  I started with an a1c of 7.4 last September.  

All I want to do is get off these meds, and that's a damn good update.  Hopefully if I stick with my routine and diet I can go ahead and get back to a normal life.  Feels good knowing the work I'm putting in is paying off.

Edit:  Thank you everyone.  I may be able to answer a few repeat questions better here.

My family has a history of obesity and health conditions like diabetes.  This was a nonfactor when I was active, but I went through a period in college where I was not happy.  Ate a lot of fast food and stayed indoors.  It carried through for a few years and got me here today.  I had to really dig deep and start loving myself to make the beginning of a change.

I started with cutting my fast food intake in half, and then eating ""healthy options"".  This dropped my first 20lbs.  At the time exercising was very difficult.  So this was the best I could do.  Eventually I pushed myself, and have now worked up to being able to workout 4-5 days a week.  I've also cut down my fast food consumption to about once a week now(for anyone struggling with this, it took me over a year to reach this level of discipline.  remind yourself what you should have eaten after fast food meals.  eventually you start choosing those options without thinking.  At least that's what I did.).

Believe it or not my diet has been aided by this 20 dollar crockpot I bought around christmas.  The recipes are easy, and knowing I have super tasty food at home keeps me from eating out.  I aim for 2 meals a day with snacks inbetween.  Keeps me from overeating, and if I ever feel low energy I just eat bigger meals.

Snacks consist mainly of apples and veggies(I lied mainly apples.  I need to eat more veggies).  The fiber fills me up and it's very hard to overeat on these foods.  Water helps too.  I TRY to drink a gallon a day. 

For a while I was doing an hour on the treadmill with an incline.  This worked from 295-280, then I had a stall.  My treadmill broke around the same time my friend started a home gym, so within the past month and a half I've been getting back into my college workouts(squats,bench,sqwats lol!).  I'm having fun in the gym again.  I've been focusing a lot on leg strength and jumping ability so I can play basketball for weight loss.  I managed to get a 36inch box jump off vert at 270!  That was a good moment.

So now I'm here.  Home scale says 260, which is about halfway to my goal of 205.  I know the meds will be here a while, but I want to have the option to get off them asap.  So I plan to work really hard before my next appointment.  I will have a lot of time in the summer, and normally if I have the energy I can drop weight fairly quick with enough rest.  I am trying to do this properly so I don't have a lot of loose skin, but now that I'm getting close to the turning point where every lb looks like a more drastic change, I'm ready to see it.

Look out for another good update in the next coming months.  Thank you guys for the support.

,loseit,"Hey everyone,
Apologies for any mistakes, I don't frequently make posts here, but am looking for some advice.
I'm female, 27 years old 5'6 and around 137 lbs.

I am relatively in shape but just trying to lose the extra pounds I have and tone up.

I have been finding it very difficult to lose this weight although I have been tracking calories, working out intensely for an hour a day (according to my fitness watch I burn around 250-400 calories during this, although I think that is a bit of an overshot, also worth mentioning that I do not eat exercise calories back) and sometimes incorporating a walk. Because I wasn't seeing much progress I came to the conclusion that working from home, I haven't been as active as I normally would be and I cut down my calories to 1200 a day.

This is where I am stuck. I began seeing faster progress but I felt awful, insomnia, irritable and tired and a preoccupation with food. I have now had to take a few days off exercise to feel normal again. I've realised that this figure was perhaps too low so I've decided to bump up to 1400 calories.

My question is, do you think this would be enough of a deficit to lose weight?

I appreciate that everyone's body is different and reacts in different ways, but any advice is appreciated all the same.

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to** r/Loseit!

&amp;#x200B;

So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why you’re overweight

&amp;#x200B;

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before You Start

&amp;#x200B;

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tracking

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

&amp;#x200B;

# Creating Your Deficit

&amp;#x200B;

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Exercise

&amp;#x200B;

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Crawl, Walk, Run

&amp;#x200B;

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Acceptance

&amp;#x200B;

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.

,loseit,"Backstory: I grew up in an abusive household with almost no access to food. Binge eating kept me alive. When I moved out at 18 I was so poorly acclimated to stable food that I gained 100lbs in less than six months before I realized what I had done to my body.  

A few years ago I lost about 60lbs through calorie counting, getting treatment for my asthma, and consequently finally being able to exercise! 
But then financial tragedy hit, I lost access to my gym and asthma medicine, I was stressed and food insecure, which triggered my binge eating and I gained a lot of weight back. Got it under control, lost 20 or so pounds, sat there for a while since I was still struggling financially and stressed.    

Then covid hit too. Spouse and I lost our jobs. We were eating rice and beans we got from charitable neighbors for two months- we were ineligible for a lot of aid since we got most of our income from self employment. Cue more food insecurity and when we did start getting paid again it was inconsistent so I was binging, starving, binging again. I gained more weight and now I'm the biggest I've ever been. 

We are financially stable again. I have a job and insurance and I'm about to get back on my asthma treatments for the first time in a few years.  I want to seek therapy for my disordered eating but I'm worried that since it only happens in bursts as a result of triggers which will hopefully not be present anymore, that therapy will help me out for now, I'll get comfortable and lower my guard, and I'll get triggered again years down the line and ruin all my progress once more. 

Did therapy help you overcome disordered eating on a long term basis? What were your takeaways from therapy? How did they help you? Ive only been to one therapist in my life, one visit, and she shamed me for being queer, told me to leave my partner and change my whole lifestyle and it overwhelmed me so much I never saw a therapist again.  I could really use some support and encouragement  here because I'm sitting here looking at what seems like a perfect therapist, and 12 free sessions this year through my job, and I still have this awful feeling in my gut that it will be a terrible idea.

I plan to start my acting career in 2021. So I need to step up my weight loss journey by a LOT. I’ve been doing everything that I can. Granted, My eating habits still aren’t the best. I’m working on it. I need to stick to 1,500 calories, Anything less I felt too faint for my weight or anything above that will make me gain more as I’m training. So it’s a good start for me. Eventually as I lose more I’d like to lower it to 1,200 when I get closer to 210 lbs. Now I almost gave up my acting career over the weekend before I even started it. I’ve been in one play recently with a lead role and I loved it. I still want to go for it since it’s something I really want to do!! 

Anyway back to my weight. Like I said I haven’t been eating the best, I had a cheat weekend which I haven’t done in a long time, I just gave into a few small cravings and didn’t over indulge like I used to do. I was careful and actually lost 3 lbs this weekend! I was shocked. I have been trying to drink more water, Haven’t really been counting but it’s at least 100+ Oz. The serving is 42 when I fill up my water filter half way, And I drink at least 3 a day. I won’t be having another cheat day for a while, Because it made me feel like crap. It literally made me sick and I still don’t feel well from yesterday. 

I need to lose exactly 12 lbs a month to lose 70 lbs before this year has ended. I will have an extra month in December, I hope I won’t get too off track by then. I’ve hit a pause for the last two weeks. But once I get back into meal prepping I should be fine right? I usually lose about 3 lbs a week when I do this, Which is too fast for most but it’s what I need! I was never in such a rush before, But I want to look my best so I can start sending out those acting auditions. I don’t think I’m in an obsessive state yet, And I am being careful. I don’t workout for long hours, In fact I mostly only have 30 minutes at the gym since my ride is always late but I am going to start getting there early and workout for a full hour again! My arms are already tightening/getting smaller, That’s always the hardest part but it was small when I was training before so maybe that’s why it only took 3 weeks this time around. My chest is still huge but not as bad as it was- I can tell by my size, it doesn’t fit anymore. I’ve noticed that I lost most of the fat in my back, Which was quite hard to get rid of as well. So it’s mostly upper body that I need to work on, My lower body is pretty good right now but I will be keeping up with both. I think HIIT will help with that.

I usually lose about 3 lbs a week when I do this, Which is too fast for most but it’s what I need! I was never in such a rush before, But I want to look my best so I can start sending out those acting auditions. I don’t think I’m in an obsessive state yet, And I am being careful. I don’t workout for long hours, In fact I mostly only have 30 minutes at the gym since my ride is always late but I am going to start getting there early and workout for a full hour again! My arms are already tightening/getting smaller, That’s always the hardest part but it was small when I was training before so maybe that’s why it only took 3 weeks this time around. My chest is still huge but not as bad as it was- I can tell by my size, it doesn’t fit anymore. I’ve noticed that I lost most of the fat in my back, Which was quite hard to get rid of as well. So it’s mostly upper body that I need to work on, My lower body is pretty good right now but I will be keeping up with both. I think HIIT will help with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Is this possible to lose 70 lbs before the year is over? Have you done it or lost even more in 9 months?&lt;/p&gt;

I started trying to lose weight in October last year and from October 1st to like mid December I lost 7 kg (about 15 pounds). But ever since then I started to lose focus and started bad eating habits again. At first I just plateaued, but ever since mid January, maybe it was coincidence, maybe causation, when I started studying for my exams, I let myself go big time and gained back about 3 kg (6.6 pounds). Now that my exams are over, I am having a hard time getting my eating habits back on track.

At least I still do home workouts with a friend (just digitally, of course) 3 times a week and if the weather and Covid regulations allow it, I will be able to go horseback riding again every other week, so I have the exercise part covered.

I wanted to make a post to make myself more accountable and comment to update on my weekly progress. I hope this will also give me back some of my motivation to eat healthier.

Well, as of today, March 7 2021, I weight 74 kg (163 pounds). My goal is to lose between 500 g to 1 kg per week (1 to 2 pounds) and my goal weight is 60 kg (132 pounds).

I knew that eating healthier and exercise would give me some benefits immediately, but I did not expect to notice them so quickly! 

My husband and I decided enough was enough and two weeks ago we would start steps to develop lifelong healthy habits. We started focusing on CICO and eating more fruits/veggies with at least every meal. I’ve also been adding more walks and some at home exercises such as  push-ups, sit ups, and some YouTube workout videos. 

Within two weeks, I have already lost five pounds which I was pleased with. We decided to do a non-food treat that should encourage us to keep going. 

Before, my back would start to hurt after walking around the store without a cart around the 15 min mark. Today, we walked around with no cart for about 30 min and it didn’t hurt! My back is already getting stronger and my body is adjusting.

First Post for me, I've been a massive lurker here! Trying to see what might work for me and see other people's experiences.

I'm Male(25), 5ft 4 (wasn't blessed with a tall gene!) and now come in at 202lbs.
Looking at healthy weight calculators; I should be coming in at around 145lbs. Now I haven't been that weight for nearly 7 years; it's crept on incredibly slowly. Being in a relationship has been great, but as we're extremely comfortable together; it was more about enjoyment then taking care of ourselves.

I've managed to lose about 2 stone before but I just get so bored! Eating salad really really bores me. I didn't have healthy food practices instilled in me when growing up; so I struggle. So it piles back on. Lockdown hasn't helped either due to motivation; and I haven't been able to exercise well for about 5 years as I had undiagnosed compartment syndrome in both legs (managed to get them operated in December last year) and I'm now able to walk without intense pain.

I really want to stay motivated; but do struggle. I'm fine managing my breakfasts and lunch; I have no control over dinner apart from portion sizing and not having takeaways due to living with family (not a good cook, not an excuse though).

Just thought I'd post a bit about me, and visit here for motivation. I really struggle with having an off day, and just fall off the wagon.

Keep in mind that i had been overweight (for my short posture) since my early teenage years. At that point, I cant even remember the last time my weight considered normal, so i have this fixed image in my head about how i look, a self body image of my chubby self, fast forward 3 years and i still have that image in my head even though in reality i don’t look like that anymore.

I never took losing weight seriously until I was married and had a daughter on the way, weighing in excess of 350 pounds. I began low-carb dieting in 2003, and went from my all time high of 364 to 270 or so...then stuck there for years. I dabbled sometimes, getting as low as 240, but probably still spent a decade doing that bounce-around. I never got above 280 again, but I got close, and then I'd lose a bit here and again. I'm 5'10"" tall.

Since I'd experienced life at 350+, I was *kind* of satisfied. There is a huge functional difference with 100 pounds gone. You feel it in everything you do. 

During the pandemic, I decided I wanted more. I stuck more seriously to carb restriction and added a 16-hour fast, which was both surprisingly easy and amazingly effective. I am now at 214 pounds and losing 3-4 pounds a month. My fasts sometimes go 20 hours -- and I hardly notice. 

I also gave up the gym due to Covid and instead of strength training, I added on running. I've probably lost at least some muscle in the transition, but my belly and face are much smaller now.

Anyway, I realized something the other day. Was at dinner with some work colleagues who I've worked with for years.  Never considered either of them overweight, and they asked about it. I was the lightest guy at the table by a good 15 pounds. Among my friends, I'm lighter than most all of them. Two of my three brothers are heavier than me, and the other isn't much lighter. I realize that I'm not remarkably overweight these days. 

It's kind of an eye-opening moment when you consider how used to being the fat guy, the big guy, the roundest guy around -- and suddenly you *aren't*.

,loseit,"Hi there! So I am new to this subreddit and I just wanted to share how my weight loss journey started and how things are going.

In May of 2020, I (24F, 5'6"") was diagnosed with a metabolic/hormonal condition called PCOS. I was at a fairly normal weight for my height back in high school, but it progressively got worse throughout college. I figured it was just due to the stress and lack of sleep, but after getting my diagnosis it made a lot more sense since weight gain is one of the main symptoms of the condition. Throughout most of my time in college, I was roughly 238 lbs and would fluctuate +/-2 lbs. I tried to work out when I could in between my classes and job, but nothing was really working. When I got my diagnosis last year that's when I realized I really needed to do something about it, especially since my condition puts me at risk for type 2 diabetes (which I already had a risk of genetically since my mom has it).

Anyways, over the past year since the diagnosis, I started to make small changes in my eating habits such as switching from my refined carb intake to whole grains, reducing my sugar intake, eating more protein and healthy fats, etc. I also started to walk every day and swim a couple of times a week. When I followed up with my doctor in October, I had dropped down to 231. It honestly didn't feel like much, but my doctor commended me for it. I then started working a job that requires a lot of walking and lifting (I work in a special ed classroom as an assistant, it definitely keeps me active). I kept up with what I was doing but slacked during December because our classroom had to quarantine and the pool I swam at closed.

I got back on it in February and joined a gym thanks to a discount, and got two free sessions with a personal trainer (I can't afford to buy a program unfortunately), but in the first session, he showed me some resistance exercises I can do in addition to my swimming and other cardio. The first one focused on upper body exercises, the second one when I have it will focus on lower body and abs. I will get to keep meeting with the trainer monthly but just as a check-in about my goals since I'm not doing a program. I've also started going to a yoga class once a week and am really enjoying it as well.

As for my progress, I just weighed myself at the gym yesterday and I dropped down to 224.6 lbs! I was so happy, I've officially lost about 14 lbs since my diagnosis and I'm going to keep working hard at it so I can get my BMI below 30! And this also feels amazing because a shirt that used to be a bit snug on me, fits better now than it used to! So I know that it's working and I just wanted to share with you all. PCOS is known to make it difficult for women who have it to lose weight and the solutions for dealing with the symptoms associated with are also variable, I'm glad that I've finally found something that is working! :D So even if you are struggling and/or have a condition like this, there is hope, don't give up!",t2_13eqxp9z,False,,0,False,Finally starting to see progress!,[],r/loseit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lzluye,False,dark,0.84,,public,16,0,{},67c24d52-c3a4-11e5-a551-0e30909a2135,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,16,,False,,False,blank,[],{},,True,,1615131541.0,text,6,,,text,self.loseit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there!

,loseit,"I've been following this page for the last little while in hopes that it will motivate me to finally fight for my happiness. This post is a bit all over the place, so I apologise in advance!

I'm not obese or that overweight by any means, and I know that my current weight is a lot of people's goal weight. 

I've dealt with anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and everything in between. 3 years ago I moved to NZ to be with my boyfriend, and it's been a journey (in terms of my health). 

I joined a diet centre when I was 18 because some guy stopped talking to me because he thought I was fat. I had always been the big girl in class since I was a kid, so this hurt me. 

Worst. Decision. Of. My. Life. This honestly ruined me. I know that so many people have found success with CICO, and I wish I could because it seems to work really well for so many people. But this lead to so many obsessive behaviours that I'm still trying to shake to this day (I'm 29 now). 

I moved to Vancouver when I was 20 to attend university, while in a long distance relationship with a guy back home (Montreal). I got depressed, dropped out of uni, gained all the weight that I had lost when I was 18, and then some. I think the highest I ever weighed was about 200lbs. I'm 5'6"" and carry it all in my mid section. So I wasn't feeling too great about myself, as you can imagine. Managed to lose some of it, I think I got down to 170lbs through yoga and running.

When I was 22 I moved to Australia and for some reason just stopped caring about calories, was drinking heaps, but I was super active (going to the gym 5x a week with one of our flatmates and snowboarding almost every day). The weight seemed to melt off. I think I got down to 160lbs, but I still thought I was fat. Although I remember this time fondly because I ate food and enjoyed it.

A few years later, Australian boyfriend and I broke up, and I moved back to Canada. Stopped drinking, joined a gym, was cycling everywhere, rock-climbing, hiking, snowboarding and everything in between. Fittest I had ever looked and felt in my life. I think I got down to 145lbs (but it still wasn't enough). 

Wasn't really sure what I was doing with my life, jumped between cities, gained weight, lost weight. 

Finally ended up moving to NZ 3 years ago to be with my partner (whom I met in Australia). Weight's gone up and down but has consistently been around 175lbs. Fitness is non existent at the moment (my partner has a broken spine from snowboarding so the activities we can do together that don't cause him more pain are limited). Started eating everything and anything, but I have stopped counting calories. I've been enjoying a lot of foods, but I still don't feel great in my skin. I look at pictures of myself and I don't like what I see. 

I've tried doing Whole30 on and off (and I'm currently doing one now - on day 22). I downloaded MFP the other night just for fun, I thought I might be in the right headspace to use it effectively after all these years. Nope. Binged on RxBars and everything else tonight. 

And so I have realised that I am still not where I need to be with my relationship with myself, and food. I've come a hell of a long way, but there's still work to be done. 

I want to do it right for me. Right for my boyfriend. I am so tired of letting food control me and this idea that I have to ""work out"" when all I want is to enjoy food, enjoy activities, and enjoy life. I'm currently at 163 lbs and my goal is 145-150lbs. This is where I feel good. Not perfect, but really good. I've never had a six-pack and I don't think I ever will. And that's okay! I don't need one, but I do want to feel comfortable and capable.

I think I got down to 145lbs (but it still wasn&amp;#39;t enough). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#39;t really sure what I was doing with my life, jumped between cities, gained weight, lost weight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally ended up moving to NZ 3 years ago to be with my partner (whom I met in Australia). Weight&amp;#39;s gone up and down but has consistently been around 175lbs. Fitness is non existent at the moment (my partner has a broken spine from snowboarding so the activities we can do together that don&amp;#39;t cause him more pain are limited). Started eating everything and anything, but I have stopped counting calories. I&amp;#39;ve been enjoying a lot of foods, but I still don&amp;#39;t feel great in my skin. I look at pictures of myself and I don&amp;#39;t like what I see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried doing Whole30 on and off (and I&amp;#39;m currently doing one now - on day 22). I downloaded MFP the other night just for fun, I thought I might be in the right headspace to use it effectively after all these years. Nope. Binged on RxBars and everything else tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I have realised that I am still not where I need to be with my relationship with myself, and food. I&amp;#39;ve come a hell of a long way, but there&amp;#39;s still work to be done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to do it right for me. Right for my boyfriend. I am so tired of letting food control me and this idea that I have to &amp;quot;work out&amp;quot; when all I want is to enjoy food, enjoy activities, and enjoy life. I&amp;#39;m currently at 163 lbs and my goal is 145-150lbs. This is where I feel good. Not perfect, but really good. I&amp;#39;ve never had a six-pack and I don&amp;#39;t think I ever will. And that&amp;#39;s okay! I don&amp;#39;t need one, but I do want to feel comfortable and capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for reading if you&amp;#39;ve made it this far. This post ended up being a lot longer than I thought. Tomorrow is a new day!&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"A lot of people recommend sedentary no matter what your life style is and often recommend 1,200 calories for women despite their lifestyle. 

My sedentary would have me at 1,400 to lose 1 pound a week. Well I really thought that was wrong and that my actual tdee was closer to 2300 so I could eat 1700 and lose a pound per week. A lot of people suggested to me that I eat 1200 and it wasn’t possible my tdee was that high. 

Well I’ve been eating 1700 for 4 weeks now and have been losing 2 pounds a week (so from 180 to 172) at a very steady rate. I went to the doctor a few days ago and he took measurements and ran some tests to find out my fat/muscle composition and asked a lot of questions about my activity levels and determined my tdee was definitely between 2500-2800. 

He recommended I stay above 1500 since I’m apparently pretty active and he thinks I need the extra calories. I waitress and have a second job as an artist (doing murals or teaching) so I’m on my feet for 8+ hours a day and run for a mile or 2 run in the morning and life weights and stuff) 

In other words if you really feel your tdee is higher than sedentary they just try it higher for a few weeks. Give it 3 weeks at 1500 or 1700 or even 2000 and see if you notice any changes. There is no rush in weight loss. I actually only wanted to lose 1 pound a week because I only have 30 (22 now) to lose so I was just gonna get it done in 30 weeks. 

If you notice changes then just stay at that higher calorie until you stop seeing changes. If you don’t see changes then you can lower it. It’s all trial and error. You don’t have to eat 1200 a day being an active person and feeling like crap because you’re burning so much.

,loseit,"TL;DR: I (25F) was always naturally skinny and now that I’ve gained weight I realize I know nothing about how food actually works or what it takes to eat healthy. Looking for tips, advice, or just stories to relate to. 

I guess I can start with some background here. Growing up my family was kinda poor. We survived, but food was always cheap and a “eat what you get” ideology. I was also always naturally skinny. To the point where family asked me if I was anorexic even though I was constantly eating. This persisted through most of college. I would just eat what ever and my metabolism was so high it didn’t matter. 

A couple of years ago I was hanging out with a work friend (pre-pandemic) and we were looking through old photos, and she made a comment about how I used to be SO skinny in high school (but not like in mean way). It kinda jarred me though. And now (post-pandemic) I weigh even more than I did when that comment was made. 

I’m not super overweight by any means, but I’m also not the super skinny person I was used to being. I want to try and lose like 20 lbs. I can see the weight gain now and my self-esteem is shot. My face is fatter, I have a beer gut, and I have stretch marks all over my thighs and hips. I really want to get back into shape but I don’t know where to start. 

I don’t have a job right now, so I can’t really buy a lot of the foods I want. But it’s finally not -10F outside so I’m going to start walking/jogging again. Other than that I don’t really know where to start. 

I’ve looked a little bit into fasting (Intermittent and OMAD). But I realized that I basically already do that. I just don’t understand how to actually plan my meals and count calories and things like that. Like, I don’t think its healthy OMAD to just eat a big bowl of spaghetti for dinner lol. Being poor has left me with some really bad habits. Because a bowl of pasta or a couple potatoes is better than not eating I guess. 

I’ve slowly been getting more and more into cooking. And not the “just buy everything pre-made and warm it up” kind of cooking, but actually making stuff from scratch. I don’t really follow recipes except for baking. But without recipes I don’t really know anything about what I’m making. Sure I can cook a piece of salmon with some veggies and potatoes, but I have no idea how portions work, or what kinda nutrients are in the food, or how many calories I’m eating, etc. 

Where do I even begin in trying to learn about diets and nutrition? How do you make nutritious food? How do you know what you need? How do you make serving sizes when you cook for yourself? How do you track your calorie intake and outtake? What actually does it take to eat and live healthier? Do you just google everything you put into your recipes? Because that sounds super tedious and I doubt I could keep the motivation to do that. I’ve also been curious about meal-prep but I don’t know anything about that either.

,loseit,"Now, obviously I have always had gut-related sounds in my life. I think the technical term is borborygmus. But since I've lost around 50lbs (about half of the weight I need to lose) things have gotten much, much louder.

,loseit,"This is my first time posting so bear with me on this. I'm a 24 FtM trans man who has been on T for two years but has seen little weight loss b/c of it, only fat redistribution. A few months back I started up a new diet and began keeping track of my steps and my heart rate as well as calories. I fell off the wagon a few weeks ago but even before then I found myself hitting a wall. I came down from 210 to 185 but couldn't get any lower than that. Considering I'm only 5'1, clearly I can do better. 

I think the biggest issue is my calorie count. I was sticking to a general 2,300 but found after a while that on busy days I could only eat 3 meals instead of the 4 I normally need, whereas it was almost too many calories on not busy days. 

For me, busy days means working a shift at both of my jobs. I wake up at 6am and clock in to the first at 7am, then switch at 1pm to the other job where I stay till after 9pm. I'm on my feet nearly the entire day, moving, sweating, and staying active (my step counter is usually between 15 and 20k on these days). I typically have a pre-prepared light breakfast like a protein shake or some eggs, a heavier lunch at the first job, then dinner at the second, and finally another light meal once I get home. The 2300 calorie count severely restricted what I could eat during these days, so I'd often skip one of the meals or eat something tiny, which often  resulted in me feeling sick from hunger for hours. (Ever since I started T, being too hungry gives me awful acid reflux so I try to avoid it when I can) 

Conversely, on days when I'm off, I still feel like I need to eat a ton but am not actually hungry enough to get the whole 2300 calories down. I'd often just snack lightly throughout the day, have dinner, and end up somewhere around 1800 calories. 

Im not really sure where I can make a change to help me get over this 185 hump. Do I adjust my calories on days when I work doubles to allow for a 4th meal, then trim down on days off, or should I only aim for 3 meals and deal with the acid reflux? Is it okay to stagger my calorie counts daily or should I be aiming for something more steady?

,loseit,"this winter i've hardly gone anywhere or done anything and it's pretty shocking how little i move.  i've been focusing the last two years or so on my diet, basically learning to cook, eat real foods and managing grocery bills, but haven't made any real effort to get more active.  i mean, consistently active, not just going for a bike ride on a nice summer day and then doing nothing.  also, yoga's great and everything but it isn't really cutting it.  this winter, my lack of movement has been so bad, my bowels are feeling it and i've been constipated on and off for months.  just walking hasn't been enough to work that out.  even if i walk an hour or so, i'm still sitting around the rest of the day.

in an effort to move more, i decided to try one of those aerobics workout videos.  i've wanted to try them for a while now but i've always felt kind of self-conscious (in my own home even) about the idea.  timing my first try for when i knew i'd be home alone, i gave one a shot.  two things immediately struck me: 1) i am slow AF 2) i'm so sedentary it feels weird to move.  just throwing a punch was like the most alien move.  so many movements were just awkward and unsteady.  and they move fast, i never realized my pace was so slow! 

the exercises may look easy and most of them are, but doing them at a really fast pace is sort of the key.  let me tell you, i felt it the next day, but pushed through it again.  my body adjusted quick and it's also pretty great just to move with more strength and balance, which brings me to the third thing that struck me: this is great!  i've always hated aerobic exercise because it's mostly high impact.  running, jogging, jumping rope, great exercise but all killers on your joints.  i've been heavy my whole life, so that's always been a problem for me.  also, these workouts are exactly the right pace.  they do me in every time, but i can still do them daily.  

finally, glad to say i'll be getting back to work and starting a new, physical and pretty fast-paced job next week.  it'll be killer to be on my feet all day again, and i know it's going to be a really rough first week or so but i need it!

these are the aerobics workouts i've been doing and i highly recommend them!  it's a great youtube channel all 'round and there are tons of other routines besides these couple i'll suggest.

,loseit,"Ok so basically what I mean to say is, for those who have been “on a diet” for most of their teen/adult lives but never seemed to fall through in the long run, what is it about this time that you’re certain is going to be successful? Whether you’re currently losing weight or have already accomplished your goals, was there, or has there ever been, a moment where it all sort of just clicked and you finally realized that success was in your grasp?

I’m asking because I’m the yo-yo girl. I’ve struggled with EDs from the age of 10, I am a frequent dieter in my adult life, and I have a history of crash landing into months-long periods of binge eating. In January of 2019 I finally admitted I had a problem and I decided to seek out therapy for my tumultuous relationship with food. In the last 2 years I have lost 30lbs which is a drop in the ocean compared to what I want to lose but I feel those 30lbs have taught me valuable lessons. 

This January I took those lessons and decided to get serious about weight loss and I’m down 11lbs in 2 months, which is great! Everyday is less an exercise in restraint and more of a practice in forgiveness. I no longer punish myself for eating a burger every once in a while. The difference is that because I no longer see burgers as “evil” I can now stop at eating 1 of them and I move on to the next meal with no guilt attached. My guilt used to fuel my binge eating and now it’s gone. I’m also able to calorie count for the first time in my life without triggering the ED I had as a child/teen. 

This switch in my mentality towards food and my body has led me to believe that this is “it”. This is finally the moment I’ve been yearning for my whole life. I feel like I’m finally going to succeed at the one thing I’ve failed time and time again. But that’s the thing, I’ve failed countless times and my confidence cripples when I remember all the times I’ve gassed myself up in the past to only fall on my face a few weeks later.

,loseit,"Hello!A little backstory to elaborate: I suffered from binge eating, practically since I was 12. I've always had an odd relationship to food, where I never felt full. I was never severely obese (perhaps on the verge, according to my BMI). Last year I dropped 17kg (due to horrible anxiety -- yes I have a diagnosis), then gained 9kg back after drinking a lot with friends, once I moved back home from my studies. For the first time in my life I've felt motivated to actually make a HEALTHY change. Not to try out these crazy diets for ""rapid weight loss"". I just joined a gym, and I'm loving it! I love the soreness, the feeling of being genuinely and physically tired so I can sleep at night. My only issue is sticking to eating healthy, so I can actually lose fat. I am a huge lover of sweets, and think it's hard to control myself around not buying any.

My main goal is to drop in fat so I can be around 20% (I believe I'm around 29% - but need to use a proper device for an accurate result). I also have a goal of attaining a HEALTHY relationship to food. I'd say I've made progress by not binge eating like I used to. Sure, I'll have ""bad"" days where I indulge by eating crap.

I&amp;#39;ve always had an odd relationship to food, where I never felt full. I was never severely obese (perhaps on the verge, according to my BMI). Last year I dropped 17kg (due to horrible anxiety -- yes I have a diagnosis), then gained 9kg back after drinking a lot with friends, once I moved back home from my studies. For the first time in my life I&amp;#39;ve felt motivated to actually make a HEALTHY change. Not to try out these crazy diets for &amp;quot;rapid weight loss&amp;quot;. I just joined a gym, and I&amp;#39;m loving it! I love the soreness, the feeling of being genuinely and physically tired so I can sleep at night. My only issue is sticking to eating healthy, so I can actually lose fat. I am a huge lover of sweets, and think it&amp;#39;s hard to control myself around not buying any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main goal is to drop in fat so I can be around 20% (I believe I&amp;#39;m around 29% - but need to use a proper device for an accurate result). I also have a goal of attaining a HEALTHY relationship to food. I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;ve made progress by not binge eating like I used to. Sure, I&amp;#39;ll have &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; days where I indulge by eating crap. Or simply over eating, but not actually bingeing for comfort. What I want to know, for a &amp;quot;full recovery&amp;quot;, is how do/did you drop in fat without having compulsions to over eat sweets/unhealthy foods? I&amp;#39;d love to hear about any experiences and tips!&lt;/p&gt;

Plateaus are that tedious, disheartening phase when the scale will not budge. You’re keeping to the calorie count and everything! Why won’t it go down? This question is what I want to answer.

When you keep a calorie deficit, your body is burning fat or muscle. It has to. So why won’t the weight go down? Because your body is also holding on to a bunch of water. What happened with me was almost like clock work. I would keep a deficit, the scale stayed put, until one day I had to pee like CRAZY. Your plateau could just be your body getting ready to piss out LITERAL POUNDS OF WATER. I know it sucks to not see the scale number moving, but know that your fat is being burned if you’re keeping a deficit! That water is gonna come off soon, since there’s less fat to hold it in! The scale number is gonna move in time!

,loseit,"Hello, 26F here, I recently got my blood work done.
My cholesterol is 220.
LDL- 145.6
HDL-59.7
Triglycerides-91.5

 I am wondering what exactly in my diet is effecting it.
I am overweight. I am losing weight. Down from 216 to 167lb.
I have 2 eggs daily. I reach my daily limit of cholesterol automatically, so everything is an add on and hence a higher value.
Milk, I have around 0.5 cup daily.
Bread, I usually eat whole wheat bread and sometimes whit too. Not more than 2 slices daily. I did add butter to it, 1 tsp.
I don't eat that much of biscuits, cakes. It's an indulgence that I'll also need to cut, including pizza😭 

I do have fried foods in my diet. But they are made in veg oil. Isn't cholesterol effected by trans and saturated fat? Isn't veg oil none of the above? I am extremely confused here.
Most of the oil I use in cooking is olive oil.

So if reduce my daily egg intake, cut out butter, mayo, cheese, milk, potato. It's should work. The fried food and thing is something I need help with. 

I am a bit scared because I don't wanna die. I am hoping once i am in the ideal weight range, that should help. I have been obese for so long. This is the first time in approx 8 years that I have been in the overweight category. I am hoping to go lower in a few month.

I am hoping these changes will ofcourse help the weight loss too.

My cholesterol is 220.
LDL- 145.6
HDL-59.7
Triglycerides-91.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am wondering what exactly in my diet is effecting it.
I am overweight. I am losing weight. Down from 216 to 167lb.
I have 2 eggs daily. I reach my daily limit of cholesterol automatically, so everything is an add on and hence a higher value.
Milk, I have around 0.5 cup daily.
Bread, I usually eat whole wheat bread and sometimes whit too. Not more than 2 slices daily. I did add butter to it, 1 tsp.
I don&amp;#39;t eat that much of biscuits, cakes. It&amp;#39;s an indulgence that I&amp;#39;ll also need to cut, including pizza😭 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have fried foods in my diet. But they are made in veg oil. Isn&amp;#39;t cholesterol effected by trans and saturated fat? Isn&amp;#39;t veg oil none of the above? I am extremely confused here.
Most of the oil I use in cooking is olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if reduce my daily egg intake, cut out butter, mayo, cheese, milk, potato. It&amp;#39;s should work. The fried food and thing is something I need help with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a bit scared because I don&amp;#39;t wanna die. I am hoping once i am in the ideal weight range, that should help. I have been obese for so long. This is the first time in approx 8 years that I have been in the overweight category. I am hoping to go lower in a few month.&lt;/p&gt;

As a short woman in my 50s this is not a good place, so I downloaded loseit and set a step goal and was kind of embarrassed to find that eating less calories than you burn well, you know. I set a goal of 160 and as of today I'm at 175, feel a million times better, don't feel deprived, and feel this is sustainable. 

Howsomever - the scale I used at the start is an old school type dial scale that might be almost as old as I am, and I think it's about 3-5 pounds off - i.e, I probably started at 213 and am now 180. I've got a digital scale now and comparing weight on the two I think my old monster is accurate enough when it comes to pounds lost (or gained) - If I'm down a pound or two on one I'm done a pound or two on the another. Eventually I'd like to have an accurate measurement, and I know I could just reset my goal using the digital weight - but I just have this thing about using the same scale at least to get to my first goal of ""160 which is really 165,"", and then for subsequent smaller goals (I'd like to get to 145 eventually) just go ahead and reset and use the digital then - it won't bug me to go ""up"" 5 lbs.

,loseit,"So all my adult life I have struggled with my weight.  I love to eat and I hate really doing a lot of working out.  I did get down at one point 7 years ago to 180 but have been going back up ever since.  The last four months have been a text book in inactivity.  The weather was cold, rained and snowed a lot, I fell into deep depression.  I spent my time eating junk and reading comics and playing video games and using every excuse in the world I could find not to exercise.  it has effected my physical health as well as my mental health.  I was talking to my therapist and she asked me why if I took such steps towards improving my metal health why I did nothing for my physical health.  I sat long and hard and the only answer I could think of was because I am lazy.  I have no physical condition that will keep me from working out other then being overweight and getting tired.  I decided that ends as of now.

I talked to my primary care doctor and we had a long appointment where we came up with some things do to to help me stay active.  One thing when I am feeling upset I pace.  So he said i need to turn that into walking.  He said if I start small with things that I dont hate like the walking that will be a good start.  He also talked about a little light jogging.  We then talked about my diet and I wont even get into that.  but we found some healthy foods and meals plans that I am comftable with.  

I have a large area in my yard that I can walk  laps in and the ground is even so I can do some jogging also.  I have a hard time leaving the house and being in public so parks are not the greatest for me.  I also have an area on my back porch for Jumping Jacks.  My mother is also helping.  She got me a fit bit to keep track of my walking.  I am also going to drink water of soda and sugar drinks and thanks to the fit bit app can keep track of how much I drink.  I set a goal of how much I want to walk each day.  I loaded my mp3 player with tons of music to listen to.  my mother is also going to call me several times a day to make sure I am not being lazy.  I have a set time that I will not be playing video games.  Like I said no games between 9am and 6pm and I put a limit on how many comics I can read a day.  On rainy days I can walk in my house.  I live in a trailer so there is a pretty straight shot that I can walk back and forth in.  Just really anything to keep me out of my room and off my butt.

As of today 3-6-21 I weigh 301 pounds.  I have not set a target weight as I do not want to be disappointed if I do not get to it.  

I know this will be hard because I really love just being lazy, playing games, reading comics and watching tv.  

Does anyone maybe have any advice on how to stay motivated?  Like how did you go from lazy to active?

I love to eat and I hate really doing a lot of working out.  I did get down at one point 7 years ago to 180 but have been going back up ever since.  The last four months have been a text book in inactivity.  The weather was cold, rained and snowed a lot, I fell into deep depression.  I spent my time eating junk and reading comics and playing video games and using every excuse in the world I could find not to exercise.  it has effected my physical health as well as my mental health.  I was talking to my therapist and she asked me why if I took such steps towards improving my metal health why I did nothing for my physical health.  I sat long and hard and the only answer I could think of was because I am lazy.  I have no physical condition that will keep me from working out other then being overweight and getting tired.  I decided that ends as of now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to my primary care doctor and we had a long appointment where we came up with some things do to to help me stay active.  One thing when I am feeling upset I pace.  So he said i need to turn that into walking.  He said if I start small with things that I dont hate like the walking that will be a good start.  He also talked about a little light jogging.  We then talked about my diet and I wont even get into that.  but we found some healthy foods and meals plans that I am comftable with.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a large area in my yard that I can walk  laps in and the ground is even so I can do some jogging also.  I have a hard time leaving the house and being in public so parks are not the greatest for me.  I also have an area on my back porch for Jumping Jacks.  My mother is also helping.  She got me a fit bit to keep track of my walking.  I am also going to drink water of soda and sugar drinks and thanks to the fit bit app can keep track of how much I drink.  I set a goal of how much I want to walk each day.  I loaded my mp3 player with tons of music to listen to.  my mother is also going to call me several times a day to make sure I am not being lazy.  I have a set time that I will not be playing video games.  Like I said no games between 9am and 6pm and I put a limit on how many comics I can read a day.  On rainy days I can walk in my house.  I live in a trailer so there is a pretty straight shot that I can walk back and forth in.  Just really anything to keep me out of my room and off my butt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today 3-6-21 I weigh 301 pounds.  I have not set a target weight as I do not want to be disappointed if I do not get to it.  &lt;/p&gt;

One that tracks the day of the week, and the total days in the cycle (this particular sheet is a 12 week sheet). The next totals the calories for the day, and then averages the calories for that week.

When you eat something, just put the calories in the next 'Food' column for that day, and it will automatically add it to your total for that day, as well as calculate its number into your average for the week. If you weigh yourself every day, put that into the 'Current Weight' column, and it will average your weight for the week. This is to give more of an overall weight trend as opposed to once a week weighing, which can fluctuate a bit much.

Because weight loss is a long process, people (myself included) can get lost in the minutia of the day to day. Using the spreadsheet has really helped me to put things into big picture perspective. And because it's helping me, I figured maybe it might help someone else, so I made a blank copy to share with you guys. If you want to make a copy, just go to File, and then 'Make a Copy'.

Whether it comes from disgust with yourself, fear of health effects, or motivation from posters here who lost massive amounts in relatively short amounts of time. 

If you've been around here and read along a bit, you probably have some numbers or phrases memorized. 

-For the average overweight/obese person, you should lose no more than two pounds per week. 

-Women need a minimum of 1200 calories per day. 

-Men need a minimum of 1500 calories per day. 

-You probably shouldn't eat back your exercise calories, at least not all of them. 

If you go too hard and post about losing 5lbs a week or declare a dry fast or eating 1000 calories a day, you'll probably get some push back. 

I'm here to push back about the other half of this mindset, from my point of view as a relatively short woman who had a medium amount of weight to lose. I have tried to lose multiple times, with the help of this subreddit and /r/1200isplenty. 

1200 isn't plenty or sustainable for every woman, and if you're reading this and getting defensive... It may be enough for you. But if you're constantly hungry, thinking about food, your hair is thinning..those are classic signs you're under fueling. 

But what is even sneakier is what's more likely: while under fueling you'll probably snap one day and slip and eat 2400 calories or more. Maybe it turns into multiple days or even weeks of falling off the wagon. You blame yourself for not being able to stay consistent, for not being strong like the women you seeing constantly eating under 1300 calories. 

If you are moderately active and not super short, you probably need more than 1200 calories. ""But wait!"" you say, ""I need a 1000 calorie daily deficit to lose 2 lbs a week, so I have to eat 1250 or less because I'm working from home!""

Have you considered you don't need to lose 2 lbs a week? 

Just because it's the maximum, the fastest possible, doesn't mean it's on your path. Just because 1200 calories is the minimum doesn't mean you need to do that. 

I've had a lot more success eating 1700-2000 calories a day than 1200-1400, and I have more energy and focus. I also will add that I *am* eating exercise calories back (I need to, I'm running 35 miles a week)! It takes a lot of patience, but I know I've more permanently lost this weight this time.

&lt;p&gt;If you go too hard and post about losing 5lbs a week or declare a dry fast or eating 1000 calories a day, you&amp;#39;ll probably get some push back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m here to push back about the other half of this mindset, from my point of view as a relatively short woman who had a medium amount of weight to lose. I have tried to lose multiple times, with the help of this subreddit and &lt;a href=""/r/1200isplenty""&gt;/r/1200isplenty&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1200 isn&amp;#39;t plenty or sustainable for every woman, and if you&amp;#39;re reading this and getting defensive... It may be enough for you. But if you&amp;#39;re constantly hungry, thinking about food, your hair is thinning..those are classic signs you&amp;#39;re under fueling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is even sneakier is what&amp;#39;s more likely: while under fueling you&amp;#39;ll probably snap one day and slip and eat 2400 calories or more. Maybe it turns into multiple days or even weeks of falling off the wagon. You blame yourself for not being able to stay consistent, for not being strong like the women you seeing constantly eating under 1300 calories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are moderately active and not super short, you probably need more than 1200 calories. &amp;quot;But wait!&amp;quot; you say, &amp;quot;I need a 1000 calorie daily deficit to lose 2 lbs a week, so I have to eat 1250 or less because I&amp;#39;m working from home!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you considered you don&amp;#39;t need to lose 2 lbs a week? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because it&amp;#39;s the maximum, the fastest possible, doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s on your path. Just because 1200 calories is the minimum doesn&amp;#39;t mean you need to do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a lot more success eating 1700-2000 calories a day than 1200-1400, and I have more energy and focus. I also will add that I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; eating exercise calories back (I need to, I&amp;#39;m running 35 miles a week)! It takes a lot of patience, but I know I&amp;#39;ve more permanently lost this weight this time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reconsider your relationship with that 2lb a week goal. See if it&amp;#39;s right for you!&lt;/p&gt;

I started at 283lbs and now sit at 277lbs, ok granted the first 5lbs I always consider water weight , so maybe I have lost only 1lb of fat , but hey its a start at least.

As my regular diet has gotten healthier over the years, there’s a few things I started eating for weight loss that I now love:

1. Turkey. Bacon.
Turkey bacon is delicious. It’s not quite as good as the real thing at first, but it’s crispy and meaty and tasty with only 30 calories a slice and less heart disease. Amazing. I’ll have real bacon sometimes if I go to a diner and it’s good, but I love me some turkey bacon.

2. Cauliflower
It’s basic, but there’s a reason it’s so popular and it’s so tasty and easy to add a little veggie into everything and it adds low calories bulk. Amazing.

3. Nonfat Greek Yogurt
I’ve only added this a few times, but it adds such a high protein low calorie creamy quality to things. I don’t know why I don’t buy it more, but every time I use it *chefs kiss*

4. Black coffee
It took me awhile but I love black coffee, especially with hazelnut

,loseit,"Hi everyone!

I am a chronic lurker but this sub has really been helpful during the last year. I have been overweight my entire life, compounded with being tall which always gives a complex about being a ""big girl"". In middle school we moved and I really blew up at that point due to depression and anxiety, with my primary coping skill being comfort eating.

When I was a teen I was sent to an outdoors program for almost 2 years. I went in weighing 315 at age 16 and came out at 215 at age 18. However, I immediately started gaining weight the minute I had choices of intake. My heaviest that I actually weighed myself at was 404 pounds in 2015. In 2019, I had a herniated disc that spilled into my spinal canal and compressed the nerve bundle at the end of my spine, paralyzing me from the waist down. My first weigh in after a few years put me at 390 in the hospital. I wish I could say I started making changes then, but that wasn't the case. Luckily, I've regained my ability to walk and am very mobile again.

When COVID hit, I was sitting at home doing my usual binging on take out. One day, I was eating some peanut butter oreos, and polished off the pack during the day. This wasn't anything out of the ordinary or even that much. But somehow, something clicked that day. I thought, ""I can't go on like this, and what do I want to look back at this pandemic time and say I did?"" So I committed to using the Loseit app again.

I'd been on diets since age 11 and I would always go hard for about a month and then slip back to old habits. I never created anything I could sustain. This time, I implemented small changes, a few at a time. The biggest difference was that I started eating healthier. I always just did portion/calorie control but still with junk. I do restricted time windows for eating (11 am - 7 pm), low calorie, macronutrients balance of at least 30% protein and under 100g net carbs, logging EVERYTHING before I put it in my mouth, fiber/sodium monitoring, and very limited sugar. I haven't been perfect and that's ok, but the most foundational piece has been to log no matter what. I have to look at it, whether I have a bad day and eat a ton of pizza, or a good day when I eat super healthy.

At first I was waiting to inevitably fail again, but eventually I realized I have really been able to turn a corner and stay consistent. I'm excited to keep going and reach my final goal. It feels possible and this time is different. I've already been thinking about how to do maintenance successfully and have some plans for that.

&lt;p&gt;I am a chronic lurker but this sub has really been helpful during the last year. I have been overweight my entire life, compounded with being tall which always gives a complex about being a &amp;quot;big girl&amp;quot;. In middle school we moved and I really blew up at that point due to depression and anxiety, with my primary coping skill being comfort eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a teen I was sent to an outdoors program for almost 2 years. I went in weighing 315 at age 16 and came out at 215 at age 18. However, I immediately started gaining weight the minute I had choices of intake. My heaviest that I actually weighed myself at was 404 pounds in 2015. In 2019, I had a herniated disc that spilled into my spinal canal and compressed the nerve bundle at the end of my spine, paralyzing me from the waist down. My first weigh in after a few years put me at 390 in the hospital. I wish I could say I started making changes then, but that wasn&amp;#39;t the case. Luckily, I&amp;#39;ve regained my ability to walk and am very mobile again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When COVID hit, I was sitting at home doing my usual binging on take out. One day, I was eating some peanut butter oreos, and polished off the pack during the day. This wasn&amp;#39;t anything out of the ordinary or even that much. But somehow, something clicked that day. I thought, &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t go on like this, and what do I want to look back at this pandemic time and say I did?&amp;quot; So I committed to using the Loseit app again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been on diets since age 11 and I would always go hard for about a month and then slip back to old habits. I never created anything I could sustain.

,loseit,"First post ever! Apologies in advance for the “TLDR” material. 

Let me start by saying I am so happy to have found this corner of the internet. Whenever I’ve gone through tough times in my life, finding a community that somehow understands my struggles has played a huge role in my recovery.

A little bit of background about me, I’m a Female, 31 years old, 5’3. SW: 170 CW: 158 GW:120.

Like a lot of you, I’ve been dealing with being overweight/obese for most of my life. I hit my highest weight when I was 15, at ~210 pounds. 

Coming from a family of slim beautiful girls, and living in a culture where looks are everything, this certainly made me feel “less worthy”. It was back then when I first decided I wanted to change my life.

By the time I turned 16 I had managed to lose 60 pounds. I did this with the help of a professional who taught me about calories, nutrients, metabolism, and helped me find healthy replacements for my then poor food choices.

Here’s when things started to derail. You see, naturally, I hit a plateau at this point. And though I’d lost a ton of weight and was healthier than ever, I never really had any other motivation for losing weight than to “be skinny and beautiful”

At 150lbs I still hated my body, maybe even more now that I was getting stretch marks all over me. I wanted to push this Plateau so badly that I started overworking and over restricting myself, which eventually led to me quitting, convincing myself that I was “never gonna be beautiful, so might as well stop being miserable and make myself happy with what I loved the most: food”

Lucky for me, I didn’t gain all the weight back, but I did gain some, and after seeing a trend and getting really worried, I went to a new professional. This time around I became literally obsessed with losing weight, to the point of not following my doctor’s meal plan because I thought it had “too many calories”. I lost weight alright, I went down to 114lbs -my lowest ever. But as you can guess, I couldn’t keep it off.

This was a tumultuous time. I was depressed, engaged in self destructing behavior, and eventually (at 19) I diagnosed with Disordered Eating and BPD. 

After my mental recovery, I gained a lot of weight again. This was almost unavoidable due to some of the medication I was taking and other circumstances. I think I had hit ~185lbs when I realized I had to get it together or this would backtrack all my personal progress and send me back into a depressive episode. 

That time around I lost the weight in a more healthy way, and I managed to remain in an “OK” weight (~140lbs) for a few years. 

But of course, life happens: Marriage, Office Job, Devastating Hip Arthritis Diagnosis followed by a very unsuccessful, traumatizing, painful and life changing surgery from which I never recovered fully and that left me using a cane to walk. Then divorce. 

*Trigger Warning*

As a depressive person, I honestly don’t know how I managed to not kill myself during this time. Losing my hip, then my husband, living alone in another country and struggling to walk from my bed to my bathroom in my very very tiny apartment. 

But I pulled through like never before. Maybe it was the years of therapy, maybe I just had no other choice. And eventually I met the love of my life, I landed the job of my dreams, and had a beautiful and healthy daughter.

I finally found a GOOD reason why I want to lose weight: I want to be healthier. I want to reduce the pain on my legs so I can play with my kid, live a better life, and stay strong. My disease is chronic and degenerative, so If I don’t do this, I’ll probably wont walk at all by the time I’m 50. 

The 12 pounds I’ve lost so far have already made such a huge difference in my mobility. Not to mention my energy levels! 

I’m sad that I had to go through all of this but happy I finally understood that we really need to treat our bodies better because we only have one life. And that my goals should be oriented towards that: a healthy and well nourished body. 

I guess the saying is true, you never know what you have until you lose it! Now that my body is a lot more fragile I really see the importance of taking care of myself! And this has made my weight-loss almost effortless because I feel happy and proud of treating my body the right way.

And the added bonus: teaching my child healthy habits so that she doesn’t have to suffer later on in life like I did.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll just add that my wife is pretty normal. She likes the usual Friday takeout after a long week of working in the office, but it&amp;#39;s a huge trigger for me. Her cravings trigger my cravings and it feels like an endless cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

Stay within calorie range (1800): Doing okay here. More maintenance days than I like if I’m going to keep up the 3-4 pounds down a month but still better than a previous version of myself. 2/2 days.

Exercise 5 days a week: 30-minute brisk walk at lunch. 5/5 days.

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, nonfood rewards): Gonna have an easy evening in &amp; chill.

Try a new recipe once a week: Romanesco, roasted. New veggie, new recipe, I say it counts even though it tasted like a fun broccoli cauliflower love child. 1/4 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to** r/Loseit!

&amp;#x200B;

So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why you’re overweight

&amp;#x200B;

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before You Start

&amp;#x200B;

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tracking

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

&amp;#x200B;

# Creating Your Deficit

&amp;#x200B;

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Exercise

&amp;#x200B;

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Crawl, Walk, Run

&amp;#x200B;

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Acceptance

&amp;#x200B;

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.

We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.&lt;/p&gt;

TW: disordered eating, also I am in no way encouraging eating the way I did, just giving you my story and seeking advice.

This year so far has unfortunately been a tough one for me in terms of food. When I was overweight I struggled with binge eating (wasn’t diagnosed) and it got to the point where I was doing it almost everyday. Fast forward to September 2020 and I started practicing portion control. Towards the end of October I got started CICO with a combo of intermittent fasting. It ended up working out great obviously and I finally start to lose weight and had not binged since before I started losing, there were a few days I overate but they couldn’t compare to how I was eating before.

Since I got down to around 132 I had been feeling slightly hungrier even though I’d been eating around 1400 calories since the beginning of my journey. I started getting a little impatient because I’ve been sedentary for the most part and knew I needed to create a bigger deficit because I wasn’t burning as much as before. So I did that and it was going okay until recently.

About a week ago I was PMSing and I had cravings so I had a few maintenance days to combat this problem and it normally works out okay. Well this time I overate 2 days in a row and ended with a binge on the last day, which was at least 4000+ calories (I didn’t count). I ate past the point of being sick (although somehow I didn’t throw up) and afterwards I was in so much pain that I literally thought my stomach was going to burst. I hadn’t eaten like that in so long and I’m not that big of a person so I suffered in the days that followed. When I stepped on the scale the next morning I weighed 137 and I panicked. So I restricted the next 4 days and ate under 1000 calories. I know it’s not okay to eat this much or little but I wasn’t really thinking straight and wanted to get back down to my original weight quickly. It worked and I got back down to 132 so I decided I would eat 1200 and have one maintenance day of 1600 per week. 

Yesterday I ate 2000 instead of 1600 for my maintenance day and today I ate my actual maintenance rather than going back down to 1200. The kicker is I’m still hungry (yay!). I know some of you will say “1200 isn’t enough! Your young and that’s what a toddler needs, blah, blah, blah.” Please don’t tell me this. I am a short person with a low TDEE and even with extra walking I can’t eat a lot. I also don’t do high intensity exercise because it increases my hunger. I am waiting to start doing more workouts once I hit my goal range so I can eat an adequate amount. 

So that’s what’s happened so far and I’m just struggling. Ever since I’ve got to the low 130s my hunger has been out of control. I just have a strong desire to eat and I don’t even remember how I did it the rest of the time when I was in a deficit. I’ve heard a bit about having a “set point” in terms of weight and I think 134 may be mine. The lowest weight I can remember weighing at this height was 134 and then I went up from there. No matter what it seems like I can’t get past 130 and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried eating at different times of the day from 5 meals to 2 meals (I think 2 works best) but it isn’t helping anymore. I already also practice volume eating and I make sure to eat enough protein, so I’m just like: what else can I do?!?

My last solution is to take a maintenance break for about 2 weeks and then slowly go down by 50 calories each week until I reach 1300. I’ve taken maintenance breaks before and I was going to do so at 130 but I guess I’m going to start it now.

- Current weight: 284.6
- Weight lost: 25.4
- Goal weight: 137
- Left to go: 147.6

Today I hit my first milestone which was -25 lbs. 

I started at Christmas when my sister got engaged. She’s in the Air Force Academy and can’t get married until she graduates in 2024 so that’s more than enough time for me to lose all my weight, so it motivated me to get started.

First I started by only eating lean cuisines and tracking all my calories in My Fitness Pal. Yes I know OMG THE SODIUM. You know what else has lots of sodium? Getting fast food 3 times a day. I had to start somewhere. I did it to relearn portion sizes. I was never really a snacker I was just eating huge meals. I started eating 3 lean cuisines plus having 3 healthy snacks throughout the day.

Then as time went on I slowly started phasing out the lean cuisines. I still haven’t weaned off them completely, I still have a few per week. I have a lot to learn with cooking and meal prep. But I’m doing well so far.

Currently I am eating 1300 calories a day and not doing much exercise. I go to an aqua fit class 2 times per week. I’m trying to get out and walk my dog more but I’ve been bad about it.

As far as a reward for hitting this milestone goes.. I know rewarding with food is frowned upon but there’s not any material thing I want so my husband and I were trying to think of more “experience” type rewards. That’s hard right now with covid. So we settled on getting really good quality sushi and getting a bunch of random things we’ve never tried before. 

My next milestone is 270 which is 14.6 pounds down from where I’m at now. My happy scale app predicts I’ll hit that on June 16. But they also predicted I’d hit this milestone on April 9 which was over a month off so hopefully I can beat the June 16 deadline!",t2_4m134eix,False,,0,False,I hit milestone 1/12!!!,[],r/loseit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lyg05m,False,dark,0.92,,public,43,2,{},67c24d52-c3a4-11e5-a551-0e30909a2135,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,43,,False,,False,blank,[],{},,True,,1614991595.0,text,6,,,text,self.loseit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I hit my first milestone which was -25 lbs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started at Christmas when my sister got engaged. She’s in the Air Force Academy and can’t get married until she graduates in 2024 so that’s more than enough time for me to lose all my weight, so it motivated me to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I started by only eating lean cuisines and tracking all my calories in My Fitness Pal. Yes I know OMG THE SODIUM. You know what else has lots of sodium? Getting fast food 3 times a day. I had to start somewhere. I did it to relearn portion sizes. I was never really a snacker I was just eating huge meals. I started eating 3 lean cuisines plus having 3 healthy snacks throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then as time went on I slowly started phasing out the lean cuisines. I still haven’t weaned off them completely, I still have a few per week. I have a lot to learn with cooking and meal prep. But I’m doing well so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I am eating 1300 calories a day and not doing much exercise. I go to an aqua fit class 2 times per week. I’m trying to get out and walk my dog more but I’ve been bad about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as a reward for hitting this milestone goes.. I know rewarding with food is frowned upon but there’s not any material thing I want so my husband and I were trying to think of more “experience” type rewards. That’s hard right now with covid. So we settled on getting really good quality sushi and getting a bunch of random things we’ve never tried before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next milestone is 270 which is 14.6 pounds down from where I’m at now. My happy scale app predicts I’ll hit that on June 16. But they also predicted I’d hit this milestone on April 9 which was over a month off so hopefully I can beat the June 16 deadline!&lt;/p&gt;

I started the previous weight-loosing cycle November 2018 with a starting weight of 195 lbs (female, 5'6'').

,loseit,"Hello all, and Happy Friday! First off, I want to thank everyone in this community - I've been around off and on \~5 years, and this really is such an uplifting and inspiring community. 

So, I want to share some struggles I've had recently, in the hope that it will be cathartic for me, and also hopefully will help others who are also struggling. 

Current stats: 30F, 5'6"", HW:175lb, SW: 168lb, CW: 143lb, GW: 130lb (reached in January 2021...not there currently)

Background: I've struggled with being overweight since my early teens. I started gaining around age 11-12 or so, and by the time I was 15, I weighed 175. At the time, my mom went on a low carb diet and began losing weight. I followed something similar, but not strictly low carb, just less food in general, but still ate some carbs and junk food. Tried to move more, etc. By the time I was 16, I was about 145lb or so, and pretty happy with that. By the time I was 18, I had gotten to \~132 without trying - I think having active jobs helped. At age 18, there were a lot of changes in my life: moved out, started university, started drinking, and started a toxic relationship. That all results in a slow gain over the next few years, and although there were MANY attempts to lose weight, none of them really stuck. The combo of the relationship, stress and drinking did not do me any favors. 

Beginning of 2013, age 23, I was 160 pounds, and just starting a new relationship. I quickly gained 15 pounds in \~9 months or so due to eating a bit more junk and bigger portion sizes (the new bf is very active and eats OMAD...so I shouldn't be eating anywhere close to what he does.) At that point, I had reached my HW of 175 again, and I realized I needed to make a change, and started losing (I was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic based on A1C, so that gave me a concrete health reason to lose weight.) From 2014-2019, I cycled from 143-165 several times, each time not quite getting to my goal of 130. I learned valuable things with each cycle - for example, I dropped breakfast a long time ago, and almost never eat it now (I eat more through the day when I do eat breakfast.) I realized low carb is not for me, and I can't sustain it forever, so it's better to for me to just calorie count. However, I also need to focus on healthier foods overall for sustainability and health. Thankfully, my A1C has been in the normal range every time I've had it checked since 2014. 

Cue to June 2019 - back at 168lb, and I knew I had to do something about it. I read something here on loseit that really helped me change my perspective. ""Don't let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway."" From then on I decided I had to make small, slow, SUSTAINABLE (i.e., lifestyle) changes, or I would keep on weight cycling forever. I started just counting calories again and aiming for some type of workout 2x per week. From there, I slowly continued to add things, adjust, etc., not focusing on how long it would take at all. Focusing on sustainable habits, consistency and patience. From June 2019 to December 2020, I went from 168 to 132 pounds, which is close to 0.5lb/week. 

Mid-December 2020: I quit smoking weed due to a possible new job (I started smoking in 2013, which has helped reduce drinking drastically since then. There is some willpower initially to not give in to munchies.) From there, I lost weight pretty quickly, and saw my GW of 130 on January 2, 2021. At this point, I was toying with whether or not I should go to 125, and then try to gain muscle. On January 14th (after seeing 129 a couple times!) I decided, this is it, I should try to focus on maintenance for now. That same day, I got rejected for the job I was applying for. Cue weed smoking again that evening. I decided to eat some of the christmas chocolates we had around (I really didn't indulge much over christmas due to not having much of an appetite.) That was all fine, I logged everything, and didn't go crazy. Two days later, on January 16th, we found out that our dog had cancer. Literally, one of my best friends, and my baby...I'm getting teary eyed just typing this out. We were in shock, and not sure how much longer we'd have with her. This is when healthy habits just started getting thrown out the window - no calorie counting, no workouts. I had to spend as much time with her as possible. The next day, we decided we had to put her down sooner than later due to some difficulty she was having with walking (the tumor was growing very quickly.) We called the next morning, and scheduled her appt for later that day. Since then, my ass has been kicked in trying to deal with the grief of losing her. Long story short, I'm back up to 143 pounds about 6 weeks later, which is not good. I do not want all of my progress to be undone. I've managed to mostly keep up with workouts, which is good. Food has been a struggle though. I definitely am an emotional eater, and I'm really trying to find ways to deal with the emotions better. Working out does help, but at night when I miss her...emotional eating can easily undo all of the hard work of working out. I committed again yesterday to log everything, no matter what. I had tried to restart logging several times, but just struggled with it. I'm in a little better place now...still missing her terribly, but I know that I will regret it if I don't course-correct now. 

I just needed to get this off my chest, and I appreciate every single person who took the time to read this. You can only do your best, and your best looks different every day.

So, in February 2020 I've reached my lowest weight ever, which was 59 kg (130 lbs) and I was absolutely overjoyed, as I've been working on getting to that point for over 3 months. And then COVID struck and I left my uni city to spend lockdown with my parents aaaaand... well, started gaining weight.

Just to be clear: although I was fit, I was also quite unhealthy. I was cold all the damn time, I couldn't stop thinking about food, I lost my period (and got it back after over half a year). So when lockdown started and eventually lasted for more than expected 2 weeks, I started bingeing. Regularly.

In summer I weighed myself for the first time since February, because I was too scared to see how much exactly I've put on. And well, I weighed 78 kg (172 lbs). I, of course, decided that I needed to lose it all back again, especially since the pandemic supposedly was coming to an end in my country and I just couldn't look at myself in the mirror. Unsurprisingly, I failed and not only did not *lose* any weight, I actually started eating absolutely *massive* amounts of food, mostly because I was living alone at the time and felt no pressure, since the second lockdown started and I've only hung out with friend over zoom etc. Looking back now, I have no idea how I could stuff myself so much. It's like a different lifetime.

Anyways, I again moved back to my parents and I thought, ""well, it's now or never, let's just do it"". Sadly, I just couldn't get motivated. Like, at all. Fortunately, since I now actually lived with people, I worked on my ridiculous eating habits and now, after 3 months, I can say I eat fairly healthy.

BUT I have not weighed myself since summer, simply because I was too scared to see how much more I've put on. But today I woke up and felt good about it and made use of my scale. I officially weigh the most I've ever had in my entire life, which is 81 kg (178 lbs). I'm not mortified. I'm not angry. I'm just tired of living in this weird and ungracious body and I miss my lovely clothes. I feel like I finally got the kick in the butt that I've so desperately needed.

,loseit,"I just discovered this community (is that what it’s called?) and I’m hoping it will give me the motivation I need and help me find some answers :/

I’m a 20 year old female. I’ve been overweight almost my entire life. My highest weight is 222.8 pounds (I’m 5’6) and I’ve gotten down to 198.4 since September.

Ive tried to lose weight numerous times. In high school, I struggled with anorexia for about a year and lost about 50 pounds in 2 months. I got down to my lowest weight, which was 145 pounds. Due to stress and depression, I eventually started showing signs of binge eating disorder and ate my way up to 222lbs.

Another important part of my story is that I have had rheumatoid arthritis since I was 4 years. It is hard for me to be in my feet for more than 2 or 3 hours. I have limited mobility in my ankles, which makes it hard for me to run and do certain exercises. I try my best to workout and get in as many steps as I can, but I have promised myself that I will not push my body too far in terms of my arthritis.

So flash forward to today. I have lost almost 25 pounds, which sounds pretty good. But it has taken me 6 months. 

When I lost those 25 pounds, I was not exercising. I was on a strict 1200-1300 calorie “diet”- I know now that this was NOT healthy!!! I was dropping weight so fast, but eventually I would binge, which lead me to eating whatever I wanted for 2-3 weeks.

I take full accountability. I know I should have stuck with it, but I didn’t. I promised myself I would not give up this time, so every time I failed, I eventually picked myself back up.

But ever since the start of the new year, I have been having so much trouble losing weight. I have barely lost a thing. Maybe 5 pounds at most.

In January I ate about 1300-1400 calories a day. No exercise. Didn’t lose anything. I took a week off and ate whatever I wanted to try to reset my metabolism. Started dieting again, weighed in and lost 4 pounds. The next week I weighed in and lost absolutely nothing. Not even an ounce.

So I took a week off again and ate whatever I wanted then started the diet again. I started to exercise and ate about 1500 calories. Like I said, I don’t get many steps in due to my arthritis, but I was burning enough calories through exercise to get me down to 1200 calories per day.

I have been doing that since mid February, and have barely seen results.

I weighed in last week and only lost .4 pounds.

Today I looked down at my stomach to see new stretch marks. I broke down into tears? How?!? Why?!? I know for a fact I have not gained. It is just not possible. There is no way. 

What am I doing wrong?

Is it possible that I am losing weight but gaining enough muscle each week to balance it out... since I’m new to working out?

I just feel so discouraged. I’ve been working so hard. Should I exercise more? And burn more calories?

I drink almost a gallon of water a day!!

I just want to give up. I know I can’t. But I want to.

I take measurements, and I lost 4 inches last week, but I’ve convinced myself that it’s because I didn’t measure in the exact same spot that I did the week before. 

I don’t look any different. I don’t look like I’ve lost weight within the last month or so.

What’s wrong with me? Does anyone have advice or insight? Their own experience? Help, please. I just don’t know what to do. I am so tired of living like this, and I just want to be healthy and confident for once in my lifetime.",t2_8dgxms5y,False,,0,False,"I promised myself I wouldn’t give up, but I’m so discouraged.",[],r/loseit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lyvzl0,False,dark,0.75,,public,2,0,{},52a4dae2-6c35-11e9-81f1-0acf30770a48,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,1615013256.0,noflair,[],{},,True,,1615041851.0,text,6,,,text,self.loseit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just discovered this community (is that what it’s called?) and I’m hoping it will give me the motivation I need and help me find some answers :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a 20 year old female. I’ve been overweight almost my entire life. My highest weight is 222.8 pounds (I’m 5’6) and I’ve gotten down to 198.4 since September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive tried to lose weight numerous times. In high school, I struggled with anorexia for about a year and lost about 50 pounds in 2 months. I got down to my lowest weight, which was 145 pounds. Due to stress and depression, I eventually started showing signs of binge eating disorder and ate my way up to 222lbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important part of my story is that I have had rheumatoid arthritis since I was 4 years. It is hard for me to be in my feet for more than 2 or 3 hours. I have limited mobility in my ankles, which makes it hard for me to run and do certain exercises. I try my best to workout and get in as many steps as I can, but I have promised myself that I will not push my body too far in terms of my arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So flash forward to today. I have lost almost 25 pounds, which sounds pretty good. But it has taken me 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I lost those 25 pounds, I was not exercising. I was on a strict 1200-1300 calorie “diet”- I know now that this was NOT healthy!!! I was dropping weight so fast, but eventually I would binge, which lead me to eating whatever I wanted for 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take full accountability. I know I should have stuck with it, but I didn’t. I promised myself I would not give up this time, so every time I failed, I eventually picked myself back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ever since the start of the new year, I have been having so much trouble losing weight. I have barely lost a thing. Maybe 5 pounds at most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January I ate about 1300-1400 calories a day. No exercise. Didn’t lose anything. I took a week off and ate whatever I wanted to try to reset my metabolism. Started dieting again, weighed in and lost 4 pounds. The next week I weighed in and lost absolutely nothing. Not even an ounce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took a week off again and ate whatever I wanted then started the diet again. I started to exercise and ate about 1500 calories. Like I said, I don’t get many steps in due to my arthritis, but I was burning enough calories through exercise to get me down to 1200 calories per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been doing that since mid February, and have barely seen results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I weighed in last week and only lost .4 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I looked down at my stomach to see new stretch marks. I broke down into tears? How?!? Why?!? I know for a fact I have not gained. It is just not possible. There is no way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I doing wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that I am losing weight but gaining enough muscle each week to balance it out... since I’m new to working out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel so discouraged. I’ve been working so hard. Should I exercise more? And burn more calories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drink almost a gallon of water a day!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to give up. I know I can’t. But I want to.&lt;/p&gt;

I have lost 40 pounds and I’m on my last 5-10 pounds. I feel like I look too skinny because my face, arms, and legs are very small now, the only issue is The last place my fat wants to leave is my lower back/love handles/lower stomach.

Can I expect to lose fat in those places eventually, or is there a chance it would be unsafe to keep lifting until I can get that fat off?

Also there is a chance I can be struggling with body dysmorphia. If someone can give their opinion that would be great.

All levels of runner are welcome here, from first timers to experienced  marathoners. We welcome someone who just ran for the first time or is just starting couch to 5K ([r/c25k](https://www.reddit.com/r/c25k/)) as eagerly as someone who has thousands of miles of experience.

This post is for sharing your weekly progress or excitement with running. From training you got in this last week, your first run, a virtual race, or a real race, we'd love to hear what you did. Got a running related NSV (non-scale victory), we'd love to hear. Have a question or need advice, we are here to help.

In addition to sharing your progress each week, I ramble on about some topic related to running. This week's topic -- Running and Insulin Sensitivity. I will say before I dive into this material, I'm no scientist. I don't pretend to be an expert here.

I think when people seen the word insulin, they immediately think diabetes. But insulin manages the level of blood sugar in all people -- with or without diabetes. So, how sensitive you are to insulin in your body means you manage your blood sugar levels better with less insulin in your blood stream. At some point a tiny bit of insulin takes care of managing your glucose level. Now decreased insulin sensitivity, mainly as it decreases or is poor to insulin resistance levels, is something that leads to type 2 diabetes. This is the condition where you need more and more insulin to manage your blood sugar. 

# Running and Insulin Sensitivity

The article here is 10 years old, but it's still incredibly relevant today.  

[Exercise and Insulin Sensitivity—Where Do We Stand? You’d Better Run!](https://www.touchendocrinology.com/diabetes/journal-articles/exercise-and-insulin-sensitivity-where-do-we-stand-youd-better-run/)

There's two incredible things that regular running does for you. 

First, it increases your sensitivity after a single session of running. And, after regular running for six weeks, it's nearly twice the increase in sensitivity.  And if you have some insulin resistant condition, there is great evidence that the response is even greater. The only dissenting evidence is that the response is equal to those without any conditions. 

Second, more insulin sensitivity helps you develop lean mass over adipose fat. I can't say this part enough. One of the amazing things that exercise gives you is it unlocks more and more the ability of your body to use calories to build lean mass. Insulin sensitivity tracks to opening those pathways to put on muscle -- but it isn't the whole story. 

# Is Running special in this regard?

Running is the sweet spot here. Any exercise is great for you. It's moderate/vigorous aerobic exercise. Less intense exercise doesn't do as well, and resistance exercise results are uncertain. 

# If you don't use it, you lose it

This is a common joke punchline but it's very true with the benefits of exercise on insulin sensitivity. Regular exercise pays off greatly. But the increase in sensitivity drops away much faster than your fitness. Just two or three days, and your sensitivity drops. Not all the way, and you are always just one run away from those benefits. So, get out there 2-3 times a week -- that's all it takes.",t2_iwwa2,False,,0,False,Running with LoseIt - 3/5/2021 - Running and Insulin Sensitivity,[],r/loseit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lyh48l,False,dark,0.95,,public,15,0,{},eb9d14e0-c3a4-11e5-923d-0e32fdda8d37,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,15,,False,,False,-115lbs,[],{},,True,,1614994380.0,text,6,,,text,self.loseit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a &amp;#39;weekly&amp;#39; post for the runners of LoseIt.

Okay so 45 lbs (20.4 kg) isn't a whole lot compared to lots of you amazing folks, but it definitely shows on someone my height! I was at my heaviest in 2018 and absolutely hated myself. I had always been a tad overweight, but It shocked me how I just kept climbing and climbing.

I recall sitting in my car one night (alone and sad af) eating hella taco bell like I did basically every night, thinking to myself ""I will never, ***never*** change.""

Overall, I'd say I have been actively losing weight strictly for around 1.5 years. The journey has been incredibly slow, but I think that the fact that I have held steadfast on my weight loss through ALL the plateaus I hit, proves to me that I am capable of keeping this up for a *long* time. I am super fuckin proud of my progress and my body.

Awesome things that happened on my weight loss journey:

* I stopped ripping holes into all my jeans and leggings in my thigh area due to chub rub
* I know BMI doesn't mean much but I went from Obese &gt;&gt; Normal
* I lost almost 1/3 of my body weight
* I hit the weight 123.4 (heh)
* I saw my pelvic bones one day. I remember sitting in bed just moving my hips around in awe.
* I had a tendency to buy clothes that were too dang small for me. I started fitting into them!! then they got too big for me :( -- but really :)
* My flatter belly just keeps shocking me every time i look at myself in the mirror or sit down.
* I don't start wheezing when I do random normal shit
* I can see my collarbone
* Every time I lost weight after 140, I would announce to my friends, I'M tHe LoWeST I'Ve BeEn in 12 YeARS!!

Some info about what I do:

* I do CICO and eat 1100-1200 a day. I started with keto though!
* I sort of do OMAD (700-800 cal meals once a day)
* I weigh all my food, ALL OF IT
* I am conscious that the world is not portioning shit for a 5''0 female
* Avoid sugar where possible. Use sugar substitutes
* I didn't do any exercise (regrettably), but I am going to start soon and I have more stamina when I go out walking now for sure.
* I am patient. Plateaus happen.
* Recognize that weight loss is absolutely about lifestyle changes, not dieting.

Kinda weird showing so much of my body to strangers on the internet. Oh well, here you go, strangers!

,loseit,"So I started taking Phentermine for weight loss last week and so far haven't noticed much change on the scales however I have to say my concentration has become much better and I feel much happier going to work every day as I am much less stressed with the work. Today, I decided to not eat and see how long it takes me to become hungry as the drug is primarily to my understanding a stimulant and an appetite suppressant.   I have managed to get to 6pm without a meal quite comfortably (plenty of water) but I am considering eating something soon.  I am tempted to try  intermittent fasting on weekends. So my questions is has anyone had success intermittent fasting with phentermine and also did your ability to concentrate change?

Edit 7/3/21: 
Thanks for the replies, I see a lot of cautions and so I would like to elaborate on my situation. I am currently tracking and adapting my eating habits to increase my protein, fibrous carbohydrates, some additional fat and largely reduce my starchy carbohydrates although I do not plan to cut them completely. I strongly feel that despite what keto enthusiasts say it is beneficial and quite natural to have a low to moderate portion of carbs included in my diet and that this will be more sustainable in the long run.  Every meal I have eaten since taking the medication has been home cooked which I think is highly significant coming from eating junk food all day. I am planning my shopping days now to ensure I have food in the fridge at all times.  I am also working towards a caloric deficit of beneath 1800, that said, I have researched intermittent fasting and believe it could be greatly beneficial so long as my diet is also changed.  I'm not new to keto and have done it before but found it was unsustainable after about a month, I just craved a sandwich or a cracker, I feel this is what everyone who does it goes through but some can tolerate it more than others.  Note: I'm not knocking keto, if it works for you then great. I'm just saying its not a lifestyle choice I can cope with.

This week I have also joined a gym (did a weights session today which felt great) and plan to attend indoor cycling classes 3 times a week and doing weights twice a week.  I'm fully committed to tracking my caloric intake, macros, exercise and change my lifestyle completely. I'm ""All in"" as they say and I feel the phentermine is the ace up my sleeve.  As far as my mental health goes; I did have a lull the other day from being kept up a few hours at night from the medication but other than that I am generally feeling absolutely incredible; focused, happier, less stressed and looking forward to the future. In contrast, prior to taking phentermine, I was very easily distracted with my own thoughts and working  a highly technical role this made my job extremely stressful (which leads to more eating), actually it was like I constantly had other things to think about and I felt my work was the distraction, now its my focal point.  Anyway, to summarise; I am fully aware that a lifestyle change is needed to reduce my weight permanently (120kg btw).  I'm using phentermine on a temporary basis and as it was intended: to kick start my weight loss journey.

,loseit,"Hi fellow losers,

It's been a long and weird journey getting here, but I just wanted to share my feelings about health and weightloss and hopefully some of you can relate.

I have no incredible weight loss to report, in fact, I've been hovering up and down for several weeks now, but for the first time in my life when trying to lose weight, I haven't given up and I haven't been discouraged. I've never stuck with a lifestyle change long enough to understand what it is I need to do to succeed, when things hadn't gone my way in the past, I'd just give up and double-down to find I'd gained another 10+ pounds a few months later.

I have lost weight before - 75lbs! But I lost it by eating almost nothing and allowing myself to fall into an incredible depression that made starving myself an appealing type of self-punishment.

For this and other reasons, obviously I gained it all back. 

For over 2 months now, however, I've been on MFP and WW. I track most days, even on really bad days. I've had days where I don't track and weeks where I felt like giving up. I've gone from going on walks consistently to falling back into old sedentary habits, to walking consistently and then back again.

My point is, the process has been messy. It's been imperfect and inconstant. And yet, I've stuck to it.

Like a baby learning to walk, you have to crawl before you can run. I feel so good about just trying and failing and still fighting to get better at this everyday. Though my weight has gone up and down, I've maintained a 10lb loss overall from where I started, and as I get better and better at learning how to tailor my journey to my habits and goals, I can't wait to look back on this time with even more pride than I already feel now.

In my opinion, this is how you lose weight. Not by crash dieting and not by obsessively managing every aspect of your weight loss with overzealous perfectionism. You try. You fail.

Sure it kinda sucks I have to do this again but that’s life for ya. It’s not all linear. As long as you remember to get back up and try again, you’re already a winner. Knowing I’ve succeeded before and trusting the calorie deficit gives me so much confidence I’ll get back to where I was 5 years ago.

,loseit,"Possible trigger warning: mentions of eating disorders

I'm mostly writing this out as a kind of journal entry, but I'm very open to advice or comments!

So I'm a 5 ft, 28 year old woman currently weighing 227 lbs. I, like many people in this sub, have struggled with my weight since I was a child. I've tried just about everything and have almost never had any success except for one time when I was ~21. I've been diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), depression, and OCD. I have also been diagnosed with BED (Binge Eating Disorder), and nearly diagnosed with Anorexia. The near diagnosis of Anorexia stemmed from losing 40 lbs in 3 months when I was ~21. I went from ~220 lbs to ~180 lbs, I hit a plateau and saw my primary to see what I could do to break through it. Initially she complimented my weight loss, but upon hearing about how quickly I lost the weight, how strict I was being, and how triggered my OCD was, she said I was in danger of becoming anorexic. She decided not to officially diagnosis me though for some reason. This shock coupled with the plateau, caused me to crash hard and I have not been able to stay on track for more than a month ever since.

I want so badly to lose weight and be healthy. Losing the weight means the possibility of lessening chronic pain I've had since I was 12 years old (no guarantee as the pain is not weight related, but weight loss *could* help ease the pain). Despite the want, I'm terrified. I don't want to become obsessed again. I started out with 1200 calories/day, but quickly dropped down to 900/day. I was eating half a cup of cereal and milk for breakfasts, a cup of soup or a small salad for lunches, and tiny portions of whatever my parents had made for dinner. I refused to eat anything I didn't know the nutritional info on. I was weighing myself multiple times a day, especially in the morning before and after using the bathroom. My mom ended up hiding the bathroom scale on me and only letting me use it once a week. I was basically hibernating during those 3 months. I slept nearly all day and night and only woke up to use the bathroom and eat. 

I wish I could find some middle ground, but I've tried repeatedly to have some kind of willpower and use moderation but I simply cannot do it. I guess I'm just an all or nothing kind of person. I also have terrible, terrible cravings. If I'm craving something, I have obsessive thoughts about it. I can't stop thinking about it until I have it. I hate to say it, but I even kind of get depressed when I dwell on my cravings. I'm also an incredibly picky eater, so finding healthy things that I **do** like is a bit of a challenge.

On the bright side, now that I live alone, if I don't buy it, I don't have it. I do my best during my weekly grocery shop to not buy junk food. I'm entirely too lazy to drive to the store for one package of Oreos, and I'm far too cheap to pay for delivery. I haven't drank soda (diet, thanks to growing up with a diabetic mom, I'm used to diet and sugar free things) regularly in years, I don't like coffee, I don't cook meat often (just seems like a lot of work for one person), and I recently made the change to almond milk. I do have a pretty active little dog and we go for 20-40 minute walks (time depending on my pain level and weather) 3-4 times a day. I've made some small changes over the years which is nice, but every time I really try to be healthier and still have ""bad"" food in moderation, I end up going off the rails quickly, crashing, and restarting.

I'm so tired of this rinse and repeat cycle I'm in. Maybe it's worth letting the OCD take over and becoming obsessed again, as long as I'm aware of it? Sometimes I just wish I had no choices and could only eat what someone chose for me. Maybe surgery is worth looking into? I don't know. For those wondering, yes, throughout the years I have seen many nutritionists, dieticians, my mom's diabetes doctor (I'm not pre-diabetic but my mom thought she might have some insight), my primary, psychiatrists, and therapists. I've also been a part of a few weight loss support groups as well as a chronic pain support group. Nothing sticks with me for long.

I feel like my thoughts and feelings are a little bit more in order after writing this. I'm probably gonna delete it in a few hours but it was helpful to get it out.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m mostly writing this out as a kind of journal entry, but I&amp;#39;m very open to advice or comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m a 5 ft, 28 year old woman currently weighing 227 lbs. I, like many people in this sub, have struggled with my weight since I was a child. I&amp;#39;ve tried just about everything and have almost never had any success except for one time when I was ~21. I&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), depression, and OCD. I have also been diagnosed with BED (Binge Eating Disorder), and nearly diagnosed with Anorexia. The near diagnosis of Anorexia stemmed from losing 40 lbs in 3 months when I was ~21. I went from ~220 lbs to ~180 lbs, I hit a plateau and saw my primary to see what I could do to break through it. Initially she complimented my weight loss, but upon hearing about how quickly I lost the weight, how strict I was being, and how triggered my OCD was, she said I was in danger of becoming anorexic. She decided not to officially diagnosis me though for some reason. This shock coupled with the plateau, caused me to crash hard and I have not been able to stay on track for more than a month ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want so badly to lose weight and be healthy. Losing the weight means the possibility of lessening chronic pain I&amp;#39;ve had since I was 12 years old (no guarantee as the pain is not weight related, but weight loss &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; help ease the pain). Despite the want, I&amp;#39;m terrified. I don&amp;#39;t want to become obsessed again. I started out with 1200 calories/day, but quickly dropped down to 900/day. I was eating half a cup of cereal and milk for breakfasts, a cup of soup or a small salad for lunches, and tiny portions of whatever my parents had made for dinner. I refused to eat anything I didn&amp;#39;t know the nutritional info on. I was weighing myself multiple times a day, especially in the morning before and after using the bathroom. My mom ended up hiding the bathroom scale on me and only letting me use it once a week. I was basically hibernating during those 3 months. I slept nearly all day and night and only woke up to use the bathroom and eat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could find some middle ground, but I&amp;#39;ve tried repeatedly to have some kind of willpower and use moderation but I simply cannot do it. I guess I&amp;#39;m just an all or nothing kind of person. I also have terrible, terrible cravings. If I&amp;#39;m craving something, I have obsessive thoughts about it.

so i am 19, 5'7"", and about 235 pounds, and according to [this calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/), my tdee is 2,900 for my current exercise level, which is moderate (hard cardio for 40 minutes 4 times a week). subtracting 500 calories for a deficit leaves me at 2,400. this still feels WAY too high. i started ADHD medication that has made my appetite decrease, and if i eat around 1,800 for the day i feel really full and i have trouble imagining eating more for the day. i also realize that if i don't eat enough/rest enough it will only be damaging in the long run. having pcos makes this equation more difficult as there's a lot of conflicting information on whether it impacts BMR or not.

hey everyone! I'm new to this subreddit, but I've been using the LoseIt! calorie tracker app on and off since I was in sixth grade (I'm 22 now, so 12.5 years. I was obese as a kid). 
I'm about halfway through a 5day a week strongman/muscle building lifting plan, full body 4 days a week, upper body on the 5th. My appetite has SKYROCKETED and I'm honestly amazed I managed to maintain a tight 133 for the first three weeks. Since Valentine's Day, though, my weight has jumped up to 135. And while I know gaining weight is expected, given I genuinely want to increase strength on this plan, I'm seriously worried for the last six weeks of it. I came home from college last March and lost ~7 lbs pretty easily (yeah our dining hall food is NOT easy to lose weight on, and I valued comfort foods a little too much). I'm worried I'm going to go back to my pre covid weight (~140) instead of lose these last 5 lbs. I've wanted to weigh 130 for four years now, and I'm so close I can taste it. 
I guess I wanted to introduce myself, and let some stuff off my chest, and see if you guys had  tips on losing the last little bit. I've gotten my maintenance calories to 2200 (more if i accidentally eat low carb but that's just bc water weight) so I sometimes feel very sad on 1800 as a slight deficit. I know it's very very doable, so I've been feeling discouraged I can't even stick to that.

I want to be around 145lbs if possible and finally feel good in my body (numbers arent a big deal if I can build muscle to get to a place I feel confident so 145 is a number goal but I won't be sad if I don't reach that as long as I feel confident in my body).

Hi all,

It's been a weird week for me. Since 24th Jan 2021 (when I hit my lowest weight in my weight loss journey) when I got to 285lbs (started at 314lbs) I have lost no weight at all. instead I have gained, lost, gained, lost, gained, lost....and so on forth. I have been BATTLING with myself to keep to my diet but I keep on losing to my other self. the less disciplined self, the less caring self, the less healthy less, the greedy self, the self who is so scared to lose weight so much so that she sabotages herself, self.

since Jan 24th I have basically been binging, making myself sick, tasting then spitting out food and overeating....it feels so shameful to write this all out. I feel ashamed. but I also feel kinda relieved...? I feel relieved I can admit these things, I can recognise they are wrong and I realise this want within myself to want to change them too. 

so since jan 24th I have basically been ruining all the progress I made then losing weight and repeat. but this week was a lil different.

I posted a week ago about a really bad period which also made me gain a ton (like 10lbs almost) of weight....this week I resolved to not be hard on myself (my hormones are messed up, im on week 3 of my period and in process of getting this checked out now because enough is enough). I have been walking a ton more, eating more balanced, did not make myself vomit even when I kept thinking about it, I did spit out some chocolate once but once I did I decided to just get rid of the chocolate all together, and I have been successfully drinking a ton of water daily. I have been monitoring my weight everyday and it is going down, I know a lot of this water weight from my period but it is still satisfying nevertheless.

my period is making me want to eat sooo much more, so I am (not by a huge margin,I am still in a deficit). right now my period is really messed up and it is messing up my eating/hunger too but instead of dwelling over it and becoming depressed like I have been the previous 2 weeks ive just decided to eat and then quite literally walk it off. I am still in a deficit. today I went a 1000 calories over (past deficit) and I really wanted to make myself sick but I decided I would instead go on a loooooong walk/mini hike tomorrow to burn it off and start afresh (again). 

im not perfect and ive stopped trying to be. I'm tired guys.

weight loss is one of the hardest things I think I have ever tried to do. I keep failing myself but now instead of concentrating on the fails I want to focus on the picking myself back up and doing better for myself. I literally prayed to God before posting this to help me keep in a calorie deficit tomorrow and to help my balance out my over eating today.... (I feel like im in this same constant mistake making loop)

I don't know what exactly I expect in a response here...I know a lot of this is self-destructive behaviour and points to a lot of issues with food...I have had therapy before but I keep making the same mistakes and I kinda don't know what to do to stop doing it. so I guess im sharing here to just get it off my chest. I know the mistakes I am making and how to avoid them/fix them but there is SOMETHING inside me which doesn't allow me to. is it the fear? I have a fear that ill loose weight and still won't love my physical self or still won't find love or happiness... I don't know. but I do know I am tired. I sooooo tired of this. I want progress, not negative and useless repetition.

I have to talk to my dietician on Monday and I am SCARED. I am DREADING it cos I feel emabarressed and ashamed to admit all the above. I was going to lie, quite honestly. but what good will that do? im scared to tell her all this. I am really scared, ashamed and embarrassed of myself. but at this point I feel like I almost deserve to have that feeling after how I treat myself. I feel so hopeless sometimes!

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m old enough that I know better than to wish time away, but when you are on CICO and you are eating at a deficit, and you know at the end of the rainbow you&amp;#39;ll move back up to maintenance, you kind of wouldn&amp;#39;t mind getting there ..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the setbacks are boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like watching paint dry.  Or .. more like watching dried paint get old and flake off, one little piece at a time, bit by bit .. s l o w l y ... o v e r ... t i m e ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It.  is.  so.  bore.  ing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**leans back and stares at the ceiling**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it is the consistency, the day to day grind that does the job .. it ain&amp;#39;t rocket science.  It is just doing the same.  boring.  thing.  every.  single.  day.&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"So as I’m sure it has for most people, the pandemic hit me hard. I’m a 27M and I weigh around 400 lbs. I’ve gone through about 3-4 weight loss spurts where I’ve lost 20-30 lbs and then stop as I’m sure others do the same. With everything opening up again, me getting vaccinated, and the summer coming, I really want to lose weight again but man my motivation is just not there. Whenever I have started to lose weight before there’s always this burst of energy and I really get pumped but it always fizzles as I’m sure most of you have felt the same way. I don’t even have this feeling again of being incredibly motivated but I have felt myself slipping into old bad habits harder than before. Eating candy, drinking soda, etc. I feel like I eat like I’m still 15 sometimes and the realization of getting older and weight loss becoming harder has mentally sent me to a place where I feel this is obviously something I need to do. I don’t want to be this weight, I shouldn’t be this weight, and it feels more and more unhealthy by the day.

For some context: I’ve always been a “big guy” and of course have used that as an excuse for myself. More than that, I’ve always been “athletic” even for my build. I played a lot of sports and even on my last stint of working out, I was able to do about 25 push-ups at 385lbs which I know isn’t necessarily ordinary so I have used that excuse as a reason to stay unhealthy. Here’s the thing; I like working out. I like feeling strong. I like getting stronger. I like how I feel when I eat healthier. I like how I feel when I drink an appropriate amount of water throughout the day. But all of this feels so hard when I’ve been treating my body like trash for so long. I want to change but man do I feel hopeless and like it’ll never be enough. It always feels like I’ll be back at square one.  I have the tools, I just never use them. I know how to count calories, how to use my TDEE, how to form a workout plan that I can sustain. I feel like I just lack the discipline and willpower to stay committed. I know it may never come and I might be better off just doing it because that just might be the best thing for me. I have other mental health issues and I definitely have an “addictive personality” in which I get really involved with activities and then stop them when I get bored. I guess I’m posting this for accountability, support, and advice. 

A good quote for anyone looking for inspiration and what I’m telling myself right now from one of my favorite books is: “The most important step a man can take. It's not the first one, is it? 
It's the next one. Always the next step, Dalinar” -Brandon Sanderson, Oathbringer.

So this is me, taking my next step, and looking to take many more. Please if you have any advice or words of encouragement I could really use them right now.

I don’t even have this feeling again of being incredibly motivated but I have felt myself slipping into old bad habits harder than before. Eating candy, drinking soda, etc. I feel like I eat like I’m still 15 sometimes and the realization of getting older and weight loss becoming harder has mentally sent me to a place where I feel this is obviously something I need to do. I don’t want to be this weight, I shouldn’t be this weight, and it feels more and more unhealthy by the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some context: I’ve always been a “big guy” and of course have used that as an excuse for myself. More than that, I’ve always been “athletic” even for my build. I played a lot of sports and even on my last stint of working out, I was able to do about 25 push-ups at 385lbs which I know isn’t necessarily ordinary so I have used that excuse as a reason to stay unhealthy. Here’s the thing; I like working out. I like feeling strong. I like getting stronger. I like how I feel when I eat healthier. I like how I feel when I drink an appropriate amount of water throughout the day. But all of this feels so hard when I’ve been treating my body like trash for so long. I want to change but man do I feel hopeless and like it’ll never be enough. It always feels like I’ll be back at square one.  I have the tools, I just never use them. I know how to count calories, how to use my TDEE, how to form a workout plan that I can sustain. I feel like I just lack the discipline and willpower to stay committed. I know it may never come and I might be better off just doing it because that just might be the best thing for me. I have other mental health issues and I definitely have an “addictive personality” in which I get really involved with activities and then stop them when I get bored. I guess I’m posting this for accountability, support, and advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good quote for anyone looking for inspiration and what I’m telling myself right now from one of my favorite books is: “The most important step a man can take. It&amp;#39;s not the first one, is it? 
It&amp;#39;s the next one. Always the next step, Dalinar” -Brandon Sanderson, Oathbringer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is me, taking my next step, and looking to take many more. Please if you have any advice or words of encouragement I could really use them right now. Thank you so much and I hope to become a more active member in this wonderful community.&lt;/p&gt;

I just want to warn that I will be bringing up details of an ED that I developed during my weight loss journey. My main purpose of posting this is to ask for help and advice on what to do now.

I have posted on this sub before about how I was struggling to cope with my body changing and accepting that I am no longer as big as I was. I started my journey at 250lbs and these days I have been swinging between 165lbs-170lbs (about 5 months). I reached the 160s quickly because I started heavy restriction when I got stuck at 175lbs. During the restriction I also increased my daily steps dramatically. To give an idea of my day: consuming under 1000 cal, burning 80% of it by walking. I am 5'6 F in my early 20s.

This has obviously brought me to where I am now. Struggling to make any progress, mental health declining, afraid of food, and worried about gaining too much weight trying to fix my metabolism.

So I was feeling pretty discouraged because my weight loss has been pretty slow in general mostly because I just can’t do the high deficit thing anymore. I don’t know, I’m just tired of being hungry, demonizing food, getting obsessive. So my only goal now is to eat below 1700 and even then I probably have a day a week I go over, but I usually average out between 1400-1600 cals a day per week. And yes and you can see, I lose a few pounds a month. 

I’ve been working out just to be able to eat more food and get some strength because I’m also tired of needing people to help me carry everything. I’ve been doing some Beachbody programs (Barre Blend and now I’m on LIIFT4). I would do a 5k on one or two of the off days just because I really like running. 

Anyways, so lots of NSV like building a better relationship with food, getting buff, better balance, and more endurance. But sometimes instead of seeing the 10 lbs I’ve lost, I just feel the 25-35 lbs weighing down on me. I don’t know why, but I just felt heavy this week. It messed up my run Wednesday because all I could think of is “you have to drag this fat body up the hill with you.” Like whoa, I thought we were past that? Where did that come from? 

But today, I was dancing to some music I discovered (Mother by Danzig if you’re interested) and I felt kind of hot! Like I was checking myself out and finally like it clicked. I have been doing measurements, but I was only focusing on how my boobs and ass shrunk. But my stomach is flatter. Still some fat there, but it doesn’t just hang out anymore. And I can get low! Like reeeeal low. A lot more flexible too. 

It was a good feeling and a nice reminder that I am doing the right thing and making the right changes. It might be slow, but the key is to find those good moments on the way down.

I had an ED a few years ago. Dropped from a BMI of 20 to about 16 (I guess 120 lbs —&gt; 80 lbs) and then gained it back in a long, tearful, gruelling process.

My life was in shambles when my ED started. As my life resolved, I had more time to fix my ED and focus on the things and people I loved: school, my friends, my family (after we sorted out some issues), running, art, etc. In fact, I achieved my dream of getting into med school at 20!

And now I have my ED mostly under wraps. I live alone so there’s a lot of liberty with how I eat (i.e. meal times and no one can scold me for missing meals etc.)

I’ve recently been a little dissatisfied with my body. Just wanting to trim a little here and there. So I got MyFitnessPal again.

It made me so sad. And so guilty. And I realized I eat way more than I thought I did.

Can you really tell if someone should be eating more high carb/low fat vs. high fat/low carb just based on their genes? LoseIt recommends 15-25% fat calories and 55-65% carb calories for my ratios based on DNA traits.

,loseit,"I needed to lose 20 pounds and started on January 1 with a plan that I’ve found remarkably easy, I thought I would share in case it helps others. So far I’ve lost 16 pounds so will hit my goal in the next few weeks.  

- I start the day with 2 low calorie protein shakes (200 calories in total with 3 pints of water), makes me feel full till 10am when I eat breakfast. 

- Breakfast is porridge oats which keeps me going till 1pm, coming in around 150 calories as I have a small portion with water

- Lunch is a soup, a whole meal thin with butter and one square of dark chocolate,  coming around 400 calories 

- I walk for 60 minutes as quickly as I can in the afternoon at some point, I get out of breath, my Apple Watch says I’m doing about 50 mins of exercise out of my total 60 mins walking, I have 2 pints of water when I get back 

- In the afternoon at some point I eat kefir as a snack which is good for my gut, I also have 2 pints of water and feel full (around 150 calories)

- I eat dinner around 6pm and it’s made up of a big bag of kale or similar with a spicy sauce, jalapeños, peppers and what ever else looks like flavour, and I mix in some chopped small amounts chicken, fish or nut roast with the kale in a wok, so I have a huge portion, covers the whole plate of spicy, tasty greens with 2 pints of water with 1 square of dark chocolate (this is around 400 calories)

- I gave up alcohol and found a low calorie, non alcohol beer I liked. Took me a while but I found Brooklyn which I really like and is less than 80 calories. 

- I do 30 mins of weights every other evening while watching the tv. I have a fold up weight bench and dumbbells, and I do a simple routine for my shoulders, chest, thighs and arms. Sorry I know I’m focusing on my mirror muscles! 

- Before bed I have a 1 scoop (100 calorie protein shake) 

So I eat about 1500 to 1700 calories per day, the walking burns around 300 calories and the weights about the same. My fitness pal and my watch tells I’m in deficit by between 400 and 700 calories per day. 

All the food is easy and quick to prepare, available at my local store (which I walk to every day to help with my steps), and at no point do I ever feel hungry. Clearly the water really helps with feeling full. 

Downsides 
1. I wake up to pee in the night! 
2. I have had some constipation so have added a syrup of figs into my morning routine

Upsides 
1. I’m nearly 50 and feel great, I’ve had to buy some new trousers and enjoy wearing clothes again.

I am a man who's weight fluctuates a lot... Typically my cycle goes..

1. Go from about 165lbs to 180lbs
2. Do keto for 45 days
3. Back to 165lbs
4. Repeat

This has happened about 3 times; this time I weighed myself and I was 195lbs and realized that my usual approach was not ideal, and I'd like to keep it off.

I don't have the commitment to stick to a schedule, or a particular diet, I also hate cooking and my job/hobbies both involve me sitting at a desk.

So, this time I bought a Fitbit (charge 4), paid for premium and Fitbit Coach, and also paid for MyFitnessPal. 

My new routine is simply:

- Calorie goal of 1450 (Macros below, but I dont follow these strictly at all)
 - Carbs: 181g
 - Fat: 48g
 - Protein: 73g
- I do a 10 minute daily workout on Fitbit Coach. It's a mixture between bodyweight exercises, some cardio, and a sprinkling of yoga.
- I run twice a week, not much, because I am ridiculously out of shape.

And finally a few stats:

,loseit,"TL;DR Thanks to OMAD I’ve taken control of my hunger/cravings and I can keep myself from eating a whole pizza in one sitting. 

I love pizza. Lemme say that again. I LOVE pizza. It’s my favorite freakin food. And, once COVID hit, I was stuck in my house with a bunch of time on my hands and some savings left over (workplace closed cause of COVID and I was out of a job). I ate quite a few deep-dish/pan crust/extra cheese pizzas from Domino’s all by myself, in my room, in between my many hours of sedentary video game playing. And maybe I’d also order a multi-serving side of alfredo pasta too. Oh and some of those breaded chicken bites they got. Oh and I never forget the ranch dip. I went wild. And it was great for the first few months. COVID hit right in the middle of my final semester at college, and boy was I burnt out. I needed a break and the stay at home orders felt like a godsend! Just eating tasty fast food (like pizza) and playing videogames, all day long. 

Until I clocked in at 260 lbs a month ago (I’m a 5’11” male). In 2018, when I was in the best shape and lowest weight of my life, I was at a muscular 170 lbs. That means, in 3 years, I have come to be 10 lbs short of being 100 lbs heavier than I was when I was in control of my weight and my health. 

Well, I’ve been doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) for maybe 2 weeks now? eating at noon everyday. (That’s following several failed attempts of getting myself back on track with my weight.) And it SUCKED at first. Mad cravings towards the night, lots of glasses of water to combat said cravings. A cheat day somewhere in between. But I’ve been doing it. And slowly the evening cravings have gotten less intense. AND, I’m not binging on food for the one meal I do get to eat. 

That’s where the pizza comes in. Finally ordered some Domino’s for the first time in forever. Guess what I got? Pan crust pepperoni and cheese pizza. Side of alfredo pasta. Ate all the pasta, it was only 600 cals. But the pizza.... man oh man what a good pizza. I can’t just let this all sit in the box. Just one more slice.......

NOPE. Ate 3 slices, closed the box, and put it in the fridge! That’s my meal for the day! And still under my TDEE calorie count. I’m honestly amazed and PROUD of myself for doing it. So many failures have lead to this, this simple decision that I consider to be a huge, crazy important victory for me. And best part of it all, I still got to eat the rest of the pizza. Ate the last few slices today, again within my calories. I just wanted to share this with y’all out of a combination of pride/excitement and also hoping that maybe in sharing my personal weight loss related trials and tribulations, someone who needs some inspiration can get it.

Last November, I decided to take about a month and a half to maintain. I was burnt out on weight loss, and the 500 calorie deficit was starting to really get to me. In January, I went back to a calorie deficit, this time only 250, with the expectation that I would lose weight again, but that it would slooow.

And is has been slow. So freaking slow. 0.5 lbs per week is agonizingly slow, and sometimes a month will go by and the number won't change. It can be so discouraging.

But you know what has changed in this time? My measurements.

I took my measurements in December, when I was maintaining, because I have shrunk out of all of my clothing and, for the holidays, decided to treat myself to a nice, wool skirt. I had a 36"" waist.

I have a lot of injuries, and I mostly get exercise in two ways: walking and belly dancing. In these last few months of eating at a deficit, I started being more consistent, especially in my dancing. It's less about burning calories, though I am certainly happy with the extra food for the day-- dancing just feels good, and you can stop whenever anything starts to hurt in a bad way.

Last week, out of sheer frustration with the number on the scale and the desperate hope that all this work and deficit eating had gotten me somewhere, I decided to take my measurements, and GUYS.

&amp;#x200B;

**3 inches off my waist.**

**1 inch off each of my thighs.**

**.25 inches off my neck.**

**.25 inches off one of my arms, .5 off the other.**

**2 inches off my underbust. That means my bra is down a full band size.**

&amp;#x200B;

Guys. I didn't believe it. Seriously, I thought there was something wrong. Maybe I was really dehydrated? So I checked again the next day, and it was the same.

I checked again yesterday. .25 off the second arm, so they both lost .5 inches.

My scale has basically not moved in the last four months, but my measurements sure have. Weight is not the only metric.

All of this to say: PLEASE take your measurements.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.25 inches off my neck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.25 inches off one of my arms, .5 off the other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 inches off my underbust. That means my bra is down a full band size.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys. I didn&amp;#39;t believe it. Seriously, I thought there was something wrong. Maybe I was really dehydrated? So I checked again the next day, and it was the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked again yesterday. .25 off the second arm, so they both lost .5 inches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My scale has basically not moved in the last four months, but my measurements sure have. Weight is not the only metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this to say: PLEASE take your measurements. It seriously saved my mental game, and made me feel so encouraged about continuing the deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

Weigh in daily, enter in Libra &amp; report here even if I don’t like it: 232.6 this morning, 231.1 lbs trend weight. Heeeey guess who has a uterus in full-fledged violent coup? This lady.

I am almost 40 lbs down now, which means my clothes are getting loose. 

I am not at goal weight yet so I can’t invest in a ton of new stuff but I do have to be, uh, clothed 😂 so I bought some new stuff.

But as I went to put said new stuff in my closet (it’s an Ikea thing so just a lot of drawers, no hangers) it hit me.

my closet was a disaster area.

Not because it was a gross mess (it was!) but because of the way it felt. Like a black hole of despair, source of sad feelings, vibe of profound sadness. The thing I opened every day and hated.

I stood there looking at these heaps of wrinkled, some even stained, stretched out “fat” clothes. All of it shoved into drawers. Hate clothes.

This closet clearly belonged to a person who was used to hiding so “why did it matter what she looked like.” These were the clothes of a person who hated getting dressed in the morning. 

(I know this is not always the case but it was for me. The weight gain had made me stop caring.)

Well, I went crazy 😝 

I dumped every single thing on the floor. After dusting the crap out of the shelves (which were gross and dirty) I tore through the piles. I filled an entire trash bag with clothes to throw out and another TWO bags with clothes to donate.

And then finally I folded &amp; placed my few new things into the pristine, empty wooden drawers. 

I stepped back, and felt the most profound weight lifting away.

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to** r/Loseit!

&amp;#x200B;

So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why you’re overweight

&amp;#x200B;

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before You Start

&amp;#x200B;

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tracking

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

&amp;#x200B;

# Creating Your Deficit

&amp;#x200B;

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Exercise

&amp;#x200B;

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Crawl, Walk, Run

&amp;#x200B;

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Acceptance

&amp;#x200B;

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.

This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  &lt;a href=""/r/loseit""&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; recommends an app like &lt;a href=""https://www.myfitnesspal.com/""&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""http://loseit.com""&gt;Loseit!&lt;/a&gt; (unaffiliated), or &lt;a href=""https://cronometer.com""&gt;Cronometer&lt;/a&gt;.  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you&amp;#39;re eating is more important than what you&amp;#39;re eating.  Why?  &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU""&gt;This may explain it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Creating Your Deficit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  &lt;a href=""/r/loseit""&gt;r/loseit&lt;/a&gt; has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Exercise&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel *awesome* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Crawl, Walk, Run&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Acceptance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will &lt;em&gt;struggle&lt;/em&gt;.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to say though that  as of weighing myself today, I’m no longer in that “obese” category and now just “overweight”. It might seem small but seeing that made me want to cry because it’s the first time in at least 5 years that I haven’t been obese. &lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"Hey everybody! I’m so happy to announce that I finally reached 200lbs from my starting point of 260 back in August. 

Some info on my journey. I’m 17M, and in August I weighed &gt;260lbs, and decided I needed to start working on myself after my brother got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and was on insulin at 21 years old. This terrified me and pushed me into changing my life so I could hopefully avoid it. I started off with just walking a lot, 5 miles a day outside. In September I found this sub, learned about CICO, and started calorie counting. I’m eating ~1700-1800 calories a day. Things went extremely well, my parents are super supportive of me, and my dad is using the LoseIt app as well, and helps make and shares the food when he makes dinner. Anytime throughout these past few months I felt close to giving up, I started going through this sub. Seeing everyone’s accomplishments, struggles, questions, answers really motivated me and kept my mind focused on completing my goals. And finally today, I reached exactly 200lbs! My ultimate goal is 185 and then to start working out and gain muscle.

Some NSV I’ve noticed: My Jean waist size went from a 42 to a 34 inch, my shirt size went from XXL to L, my skin is clearer, my confidence is finally not terrible and I feel comfortable going outside in t-shirts, I can walk a lot more than I used to be able to, snowboarding is a heck a lot more fun now and I don’t get tired right away, and I sleep WAY better. I even had to retake my senior pictures because I looked so much different than I did in August!

,loseit,"Hi, Since 2021 I’ve been trying to lose weight and despite having a really strong start, it is now completely stagnated. 

My weight is already healthy, sitting at a BMI value of 24, but I want to lose weight nonetheless because I’m not satisfied with my body. I decided to start my weight loss process after Christmas/NYE and my birthday (january 1). I weighed myself January 2 and the result was 87,5kg. After 2 weeks I reduced it to 84,5kg. I was stoked and motivated to lose even more (didn’t have a specific goal). At the end of January my weight was 84kg. I already thought that was pretty weird because I was doing the exact same as I did the first 2 weeks, but didn’t really paid attention to it and just assumed that it was a bad timing. 

However, it’s now March 5 and my weight is still exactly 84kg. This really demotivates me and I’m even feeling like quitting. I’m going running 2/3 times per week for an hour each, I stay below 1500 calories everyday, with the only exceptions being sometimes on Saturday/Friday but even on those days it’s still below 2500, which is the preferred amount for adult men.

I had maintained 145 for about a year until I got my office job where I sit around all day and eat extra meals from stress and just not really having extra time for passions besides wanting to eat and go out for drinks with coworkers.

,loseit,"Sorry my writing ability can be foggy at times.

So I am 16, and I am healthy in general. I'm good at basketball and want to try my hand at gridiron football. I go on jogs and even used to lift weights in PE (I can't afford a gym membership) and I used to squat 105 and bench 75. I even have a six pack under all my fat. 

When I was a child I was skin and bones, literally no fat at all. My dad fed me all the junk food you could imagine for me to gain weight. He even took me to doctors but it turns out my metabolism was in full gear. He left when I was 11 (I weighed like 90 pounds then) and I just kept eating like I normally would (I still do). When I was 13 (2017) I stated noticing a bit of flab and by 2018 I was fat. People started making fun of me for my moobs but I've shrunk them down. I tried my first diet (keto) in march 2019 and that was too hard. I tried again in septemeber 2019,  february 2020, and june/july 2020 and failed. Then in july 2020 I, weighing 150 pounds went on a 1500 calorie diet and lost 20 pound in four months. I had a healthy workout schedule, I meditated, slept well and everything. I then relapsed and gained it all back in 4 months.

Last night I told my mom and stepdad about a 1000 calorie diet I was on to burn fat quickly.

&lt;p&gt;So I am 16, and I am healthy in general. I&amp;#39;m good at basketball and want to try my hand at gridiron football. I go on jogs and even used to lift weights in PE (I can&amp;#39;t afford a gym membership) and I used to squat 105 and bench 75. I even have a six pack under all my fat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a child I was skin and bones, literally no fat at all. My dad fed me all the junk food you could imagine for me to gain weight. He even took me to doctors but it turns out my metabolism was in full gear. He left when I was 11 (I weighed like 90 pounds then) and I just kept eating like I normally would (I still do). When I was 13 (2017) I stated noticing a bit of flab and by 2018 I was fat. People started making fun of me for my moobs but I&amp;#39;ve shrunk them down. I tried my first diet (keto) in march 2019 and that was too hard. I tried again in septemeber 2019,  february 2020, and june/july 2020 and failed. Then in july 2020 I, weighing 150 pounds went on a 1500 calorie diet and lost 20 pound in four months. I had a healthy workout schedule, I meditated, slept well and everything.

Today's topic: **Is it worth it?**

A few days ago I saw a post asking if the weight loss was worth it. ""Do people treat you better? Do you feel better? Do you find it easier to meet people?"" So that started me thinking about what exactly made my journey ""worth it"" for me. 

Of course it was worth it from a health perspective. I will be going in for my annual physical in a couple of weeks and we'll see what my doctor thinks. I got off CPAP, maybe I can get off my blood pressure meds this year.

I'm also way more fit than I have ever been in my adult life thanks to being more regularly active. Even though I have not been running much this month, I have been walking 7500-10000 steps most days and keeping up with the NHS Strength and Flex routine that has been providing a reasonable alternative to running that should actually help me when I start running again.

At the core though it boils down to a single simple thing for me now. Self confidence. I know that I am capable of doing something most people find quite elusive: Losing a very significant amount of weight and keeping it off for longer than a year. I am in control of my weight. If I overeat, it's no one else's fault. All mine. If my eating habits lead to weight gain over time, it's my fault for not adjusting my intake to whatever my current activity levels may be.

I know well the simple knob I need to adjust so that I can stay at my current weight level. Eating just a little bit less if I want my weight to trend downwards. For the past 90 days or so I've been on a slight upwards trend. Happy Scale shows my trend weight going up at about 2 lbs/90 days so 8 lbs a year, ~100 kcal/day over maintenance at ~155. As the weather improves, and I can resume running regularly, I expect that trend will reverse. But I also know that don't need to really change much until I look at the March/April/May trend. Even if I gain another 2 lbs by June, my trend weight will be at the middle of my 10 lb maintenance range.

Anyhow, that self confidence is what drives a lot of the other non-medical benefits of keeping the weight off. Even though we're not in a current pandemic situation that allows for much in the way of social interaction, presenting myself with more confidence makes it easier to strike up random conversations and makes it easier for others to treat you well and meeting new friends or potential romantic partners.

So what about you Centurion? What makes losing 100+ lbs worth it for you? Is there some benefit of losing the weight that you didn't expect?",t2_it80rhl,False,,0,False,"[Century Club] March 4, 2021 - Have you lost or need to lose 100 lbs or more?

Hey guys I recently started gym as I’m 16 and wanted to get in shape.
My stomach and chest stick out weirdly and the most annoying bit is the crease i above my belly button. 

I want a flat stomach so I can work on abs and chest but I don’t know what to do is it my posture or bloating or abs weakness or a mix of them.
I’m not sure how to attack my stomach and chest and what I can do any advice I want to fix it.

I’m thinking to start an training as it’s probably just a weak core and chest I really don’t like crunches they give me migraines And make me feel sick swinging back and forth.

,loseit,"I am F/31/5'4"". I currently weigh 177 pounds. In Feb 2019, I was over 200 pounds, and I started my weight loss journey. It wasnt the first time I tried to lose weight, but it was the first time I was successful. I did CICO and a lot of walking and cardio, and within 9 months i had lost 60 pounds. I was so proud, and confident, and convinced I'd never return to my ways. I never did quite reach my goal (127) but I was down to 143 at my lowest.

Then came the pandemic, and the lockdowns, and my whole life went topsy-turvy. I couldnt get out, my kid was home all the time, my husband was home all the time. It was cheaper to just cave into their meals than eat all my carefully planned ones. I quit exercising. I started binging. I stopped weighing myself, measuring myself, taking photos.

Here I am, almost completely back to square one. I was 180 pounds on Sunday when I finally mustered the courage and strength to take control of my life again. I know I can do this, because I've done it before, but that doesn't take the sting out of it. I've gained 12 inches around my hips, 13 inches around my thighs... like what? Wtf did I do? How did I let it spiral this long? I'd be lying if I said I havent been an emotional wreck all week long. I'm trying to not beat myself up about it... but I'd be lying if I said I haven't done that, too.

I'm determined, though. I can and will fix this. This was just another step in my journey. An experience to learn from, and make adjustments so I dont crumple under such sudden life changes. But last time... I was really lonely. I dont have any friends where I live, and I could really use a friend on a similar journey to share experiences with. Someone to cheer on, and care enough to cheer me on, too. I'm hoping to find that here. Preferably someone close to my stats, but I wont be picky about that, either. I will say I'd rather the person be female, though. I've had a lot of creepy guys in my PMs last time when I would post my progress, so I'm leery of guys reaching out, sorry!

I&amp;#39;m hoping to find that here. Preferably someone close to my stats, but I wont be picky about that, either. I will say I&amp;#39;d rather the person be female, though. I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of creepy guys in my PMs last time when I would post my progress, so I&amp;#39;m leery of guys reaching out, sorry!&lt;/p&gt;

Weight Loss Plan:
Goal: By the 30 September 2021 I will weigh 147lb and will be lean and strong.

Starting Position: I will take before photos and then weekly photos after that. I will weigh every week and I will measure my waist. I will take weekly progress photos.

Nutrition: I will eat 1,400 calories a day with a rough 30% protein, 35% fat and 35% carbs. I will plan my food each week and it will include 3x meals and an evening snack. I will think about nutrition &amp; protein intake &amp; water intake.

Workouts: before the gym re-open I will aim to walk 7,500 to 10,000 steps a day and do a home workout 3x per week based around body weight movements

After the gym re-open I will do 3x 5x5 workouts of some description and aim to get stronger on deadlifts, bench press, overhead press and squat. I will also aim to get stronger on these lifts.

I will post starting photos and measurements at some point over the next few days and I will weigh monday morning.

,loseit,"Hi!

I’m female, 21, 5’4.5” and 120-125 lbs. Always been fairly slender looking and people are usually surprised that my weight is what it is.

I also run about 80-100km/ month and try to either hit the gym, if it’s open, about 3-5 times a week on top of my run OR lately since it’s closed - do a home workout using bodyweight - about 30 minutes or so. I’ve got a fairly defined core but I still look a little “fluffy” for my taste.

My diet is pretty clean, I never eat out (and if I do it’s once a month or so, because my boyfriend and I love sushi). I like fruits and veg and have some everyday. Love coffee. Have a finicky bowel though :’)

My calorie intake roughly varies from 1300 - 2200 per day (I’ve had trouble with food and restriction in the past so I’m trying to get a grip on normal eating). I’m trying to track what I eat now and not go over 1800 (I’ve had trouble keeping it at 1500 or less though, other than on days I under-eat from anxiety).

I’m a full time student in a pretty strenuous program, so a lot of my day is spent sitting - but once I’m done a year or so more, my program/career will require lots of walking and standing in the OR/hospital. This is partially why I love running because it shakes out some of my stress. I try to go on a walk, a run, and a little workout when I have time so my body doesn’t have extremely long periods of idleness. 

How many calories and how much exercise do I need if I’d like to just lean out a little? I can’t seem to shed the extra bit of fluff off my now pretty muscular legs. I’d want to lose maybe 10 lbs in a sustainable way, just to gain some more definition. I know I can MyFitnessPal it - but when I cut my calories I feel tired and foggy and can’t focus on school because of hunger. This is why intermittent fasting couldn’t be an option for me.

I've also began counting my calories and have upped the amount of water i intake a day by about double from what I used to. I've been eating one meal a day and have limited myself to around ~1000 - ~1500 calories daily, with the occasional day here and there of around ~2000 calories or maybe even a small bit more (it's hard to resist a pastry or sweet food for me sometimes and I give in some days, but hey I'm human)

I work an app based job which has me on my feet walking around grocery stores all day. I dont eat or drink anything besides water from the moment I wake up to when I finish working in the evening and then have dinner. I dont even feel hungry for lunch or breakfast. I've also completely cut out snacking throughout the day. No more chips or candy unless I'm specifically having some as a dessert.

&lt;p&gt;I know the scale doesn&amp;#39;t tell the full story. I know I&amp;#39;m losing fat because I&amp;#39;m working out hard and eating at a deficit. I know you hold on to water weight if your muscles are sore. I know all this but I keep stepping on that scale! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting under that 200 mark is a huge deal for me. I think I&amp;#39;d happily chuck my scale in the trash once I&amp;#39;m there, but until then those six pounds are my albatross around my neck. It&amp;#39;s such a psychological battle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone successfully broken up with their scale and had a few tips? Or even been there? I dunno, I&amp;#39;m just struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been using MyFitnessPal as a tracker, and it has had my daily calories at around 1900 for the past several months for 2 lbs/ week. I played with the goals today and it dropped my daily calories down to 1500 ish for the same 2 lbs/week loss.

But I didn’t feel like I was losing much at 1900 before. It was only about 1 lb/week. I absolutely want to fit into a kayak by August- and that means 40 lbs in 5 months. 

Can I just eat the calories for 1900 daily, and then exercise so the net is below the 1500? Or does that cause issues health wise and I need to stick to the net 1900 per day?

Hi guys!

&amp;#x200B;

So I've reached a plateau in my weight loss journey. I have been the same weight for 2 months. I track calories and generally eat healthy (fruits, mostly protein, not a lot of carbs). In regards to exercise I either go on a 4.5 km run or do a strength training session at the gym. But I have been running for those 2 months and I cannot seem to lose weight. FYI my TDEE says I have a Basal Metabolic Rate of 1719 calories per day and that my maintenance calories are 2900! I rarely eat 2900 calories but still I cannot seem to budge the scale anymore. Does anyone have any tips? Or do you think I will eventually lose weight if I keep exercising how I am exercising and tracking calories? 

Also does anyone have any recommendations on what my calorie intake should be? I am sure around 1700-2000 is reasonable. I know calorie trackers in regards to exercise are not necessarily accurate but let's just pretend they were - that would mean if I ate 1700 calories (my metabolic rate) and then kept exercising (i track with an apple watch that I burn 350 cals on a 30 min run, and 500 cals at the gym) I should probably start to lose weight, no?

,loseit,"Hi. I just wanted to share my experience here. I started off around 85is kilos. At my peak, I must have been like 96kg. Anyways, in a year I lost around 25-30 kilos. And well it felt damn awesome. 

I became so obsessed with CICO and eating at a deficit didn't even feel difficult. It  became natural to eat healthy. As a matter of fact, I almost hated junk food like chips, etc. They tasted bland to me. People didn't like my appearance.. and looking back I feel like I must have done a bit too much. At my lowest exactly two years ago, I was 61kg with out any muscle.

Now, after that, in the summer of 2019, I joined a gym and it actually turned out well. I seemed healthy and I actually felt like a looked better for some reason. 

This was until the pandemic. I actually lost like 3 kilos during the lockdown. Then, I moved back home and my eating habits got ruined. I ated junk all the time. I gained 10 kilos in 4 months. And then I moved out of there. Simply, because I was scared that if I stay there long, I will get fat again. 

I have been trying to lose it since then,but man is it hard. It's really hard. I have actually put on 5 kilos since coming here.(not entirely fat as I have been working out a lot). 

Today, I weighed myself, I am just 1kg shy of 80. And I immediately started on deficit. It's so hard rn,but I have to keep at it. I don't have any other choice. None of clothes fit me. I can't even run a mile now. It will be tough,really tough but have to do it. 

Tbh, if you ask me if I look better now than when I am at my lowest, I would say now. It's amazing how ""bigger"" I was, when I was full of fat vs now when I have a little bit of muscle. And people wouldn't even say that I look fat or anything unless they see my weight. I dont even have a big gut. It's pretty flat honestly. I do have bloated face now.

I just wanted to share my experience here. I started off around 85is kilos. At my peak, I must have been like 96kg. Anyways, in a year I lost around 25-30 kilos. And well it felt damn awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became so obsessed with CICO and eating at a deficit didn&amp;#39;t even feel difficult. It  became natural to eat healthy. As a matter of fact, I almost hated junk food like chips, etc. They tasted bland to me. People didn&amp;#39;t like my appearance.. and looking back I feel like I must have done a bit too much. At my lowest exactly two years ago, I was 61kg with out any muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, after that, in the summer of 2019, I joined a gym and it actually turned out well. I seemed healthy and I actually felt like a looked better for some reason. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was until the pandemic. I actually lost like 3 kilos during the lockdown. Then, I moved back home and my eating habits got ruined. I ated junk all the time. I gained 10 kilos in 4 months. And then I moved out of there. Simply, because I was scared that if I stay there long, I will get fat again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to lose it since then,but man is it hard. It&amp;#39;s really hard. I have actually put on 5 kilos since coming here.(not entirely fat as I have been working out a lot). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I weighed myself, I am just 1kg shy of 80. And I immediately started on deficit. It&amp;#39;s so hard rn,but I have to keep at it. I don&amp;#39;t have any other choice. None of clothes fit me. I can&amp;#39;t even run a mile now. It will be tough,really tough but have to do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tbh, if you ask me if I look better now than when I am at my lowest, I would say now. It&amp;#39;s amazing how &amp;quot;bigger&amp;quot; I was, when I was full of fat vs now when I have a little bit of muscle. And people wouldn&amp;#39;t even say that I look fat or anything unless they see my weight. I dont even have a big gut. It&amp;#39;s pretty flat honestly. I do have bloated face now. And people can tell I have gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;

,loseit,"Hi all. Since last November (2019) I have lost 47 pounds. I went from 175 ish and now am about 128-129. I started in January at 140 and hit 128 February 8th, but have now been stuck here. I lost the weight through staying around 1100-1300 cals with light exercise, and for the past few weeks i’ve been on 1200 with no change. I’m 5’5, 18, and count religiously, oil and everything, with cups + double weighed on a scale. I even took a diet break 2 weeks ago where I went around 1500 cals, and my weight maintained. I am 128-129 and want to be around 123/124, as I still have a decent amount of stomach fat.

,loseit,"Hello reddit!


I hope you guys are all doing well! 

My whole life I'm suffering from a Binge Eating Disorder. Most of the time my way to fight it was completely restrict me from any trigger foods. My trigger foods are sweets. My level of BED is pretty intense. To give you an idea of what I'm going through I throw in some pictures.

[This is like almost 20k calories in sweets right there. That is maybe enough for two days.](https://i.imgur.com/umn9yvP.jpg)

[This is from just one day. And it doesn't even show the fast food I had on top.](https://i.imgur.com/v9J1GJ1.jpg)

Hopefully this is not too disturbing. Despite all these bad days last year and before that I made really good progress overall. Unfortunately towards the end of 2020 I gained close to 50lbs in just under two weeks. To anyone saying it's impossible. Well I'm sure the pics above will help you make this statement more reasonable haha. The weight I have gained is all gone in 2021 and some more 💪. So that's nice I guess. 


Anyway, I did achieve that by restricting myself from all kinds of sweets again. Funnily enough I'm studying nutritional science and home economics (B.Sc. Dietetics) and I've learned a lot of helpful things already in just a few months. I mean it is nice to completely cut out any sweets. Your body loves it as the sweets don't do anything for you really. Nontheless this way of dealing with my nutrition is just not sustainable longterm. Originally I had planned to do the no sweets thing during all of 2021. I'm sure that I can do it because I can be very determined but is it really good for me in every aspect!?

Close to valentines day last month I felt a little down for some reason and ended up buying sweets [as you can see here.](https://i.imgur.com/jZFiUo8.jpg)

I didn't even plan on eating them really. I mean the thought of eating all of it at once was on my mind for sure but my willpower was way too strong. Anyway, I know that I have to learn how to deal with those trigger foods in order to beat my disorder. I mean studies show for a good reason that less than 10% of people who lose big amounts of weight will regain. Numbers are actually way worse. But why is that? Many people are saying losing weight isn't the hardest part. It is maintaining a certain weight that is the real challenge. I don't say this to offend anyone who's struggling with weight loss! Losing weight is damn hard already, we all know that!

So but why do people think that maintaining is even harder? I think when you actively decide to lose weight you set rules regarding food and activity to reach a certain weight goal. People are good at understanding that they need to leave out bad foods and create a deficit to lose weight. That's the theory. So let's assume the goal weight was achieved. What comes after that? Most people throw away their weight loss rules as there is no more weight to lose. They stop restricting themselves to certain foods and bad habits are reestablished. Imo this just happens because we don't learn a sustainable way to deal with food. 

Coming back to my case. So I had all those sweets sitting next to me literally and I had no idea what to do with it. It's not like I was sitting there straving for some or even all of it. It was just there. After week 7 of 2021 was finished I told my alright, over the course of the next week you will eat both boxes of cereal. I have never until that day eaten just a part of a box of cereal. Even at 12 years of age I would grab the MEGA box of kelloggs and eat all in one go. I told myself you will have 100g of cereal every day and that's gonna be it. This is exactly what I have done! I have not overeaten during that week. Everything went fine. I even lost weight although there were thoughts of me cheating on my diet on my mind. But nope all good!

The day after that I had half a bag of the Haribo sweets. Writing that down still creates disbelief on my mind lol. Yea I had just had half the bag and the rest for the next day. For last week I did some different testing. In the past even when I was doing well having a cheat day and not just a cheat meal would result in me bingeing for a few days. I think a cheat day creates this thought of being a failure and for me it's really hard to recover from it. So most of the time I would think ah damn it doesn't matter anyway and I keep on bingeing for a few more days. 

So last week I intentionally set myself up for a cheat day. Not a cheat day of bingeing on foods but just a day where I could have whatever I wanted. Obviously I would make sure to have certain foods that I eat like every day to cover mirconutrients. So I knew on either saturday or sunday I would have like 5-10k calories very likely. Working towards that day I cut down on ~400 calories every day. To be fair my maintenance calories are somewhere between 3-3,5k a day (I'm pretty active guy) so 400 isn't all that much actually. Anyway it created a nice little buffer going into the cheat day. 

The cheat day came on sunday and I ended up having almost exactly 7k calories that day. I did weigh myself the next day and I was up like 4lbs or so. For the week I was probably still up a bit so I decided to go with 2k calories on monday and 2,5k calories on tuesday. I stuck to those numbers. My weight is back to normal and actually a little lower than what I weighed on last friday. Even though I had 3,4k calories yesterday. 

This cheat day thing was me testing the water basically. See how I would deal with the situation right now. How it would affect me. I mean it could have thrown me off completely and I would destroy all my hard work again. I think though having planned cheat days is really bad especially while dealing with an eating disorder. So I'll not recommend anyone to do what I did. Adding cheat meals though is completely fine. Just try to stay within your calorie limit. Allowing yourself to have bad foods is completely fine. I learned that while having the cereal every day for a week. My stomach was definately not amused by the sudden intake of sugar every day but it fine in the end.

Something else I want to mention is that implenting an anchoring technique can help a ton with your ED! I Couple weeks ago I had a NLP course and learned some really interesting things. I was basically using that tecnique already. I do a home workout like 6/7 days a week. Obviously motivation can be a problem at times especially when working on certain areas (for me it's back. It's annoying to work your back without being able to use gym machines). So back days are really annoying and my motivation is not the best. Nontheless I kind of implemented some sort of anchor to still make me fo for it almost every day.

Everyday after my workout I'll hav a huge bowl of yoghurt with fruits. Any by huge I mean like 1,5-2,5kg (4-5lbs). [Looks like this.](https://i.imgur.com/ZaSkik8.jpg) This was actually 2,6kg as I had a really busy day and didn't have time for breakfast. I used 1kg of low fat quark, 600g of frozen fruits + 400g of water, 5 bananas (400g), 1 apple (200g), ~20g of walnuts. It tastes amazing. I know after every workout I'll have this super amazing bowl! I personally think rewarding yourself with food is good but obviously the whole thing is super healthy and exactly what my body needs. [Another example of what I have after a workout.](https://i.imgur.com/r321xHM.jpg) This time less yoghurt/quark but 1kg of veggies. I eat like 1kg of fruits and 500g-1kg of veggies every day if someone is curious. 

This actually got a little longer than I like it to be but maybe there's helpful information for anyone. What helped me realising that I do it wrong by restricting myself was a bodybuilder who does youtube content. He is very transparent with what he eats and I was like damn he's having cereal every day and if macros allow it like snickers ice cream in the evening. He really inspired me that you can live in a healthy way even though you allow yourself to have treats here and there. This is exactly what I want. A sustainable, overall healthy way of dealing with food without restrictions regarding certain foods. Having the background of the eating disorder makes this hard of course but not impossible! I'll work hard to get better every day.

As a little conclusion. Our relationship to food should be sustainable to reach longterm success. Treats/bad foods are allowed in certain quantities. Even holidays/birthdays where you might eat more than you usual do can easily be implemented without worries about your progress. I wish everyone here all the best and that all of you reach their goals whatever it is! Nothing is impossible!

I don&amp;#39;t say this to offend anyone who&amp;#39;s struggling with weight loss! Losing weight is damn hard already, we all know that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So but why do people think that maintaining is even harder? I think when you actively decide to lose weight you set rules regarding food and activity to reach a certain weight goal. People are good at understanding that they need to leave out bad foods and create a deficit to lose weight. That&amp;#39;s the theory. So let&amp;#39;s assume the goal weight was achieved. What comes after that? Most people throw away their weight loss rules as there is no more weight to lose. They stop restricting themselves to certain foods and bad habits are reestablished. Imo this just happens because we don&amp;#39;t learn a sustainable way to deal with food. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to my case. So I had all those sweets sitting next to me literally and I had no idea what to do with it. It&amp;#39;s not like I was sitting there straving for some or even all of it. It was just there. After week 7 of 2021 was finished I told my alright, over the course of the next week you will eat both boxes of cereal. I have never until that day eaten just a part of a box of cereal. Even at 12 years of age I would grab the MEGA box of kelloggs and eat all in one go. I told myself you will have 100g of cereal every day and that&amp;#39;s gonna be it. This is exactly what I have done! I have not overeaten during that week. Everything went fine. I even lost weight although there were thoughts of me cheating on my diet on my mind. But nope all good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after that I had half a bag of the Haribo sweets. Writing that down still creates disbelief on my mind lol. Yea I had just had half the bag and the rest for the next day. For last week I did some different testing. In the past even when I was doing well having a cheat day and not just a cheat meal would result in me bingeing for a few days. I think a cheat day creates this thought of being a failure and for me it&amp;#39;s really hard to recover from it. So most of the time I would think ah damn it doesn&amp;#39;t matter anyway and I keep on bingeing for a few more days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last week I intentionally set myself up for a cheat day. Not a cheat day of bingeing on foods but just a day where I could have whatever I wanted. Obviously I would make sure to have certain foods that I eat like every day to cover mirconutrients. So I knew on either saturday or sunday I would have like 5-10k calories very likely. Working towards that day I cut down on ~400 calories every day. To be fair my maintenance calories are somewhere between 3-3,5k a day (I&amp;#39;m pretty active guy) so 400 isn&amp;#39;t all that much actually. Anyway it created a nice little buffer going into the cheat day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheat day came on sunday and I ended up having almost exactly 7k calories that day. I did weigh myself the next day and I was up like 4lbs or so. For the week I was probably still up a bit so I decided to go with 2k calories on monday and 2,5k calories on tuesday. I stuck to those numbers. My weight is back to normal and actually a little lower than what I weighed on last friday. Even though I had 3,4k calories yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cheat day thing was me testing the water basically. See how I would deal with the situation right now. How it would affect me. I mean it could have thrown me off completely and I would destroy all my hard work again. I think though having planned cheat days is really bad especially while dealing with an eating disorder. So I&amp;#39;ll not recommend anyone to do what I did. Adding cheat meals though is completely fine. Just try to stay within your calorie limit. Allowing yourself to have bad foods is completely fine. I learned that while having the cereal every day for a week. My stomach was definately not amused by the sudden intake of sugar every day but it fine in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else I want to mention is that implenting an anchoring technique can help a ton with your ED! I Couple weeks ago I had a NLP course and learned some really interesting things. I was basically using that tecnique already. I do a home workout like 6/7 days a week. Obviously motivation can be a problem at times especially when working on certain areas (for me it&amp;#39;s back. It&amp;#39;s annoying to work your back without being able to use gym machines). So back days are really annoying and my motivation is not the best. Nontheless I kind of implemented some sort of anchor to still make me fo for it almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday after my workout I&amp;#39;ll hav a huge bowl of yoghurt with fruits. Any by huge I mean like 1,5-2,5kg (4-5lbs). &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ZaSkik8.jpg""&gt;Looks like this.&lt;/a&gt; This was actually 2,6kg as I had a really busy day and didn&amp;#39;t have time for breakfast. I used 1kg of low fat quark, 600g of frozen fruits + 400g of water, 5 bananas (400g), 1 apple (200g), ~20g of walnuts. It tastes amazing. I know after every workout I&amp;#39;ll have this super amazing bowl! I personally think rewarding yourself with food is good but obviously the whole thing is super healthy and exactly what my body needs. &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/r321xHM.jpg""&gt;Another example of what I have after a workout.&lt;/a&gt; This time less yoghurt/quark but 1kg of veggies. I eat like 1kg of fruits and 500g-1kg of veggies every day if someone is curious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actually got a little longer than I like it to be but maybe there&amp;#39;s helpful information for anyone. What helped me realising that I do it wrong by restricting myself was a bodybuilder who does youtube content. He is very transparent with what he eats and I was like damn he&amp;#39;s having cereal every day and if macros allow it like snickers ice cream in the evening. He really inspired me that you can live in a healthy way even though you allow yourself to have treats here and there. This is exactly what I want. A sustainable, overall healthy way of dealing with food without restrictions regarding certain foods. Having the background of the eating disorder makes this hard of course but not impossible! I&amp;#39;ll work hard to get better every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a little conclusion. Our relationship to food should be sustainable to reach longterm success. Treats/bad foods are allowed in certain quantities. Even holidays/birthdays where you might eat more than you usual do can easily be implemented without worries about your progress. I wish everyone here all the best and that all of you reach their goals whatever it is! Nothing is impossible! &lt;/p&gt;

So according to MFP, I’ve been logging my food every day for 232 days. I’m feeling pretty bummed out cause I feel I’ve been consistent, I’m using a food scale, I’m trying to overestimate calories when I can’t get an exact measurement. I thought by this time I’d be around 60lbs lost, with my goal being to hit 80lbs lost by the one year mark, but that seems pretty unlikely though. MFP says that as long as I’m eating less than 1800 calories a day then I should be losing about 1 pound a week. I’ve been eating less than that so I can lose faster, but never less than a 1000! Most of the time my weeks average around 1300 - 1500 calories. I found that around the beginning of February/ end of January I had started to plateau at my current weight, so I decided to try to stick more closely to 1400 calories. I’m still stuck. Is it possible that by doing too much of a calorie deficit I’ve stunted my metabolism? I thought even if that was the case cutting more calories would still show some results. I’ll admit I haven’t been the most consistent when it comes to exercise. I find it really hard to exercise regularly all by myself, and no one in my household ever wants to work out or even go for a walk with me. The only exercise I’ve ever really enjoyed doing by myself is swimming, but the pool by my house is still closed. I’ve been trying to do some resistance training, just following along to some YouTube videos, but it leaves me so sore and unmotivated the next day. 
I know the key with all of this is to stick through it, I’m just frustrated. Thought I’d be a lot further along by now than I am. It’s really hard not to compare my progress to some of you guys on here, y’all are doing so good!

I am having trouble finding the motivation and/or willpower to get back on track. A little bit about myself: 

I am 34 years old, 5'8"", and currently at 187lbs. Two years ago, I was at 195lbs and fed up with how I felt/looked. I am not sure what got into my head, but I just decided one day to make a change. I started out just counting calories and walking on the treadmill. I was seeing SMALL changes, but not to my satisfaction. I did my research and decided on a keto diet. I went HARD on keto for 8 months (along with daily exercise - yoga and treadmill) and lost 40lbs. I felt great. I had my days where I missed bread and beer, but I even made it through the holidays without falling off the wagon. At that time, my weight started to plateau, because I got lazy. I found excuses not to work out, and summer was coming, so I wanted to be able to enjoy picnic foods/beer with friends. 

Then, COVID happened. I was working from home and couldn't go out. I sat at home and worked from my couch. I snacked all the time, because it was there. I literally stopped caring about my weight/health because it was easier to be lazy. I continuously was gaining weight, and every once in awhile I'd think ""What am I doing"" and would decide to eat better and exercise. This would last a day or two. Then I'd be back to bad habits. I'm back in the office now, and find myself going to McDs at least 2x a week. Even though I tell myself that morning that this day will be different. 

I am just at a loss right now. I'm at a place where I know I need to get back on the diet/exercise train (my clothes don't fit, I feel sluggish, I don't feel like I look good), but I can't find that motivation/willpower I had before. I don't THINK it's depression (I am diagnosed, but have a steady/working medication management), but that could be a factor. 

I'm just looking for somewhere that I can work with others and share my feelings, goals, accomplishments, and setbacks. I am hoping this is the right place.
