**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

San Mateo, California-based Roblox is among the world's most popular gaming sites for children and offers a host of games across mobile devices and gaming consoles. The reference price is not an offering price to purchase shares but rather will be a performance benchmark for when Roblox's stock starts trading on the stock exchange on Wednesday. The opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers. Roblox has opted to go public through a direct listing rather than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). This means the company is not selling any shares in advance of its market debut, as is the case with IPOs. Direct listings are still relatively rare, though they are becoming increasingly popular way to go public amid criticism that investment banks underwriting IPOs underprice shares being sold to help create a first-day trading ""pop"" for the benefit of their big trading clients. Reuters reported last week that U.S. grocery delivery app Instacart is considering going public through a direct listing, concerned that it could leave money on the table through an IPO. Roblox said in January it had raised around $520 million in a new Series H private fundraising round in a deal which valued it at $29.5 billion, more than seven times the $4 billion the company was valued at in its Series G round 11 months earlier.

There are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** u/bEAc0n) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.

I sent him an email and this was his response

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

&gt;**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**

Edit: apparently people cant bother to even type ""Cede and co"" into the internet. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede\_and\_Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede_and_Company)

&lt;p&gt;There are many great DD&amp;#39;s that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. &lt;strong&gt;However while looking around for DTCC ownership&lt;/strong&gt; and after having found &lt;a href=""http://theoildrum.com/special/archives""&gt;The Oil Drum&lt;/a&gt; (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), &lt;strong&gt;Cede and co&lt;/strong&gt; which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago &lt;strong&gt;(credit:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""/u/bEAc0n""&gt;u/bEAc0n&lt;/a&gt;) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website is run by a &lt;strong&gt;dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income&lt;/strong&gt; and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent him an email and this was his response&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the kind words.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem with your request. Here is the link you should give them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://smithonstocks.com/?s=illegal+naked+shorting""&gt;https://smithonstocks.com/?s=illegal+naked+shorting&lt;/a&gt; (This is Part 10)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is any movement formed to take on illegal naked shorting, I would be happy to contribute. I have been consistently frustrated in trying to get media or politicians interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read part 8 if you want to hear about CEDE and how once a counterfeit share is created it is forever viewed as a legitimate share unless if the company bring all shares back into itself to verify them (basically once counterfeited it exists forever, as a shareholder meet only verifies the shares owned by the ppl who will vote iirc)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. &lt;strong&gt;At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: apparently people cant bother to even type &amp;quot;Cede and co&amp;quot; into the internet. &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede_and_Company""&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede_and_Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: &lt;a href=""/u/rensole""&gt;u/rensole&lt;/a&gt; has commented that he will be looking at this!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 3: I appreciate all of the awards, but go out there and get some GME instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 4: I might disappear in the next few weeks, jks but not jks, so sorry in advance if i die&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 5: Gonna sleep now, its past midnight where I&amp;#39;m at so I gotta get some sleep, leave your comments and dms and I&amp;#39;ll get back to them in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"After a steep pullback in the last couple of weeks, stocks roared back Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq recording its best day since April 2020. The move marked a stark reversal after the index sank into a correction by the close of Monday's session, plunging a total of more than 10% from a recent record closing high. Goes to show how volatile the market can be. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.42% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.10% up.

The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. 

The Treasury yield pulled back a little but remains at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. . Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Courtney Dominguez, Payne Capital Management Senior Wealth Advisor said, “This is a trend that tends to happen as we get out of a recession: You tend to see stocks move towards cyclical. So things like value companies or small caps, things like energy, tend to do really well when you’re coming out of a recession. And what happened last year is, those tech companies were really doing so well that their prices were getting extremely high. I don’t think these companies are going away. I think a lot of these are going to be things that we continue to have in our workplaces going forward. But the question is, are these companies so expensive, is all the optimism already priced in?”

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?&amp;quot; - Li Lu (Had to reuse the quote, so valuable considering how stocks rallied today)&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks," As everyone is well aware, the market has been a wild ride for the past couple weeks, with tech being crushed while ""re-opening"" and other value plays like energy have mostly performed well. We've seen big moves out of the airlines and cruise companies, but I personally feel that Coca-Cola is a stronger re-opening play than either of those.

KO is trading at just under $51 as of today's close, down from its pre-COVID high of $60 last year. The company was hit hard by their consumers being stuck at home for months, unable to dine out and attend sporting events or concerts. Revenue and earnings were down in 2020, and even with vaccines coming out it may still be a while until they return to 2019 levels.

With that being said, Coca-Cola took steps to re-organize their business to become more efficient in order to respond to the pandemic. I think that they can emerge from the pandemic as a more focused business, and once top-line revenues catch back up the company could really see some improvements in their earnings.

Their CEO touched on some of these aspects in their earnings call back in February:

Even with the headwinds they faced in the past year, KO still managed to increase their annual dividend to $1.64, their 39th consecutive annual increase. Of all of the so-called ""reopening plays,"" I feel like KO has not had a huge bounce due to changing investor sentiment. For example, cruise lines like Carnival are issuing new shares just to stay afloat (literally), and are months away from even being able to receive passengers. Yet investors have already pumped their shares 30% in the past month. I understand that KO is only 16% below their pre-COVID high so I'm not expecting a 25% run up out of them in the next month or anything. I'm just surprised that more people don't seem to be getting behind this name. With restrictions being lifted across the country, the amount of Coke products that will be bought at convenience stores, restaurants, and arenas will start to pick up. There's a pent-up demand for people to get out of the house, but not everyone is financially able to book a cruise or plane ticket right now. However, almost anyone can celebrate by taking their family to the local pizzeria or taco place and washing their meal down with a Coke or Sprite. There are hundreds of restaurants in NYC alone that will be increasing their orders for both flavor syrup and bottled drinks now that indoor dining is returning.

With that being said, my plan at the moment is to use a small portion of my portfolio (\~10%) to scoop some shares on the next drop to $50 or below. This would be at least a year hold, to collect the dividend income along with hopefully $5-10 in gains per share. About 70% of my portfolio is loaded to the tits with PLTR (300 @ 32 lol), IPOE, PSTH, and some biotech, so on the recent dip I've been thinking about adding some value plays like KO or COST.

I decided to post a Discussion here rather than go the DD route because I'm not 100% sold on this play myself. If you have any opinions about KO (good or bad) please share! I'm obviously not worried that the stock is gonna tank 50% or anything, but my main fear is that it could trade sideways between $48 and $52 for the next 6 months, and if tech finds some more room to run I'd hate to miss out on those gains.

Second time posting DD ($ON was my first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh6ppx/on_on_semiconductor_analysis/))- please do provide constructive feedback on what other areas you would have looked into / found useful and overall formatting. Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments. There was a lot more research that went into this one as some of the kind commenters identified gaps in my research methodology last time so I have tried to make up for it here.

All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified.

### TL; DR

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.
Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.

2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with

3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.

4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. 

2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.

3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).

4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY. 


Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

### Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

- Price = $13.45
- P/E = -12x
- EPS = -2.12 (dil)
- Forward P/E = 8.5x


# Detailed Analysis

### Bull Considerations

- $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.

- $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).

- Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes^(1) and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).

- The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of &gt; 9%).

- Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.

- Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.


### Bear Considerations

- Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.

- $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.

- $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)

- $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.

- Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.

- Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.

- Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.


### Neutral Considerations

- Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.

- Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.

- Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date^(2). Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (&lt; 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement^(3). I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.

- $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.


### Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.
  - Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025^(4).
  - Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth^(5).
  - Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026^(6).
  - Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

2. Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).
  - VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025^(7). Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
  - Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027^(8). The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres^(9).
  - Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
  - Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027^(10). However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

3. Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.
  - The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022^(11).
  - The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026^(12).
  - The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025^(13). While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

4. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. 
  - Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025^(14). However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%^(15).

5. Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.
  - The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%^(16).
  - Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually^(17).
  - Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021^(18)). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR^(19).
  - Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025^(20).

### Competitive Advantage

1. Adaptive Networking:
 - Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
 - From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&amp;T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either^(21, 22). N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
 - $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route^(23).
 - The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
 - While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&amp;T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

2. Collaboration:
 - Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
 - While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
 - Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

3. Connected Security:
 - Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
 - If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
 - Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

4. Edge Computing:
 - Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
 - As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with &lt;5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
 - An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
 - While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

5. Hybrid Cloud: 
 - Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
 - Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively^(24).
 - If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

&lt;p&gt;All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.
Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price = $13.45&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E = -12x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPS = -2.12 (dil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward P/E = 8.5x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Detailed Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bull Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of &amp;gt; 9%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bear Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Neutral Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (&amp;lt; 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Organisation Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;. However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Competitive Advantage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive Networking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either&lt;sup&gt;21, 22&lt;/sup&gt;. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connected Security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edge Computing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with &amp;lt;5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Cloud: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

,stocks,"iStar (STAR) is a REIT in transition moving assets to their ground leasing company called SAFE. There is a massive mispricing between the two intertwined companies.  **iStar's market cap is $1.3B yet owns $2.5B worth of SAFE** *and* **$3.1B worth of assets yielding 7.9%.** As of Q4, there was only $50M of non-performing assets. This is trading at nearly an 80% discount!

# iStar’s SAFE investment ($2.5B):

iStar created the ground leasing company SAFE in 2017,  which is a REIT that owns ground leases, not buildings.  There is already a lot written about SAFE, so I'm not going to summarize that; instead I'll focus on the mispricing. iStar owns 34.8M shares of SAFE currently valued at $2.5B ($73 / share)( [Slide 11](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008) ). Based solely on iStars SAFE holding, **iStar should trade at $34.25 a share**($2.5B of SAFE/ 74M iStar shares outstanding).

Is SAFE legit? Goldman thinks so with a recently initiated $101 price target (Jan 2021), with a street average of $90 a share. If SAFE reached Goldman’s PT, this would translate to an iStar holding of $3.5B in SAFE. Based on **Goldman’s SAFE Price target**, **iStar should trade at $47.10** a share, some 268% where it trades now.

At this point, the mispricing is so stark that **if you bought $73 of iStar** (i.e. 1 share of SAFE), you would get ***1.93 shares of SAFE***\*, plus iStar’s other underlying assets worth some $3B.\*

# iStar’s Other Assets($3.1B):

iStar breaks out their other lines of business into three buckets:

* Net Lease Consolidated Assets: $2.162B yielding 7.9% ([Slide 12](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Net Lease Venture II: 300M yielding 9% ([Slide 13](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Real Estate Finance Portfolio: $646M at 7.2% ([Slide 15](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report).

In total, they have only $52M of non-performing assets.  These assets total **$3.1B yielding 7.9%.**

# Upcoming catalysts:

I strongly feel it's a matter of time before the market realizes this massive price discrepancy. Here are some possible events:

* Goldman initiated coverage on SAFE on January 27th, 2021. Why not cover iStar if they own 63% of SAFE?
* Three major assets of iStar are Asbury Park, Magnolia Green and Grand Vista. They are looking sell these off over the next 2 years. This would be a massive cash event that could trigger a large iStar share repurchase program.
* iStar has been trying to simplify its message by selling off legacy (though high quality) assets. iStar is nearly complete with this process and plans to begin messaging this year
* SAFE x STAR One-Stop Capital Program was launched in Q4. This combines deals that allow companies to ground lease through SAFE, then allow iStar to offer financing. This could offer some additonal topline growth and further prove their business model is scalable and synergistic between iStar and SAFE going forward.

&lt;li&gt;iStar has been trying to simplify its message by selling off legacy (though high quality) assets. iStar is nearly complete with this process and plans to begin messaging this year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SAFE x STAR One-Stop Capital Program was launched in Q4. This combines deals that allow companies to ground lease through SAFE, then allow iStar to offer financing. This could offer some additonal topline growth and further prove their business model is scalable and synergistic between iStar and SAFE going forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of information already out on iStar and SAFE.  I&amp;#39;m a big believer in the SAFE and iStar business models, though my intention here is to highlight the massive price discrepancy between the two stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

I wanna start by saying kudos to everyone who's holding their stocks!  
Been rough few months but let's all hope that the market comes back sooner than later.

Moving onto my question.... On top of my current portfolio, I've been holding cash aside for a while and I decided to put in another $10K into the market. I'm thinking to put it all into either DIS or AAPL to maximize the gain. I'm looking medium to long term, and I can wear through storms like this one or the COVID crash back in March 2020 as I don't need this cash any time soon. Since my portfolio is already tech heavy, I think DIS makes more sense but I wanted to run it through this sub and pick on your brains. 

Please feel free to share your thoughts! also on my portfolio as well. I won't take any of your inputs as financial advises and will make my own judgements. Thanks so much in advance.

So Fool is running around touting ""640x returns"" based on an ""inflection in the market"", mostly based it seems about an upcoming Tesla announcement on self-driving, plus a bunch of really forward looking stuff. Of course, all this is for $999 and so on.  

I've taken a look at some stocks but I'm not up on the space. On the LIDAR side there's Luminar Technologies (LAZR) seems to be the darling with Velodyne Lidar (VLDR) coming up. There's also Innoviz (CGRO now, INVZ soon), AEye (via CFAC acquisition), ditto Ouster (via CLA).  
The press seems to be that the market is a little crowded and there needs to be a shakeup. I'm guessing Fool will either go with LAZR (because cool) or VLDR (as an up-and-comer)
     
Other possible mentions seem to be STMicroelectronics (STM)

That's as far as I've gone for now, but Fool is pushing this for an event in around 10 days so now would be a good time to get in ahead of the inevitable upswing with Fool subs jumping in.

,stocks,"TACO Earning Report released yesterday afternoon!

Put on your seatbelt and get ready for a very interesting Company Analysis on $TACO!!!

Del Taco Restaurants Inc. is an American fast-food restaurant chain that specializes in American-style Mexican cuisine as well as American foods such as tacos, burritos, fries, nachos, and shakes.

Why was Del Taco’s earning report awesome? Because the C-Suite bought back a bunch of their shares last quarter! Not to mention the C-Suite has not sold a share for over two years! These factors combined with Del Taco serving boatloads of Tacos to increasing their 2020 revenues to match their 2019 revenue levels with fewer stores opened during the pandemic!

With the $1.9 trillion relief package on the horizon and potential talks about marijuana legalization, we may be seeing a demand increase for Fast Food!

Here are the Bull case highlights from yesterdays Earning Report on TACO:

1. Earning report had an **EPS smashing analysts’ estimates by 6 cents** on a per-share basis!!!
2. Only 5.9 million shares of TACO sauce available for General Public purchase. The company repurchased 496,356 shares last quarter! **Low available shares!**
3. Fintel shows Insider ownership of 56.22% with no one selling in the past two years! C-Suite has the biggest Dimond Hands ever!!!
4. 14% short interest reported on earnings day and I predict the shorts will cover out of their positions in the next day or two as the stock is breaking their resistance levels and at its ATH price.

Now for the reason why this has a bullish future!!!

1. Based on the earning report Franchised comparable restaurant sales increased 7.5%! The company is looking to pivot with more franchisees as they bring in the revenue!
2. Del Taco is offering a new “Fresh Flex” Store design recently announced to new franchise owners. Double drive-through lanes, delivery pick-up stations, and dedicated parking lot areas for those who want to park, eat tacos, and go!
3. Del Taco is expanding into Columbus Ohio! Market exposure into Columbus = an increase in their Stores to break 600 store locations this year!
4. Analyst shows a strong buy with a price target of $12.5 on average and $15 high. Currently, there is a **low resistance barrier at $11.71** which should be passed this week!

Bear case

1. The CEO John Cappasola hasn't been very active on PR and has no Twitter to push PR out.
2. There is a low volume on the stocks and the stock has been prone to HF Shorting the stock.

TLDR: Del Taco will be increasing market shares throughout the U.S. starting this year with a new Franchise (Fresh Flex) rollout which will pivot the company and capture more market shares! This is stable stock during times of uncertainty as shown in their 2020 revenue and has a good growth projection!. Great stock to own!

This is not financial advice. I love Tacos, I love the Stock, and I believe TACO stock is extremely undervalued!

Position 75 12.5C Mar 19th (If the stock price increases quickly I will probably sell early near the 25% profit. Otherwise, I'll ride it to Mar 19th and use those earnings to buy more stocks as I believe this stock will keep on its increase projection)",t2_391qiuw,False,,0,False,Review of $TACO stock Earning Report very Bullish future!,[],r/stocks,False,6,,0,,False,t3_m1jf7t,False,dark,0.79,,public,15,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Company Analysis,False,15,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615361222.0,text,6,,,text,self.stocks,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TACO Earning Report released yesterday afternoon!&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Hi all. I have seen some great posts here and I wanted to share some due diligence I have done over the last 24 hours on Avangrid, Inc. (AVG), which I think is poised for a move upward. This is just my personal musing and should not be interpreted, taken, or inferred as financial advice. Full disclosure: I own two March 19, 2021 50 calls and I am considering purchasing shares and more calls.

TL;DR - AGR is one of the larger energy companies in the US, recently received a long awaited environmental impact statement from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (""BOEM"") as to its massive offshore wind farm, and appears to have support of the Biden administration. The company and its stock could be poised for growth and upward movement.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I first learned of this company yesterday while researching the Biden administration's timeline for green energy projects. While doing said research, I came across press releases and news on AGR. The BOEM has finally released the environmental impact statements as to the Vineyard Wind 1 project. It seems that it was being held up by the Trump administration for political reasons. Here is some information from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005701/en/AVANGRID-Offshore-Wind-Joint-Venture-Vineyard-Wind-1-Achieves-Key-Regulatory-Milestone):

&gt; ""AVANGRID, Inc. (NYSE: AGR) confirmed today that the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has issued the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Vineyard Wind 1. The issuance of the FEIS is the final step before a Record of Decision (ROD) from BOEM, the last approval required for construction on the project to begin. The project is under development by Vineyard Wind, a joint venture between Avangrid Renewables, a subsidiary of AVANGRID, Inc., and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP).""  
&gt;  
&gt;""With the issuance of the FEIS, Vineyard Wind confirmed that the project remains on track to reach financial close in the second half of 2021 and begin delivering clean energy to Massachusetts in 2023.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Located 15 miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, Vineyard Wind 1 is slated to become the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the United States. With a generating capacity of 800 megawatts (MW), the project will provide enough electricity to power more than 400,000 homes and businesses in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts...""

It seems like AGR has plans to build other offshore wind farms:

&gt;""In addition to Vineyard Wind 1, Avangrid Renewables is a partner on Park City Wind, an 800 MW project to serve the state of Connecticut, as well as on additional lease areas off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island to deliver up to 3,500 MW. Avangrid Renewables also is developing Kitty Hawk Offshore Wind that has the potential to deliver 2,500 MW of clean energy into Virginia and North Carolina.""

There is also AGR's acquisition of PNM. AGR has recently been [moving to purchase](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210212005493/en/PNM-Resources-Shareholders-Approve-Proposed-AVANGRID-Merger) a large energy producer in New Mexico. I will not hazard a guess as to how this will affects the share price, but according to the above article:

&gt;""AVANGRID announced the strategic PNM Resources merger combination in October 2020 in an all cash offer for PNM Resources’ shares at $50.30 per share, an $8.3 billion enterprise value transaction. The resulting entity would be one of the major clean energy companies in the US with ten regulated utilities in six states and the third largest renewables company with operations in 24 states.  
&gt;  
&gt;'Approval by PNM’s shareholders is an important step toward realizing this strategic transaction. Our two companies share the same values and we are passionate about our customers, employees, and the communities we serve,' said Dennis V. Arriola, CEO of AVANGRID.""

Some of the financial data I pulled from Nasdaq today:

\*\*P/E Ratio\*\*25.7

\*\*Forward P/E 1 Yr.\*\*21.33

\*\*Earnings Per Share(EPS)\*\*$1.88

\*\*Annualized Dividend\*\*$1.76

Thus, unlike a lot of typical green energy growth stock, AGR is already profitable and pays a dividend.

According the head of the National Ocean Industries Association President quoted in this [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/03/08/biden-climate-windfarm/), it seems like offshore wind could end up being a huge area, with the potential for $160 billion worth of investments over the next fifteen years:

&gt;""Monday’s announcement drew praise from industry. National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito said it was “critical for the project developers and for the offshore wind industry as a whole.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Milito called on the administration to move even faster, noting that it has been two years since the last federal offshore wind lease sale. He noted that a recent analysis suggested near-term lease opportunities could generate more than $160 billion in new investment over the next 15 years, but that Interior’s Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management “must first open the door to new leasing.”

I like the dividend, the potential for growth, and the alignment with the current political climate. I am mulling whether to buy shares in addition to trading the options. The one concern for me as a long-term investment, however, is that the P/E ratio is still a little high for my taste. I generally avoid ""growth stocks"" in my investment portfolio. I am on the fence.

Canoo’s last S-1 was filed almost two months ago, but I hadn’t read it until tonight. I did read the one available in August, and shared [my research](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/j6u367/canoo_is_on_to_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) in October.

After wrapping my mind around the subtle, positive changes in messaging in their latest filing, and the [impending premiere of Canoo's newest vehicle](https://www.reddit.com/r/goev/comments/m0og3t/canoogoev_pickup_truck_world_premiere_march_11th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I'm considering what may be the most interesting question the company has forced us to ponder in months:

When did the pick-up truck become the next thing?

We’ve seen it in a few renderings, and [Tony mentioned it was coming back in December](https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-electric-canoo/canoo-reveals-electric-delivery-van-plans-for-pickup-microfactories-idUSKBN28R21Q), but it hasn’t ever been included on their roll-out schedule.

That order has always been:

* Consumer Van (short-term lease/subscription, 2022)
* B2B/MPDV (sales, 2023)
* Sedan (short-term lease/subscription, 2024 or 25)

And that’s how it was reflected [in the company’s latest prospectus](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-001996/fs12021_canooinc.htm), which was published in early January. It discusses (as it did in August), the three offerings listed above in meaningful detail, but never mentions the truck. [It wasn’t discussed in the investor presentation either](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_75917b64e8f13bc03dbc9e3230eeade6/canoo/db/1087/9680/pdf/HCAC+Canoo+-+Investor+Presentation+-+FINAL.pdf).

Which made me wonder:

* Why is the truck being revealed before the sedan?
* Is it going to be *released* before the sedan?
* If so, why the change? Was it due to a commercial order?
* Or is it simply because they believe they’ll move more units across segments with two vans (B2C and MPVD) and a truck than they could with a sedan in it’s place?

The reality is, we won’t know the answer to any of those questions until the event wraps up on Thursday (at the earliest), but it's fun to think about, and based on the conclusions I'm drawing while going through this exercise, I suspect we’ll end up appreciating at least a few of the answers that eventually come our way.

———

Here are a few quotes from the S-1 that add credibility to the notion that this truck roll-out could be the result of a pressing market opportunity that Canoo recently decided to take advantage of:

“We are actively exploring \[new\] market opportunities and will continue to carefully assess and pursue \[them\] as they become available.”

and

“In addition to this current planned vehicle lineup, we have evaluated and continue to evaluate the consumer and commercial vehicle markets, including projected trends and developments, to identify new areas of demand and product opportunities. Our skateboard platform uniquely positions us to efficiently allocate capital to meet current and evolving demand and margin opportunities by allowing us to quickly adjust volumes and add new product derivatives.”

———

And here are a handful of statements from the latest S-1, that produce questions we're all looking forward to gaining answers to:

* “We are \[currently\] in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging our technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.” Who?
* “We are in advanced discussions with several parties regarding the licensing of our skateboard and other technology.” Who and what other technology?
* “Our skateboard platform and our steer-by-wire and centralized computing architecture make us uniquely positioned to take advantage of continuing advancements in autonomous vehicle technology. We are in discussions with some of the most prominent companies pursuing this technology.” Who?
* “We are also in discussions with a number of other partners and expect to be in a position to announce many more partnerships in due course.” Who and when?
* “We and a potential contract manufacturing partner have been working together on vehicle designs for manufacturability and production planning since early 2018.” Still focused on contract manufacturing in most current S-1, but Tony mentioned micro-factories in December.

,stocks,"I'm quite sure if I posted this on any WSB-related thread I'd get blasted with death threats and insults about my rationale.

ELI5:  The last two days of GME/AMC movement seems to be driven by something other than a hedge squeeze. Volume is 1/5th of previous squeeze, order flows for GME per Fidelity is NET NEGATIVE (meaning more selling than buying) and for GME, near break even. Maybe, if we're lucky, we continue to see green for another day or two, but I have a bad feeling about a rug incoming, and it's going to be quick and sudden. 

The same goes for the energy sector with TSLA, NIO, XPENG among others. They've been beaten down and I don't see any reasonable shift towards such heavy green across the board.

,stocks,"I've been seeing conflicting descriptions of what happens with wash sales recently and thought it would be good for this community to clarify what happens in different situations.

It seems like everyone understands that if you buy a stock 30 days after selling for a loss, that loss isn't deductible. However, there seems to be confusion over the tax implications of subsequent actions. 

Let's say you originally buy 100 shares of a stock at $100. You then sell those shares at $80, for a $2000 loss. If you rebuy within 30 days, I think most people understand that the $2000 loss is not deductible and instead gets added to your cost basis.

Let's say you rebuy 100 shares within 30 days at a price of $70. Your cost basis should now be $7000 + $2000 = $9000.

Now, let's say the stock drops again and you sell at $60. This is where there seems to be confusion about what is deductible.

My understanding is that the new loss would be $6000 - $9000 = $3000, due to the increased cost basis. 

***QUESTION 1***: Is this $3000 loss is deductible, despite the original wash sale? 

I've been assuming yes, but I see a lot of people that suggest it isn't deductible. Is it correct that deductible losses are always determined from the cost basis at the most recent sale (ignoring long-term vs short-term issues)? I keep seeing people say that the deduction cannot include losses from previous wash sales, but if that is true, why would the wash sale increase the cost basis? I thought that was the point of the increased cost basis.

There are horror stories of people making $200k in taxable gains that they lost entirely through wash sales, making them owe taxes on the $200k despite losing it all. Couldn't that only occur if a wash sale occurred within 30 days of a new year, or if they never closed their position after a wash sale? As long as you sold before the new year and didn't rebuy, this couldn't happen, could it?

***QUESTION 2:*** Is a wash sale a reason to never rebuy a stock within 30 days?

I've frequently see people say ""I sold at a loss, so I have to wait 30 days to buy back in otherwise I can't deduct the loss."" Isn't this true only if they don't resell that same year, or if they create another wash sale in January? Basically, I'm seeing people wait to get back in on a rising stock simply because it is within 30 days. If you want to be be able to deduct the current loss within this tax year, then sure, that makes sense to wait. However, if you don't mind risking pushing that deduction to a later time, doesn't it make much more sense to buy back in if you think the stock will continue rising? I'm basically seeing people deciding to not rebuy a stock because they are afraid they won't ever be able to deduct a loss.

**QUESTION 3:** Ignoring long-term vs short-term gains/losses, can't you always *eventually* deduct an equivalent amount regardless of wash sales? 

Basically, because the cost basis gets adjusted with wash sales, aren't those losses always included when you close your position, either resulting in decreased profits, or increased losses. If so, is there anything critical missing in the suggestion: ""don't rebuy within 30 days if you want to deduct the loss within the current year.""

I started buying around $64 a share, kept buying into the high 80s, also own a bunch of ITM and OTM calls for 2022/2023, recently started selling ATM naked puts for those dates as well.  It's my 3rd largest position after Apple and Google.  My post isn't to pump the stock, I'd love for it to keep going lower so I can keep buying more LEAPS, but I'd love to hear some arguments as to why my thesis is wrong so I can have some differing viewpoints.

Buying Sony today to me feels like buying Apple in 2013.  ""No revenue growth, one trick pony, no innovation, etc.""  This is what they used to say about Apple in 2013.  I disagreed and plowed 80% of my net worth into Apple.  At the time, Apple was trading between 11-13 PE.  That seemed extremely cheap to me for a company that is part of a duopoly on a product that people are addicted to and will stare at for 8+ hours a day.  

Sony is currently trading near a 12-13 PE with close to 45b cash on hand and barely any debt. Ex cash they are trading under a 10 PE.  They haven't had much revenue growth the past years, but I expect that to change being at the beginning of a new console cycle. They are killing earnings and you can't even find the PS5 in store. They makes a device that people are addicted to. Like Apple, they get a 30% cut off the software that other people make to run on their device. They are part of a duopoly/triopoly and are the dominant player.

Sony is much more than just Playstation.  Their company is hitting on all cylinders in movies, music, image sensors, etc, but I focus on gaming because that's where I see the real potential.  If Playstation was its own entity trading on the Nasdaq, would it not garner at least a $200 billion valuation?  10x sales is not that much for a company growing at the clip that PS network services has been the last few years.  And yet here we are, with Sony's total valuation ex cash sitting at 50% of that.

Gaming is still in its infancy.  NES in 1985 was the first time gaming became mainstream. Investing in gaming now is akin to investing in Ford in the 1950s.  Sony's biggest mistake was not selling the PS5 for $699 because it's clear that many people will pay that, but I still think they are setup very well for the future.  I would pay 127B market cap for Playstation division alone, everything else that Sony produces is just icing on the cake.

**Apple Inc’s** [AAPL 3.53%](https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ) smartphones are set to get camera upgrades in 2022 and 2023 that will make them more robust and increase their shooting capability, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, AppleInsider [reported](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/09/kuo-unibody-lens-coming-to-iphone-in-2022-periscope-lens-in-2023) Tuesday.

**What Happened:** The iPhone will come with a “unibody” design in 2022 which will integrate the voice coil motor of its camera and the lens array, according to Kuo.

This move could free up internal space in the device and increase the robustness of the smartphone made by the Tim Cook-led company, according to AppleInsider.

Apple plans to add a telephoto camera on its high-end iPhones from a 6P lens array to a 7P stack in 2022 as well. 

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant is reportedly planning to move all its rear-facing iPhone lenses to the 7P stack in the coming years. 

The analyst said that, in 2023, Apple will introduce a telephoto lens design to the iPhone. This type of design helps to extend the focal length of a compact lens array, as per AppleInsider.

**Why It Matters:** Kuo had previously made the prediction regarding the telephoto lens design and given a timeline of 2022.

According to Kuo, Apple will also fine-tune iPhone’s optics this year and make the move from glass to plastic cover materials for Face ID.

The company also plans to add a new telephoto lens to its high-end models which will come with a 6P lens stack, an improvement from the 5P design found currently, as per Kuo.

Another green day for both the stocks. I would love to hear everyone's opinion on this, and I want evidence and new thoughts. NOT ""dey bof r gr33n so dey follo eachofer rocketshipemoji""

I believe no, we are not pumping because of them. Correlation =/= causation.

While BB is still on their watch list (you can see this from [https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/) chart he posted), I don't believe they are following each other due to the lack of volume BB has. I believe more that this is a dead-cat bounce due to being oversold (4/10 days have been red, prior to today), big institutions are averaging up (6 of the top 6 institution holders from [https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb) have all confirmed bought more shares, you can see this here by searching their names [https://fintel.io/so/us/bb](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb)), and the incredible amount of good news that's been released from $BB. The two press releases today premarket I'd recommend checking out.

To add to this, a large portion of stimulus checks from the US government is going to be added to stocks based on this article from CNBC [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/how-the-young-plan-to-spend-stimulus-checks-deutsche-bank.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/how-the-young-plan-to-spend-stimulus-checks-deutsche-bank.html)

How factual this statistic is, is hard to say. I believe BB is going to show a lot of strength and we could potentially have seen the bottom and we will finally see the crab pattern we've been waiting for.

DYOD. I'm not your financial advisor, I'm just another moron who eats red crayons but enjoys the green ones when given the opportunity. One time I ran out of lube for my Betty White fleshlight so I used carpenters glue instead. Feelsbadman.

Take care.

I believe more that this is a dead-cat bounce due to being oversold (4/10 days have been red, prior to today), big institutions are averaging up (6 of the top 6 institution holders from &lt;a href=""https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb""&gt;https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb&lt;/a&gt; have all confirmed bought more shares, you can see this here by searching their names &lt;a href=""https://fintel.io/so/us/bb""&gt;https://fintel.io/so/us/bb&lt;/a&gt;), and the incredible amount of good news that&amp;#39;s been released from $BB. The two press releases today premarket I&amp;#39;d recommend checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to this, a large portion of stimulus checks from the US government is going to be added to stocks based on this article from CNBC &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/how-the-young-plan-to-spend-stimulus-checks-deutsche-bank.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/how-the-young-plan-to-spend-stimulus-checks-deutsche-bank.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How factual this statistic is, is hard to say. I believe BB is going to show a lot of strength and we could potentially have seen the bottom and we will finally see the crab pattern we&amp;#39;ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DYOD. I&amp;#39;m not your financial advisor, I&amp;#39;m just another moron who eats red crayons but enjoys the green ones when given the opportunity. One time I ran out of lube for my Betty White fleshlight so I used carpenters glue instead. Feelsbadman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Fixed some stuff. Also AMC is now trading above BB lol, look at the 1 month chart. AMC has pumped way harder than BB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT2: 10:32 Mountain time, Someone bought 650k shares.&lt;br/&gt;
EDIT3: 10:33 Mountain time, someone bought an additional 1.4 million shares. What in the fuck &lt;/p&gt;

Can you even imagine? Having that much of an advantage in regards to content and using that for your favour?

Can you even name 2 people sitting on the board of directors at your holdings? Head of Pepsi once replaced Jobs as CEO and it didn't end well. Company was dire for a change, very rapid one because he lacked vision. 

Apple will always adapt to the market, they will manufacture whatever consumers adapted widely from competition and they will simply make it better (mobile payments, VR Glasses in the future). 

Paramount had every single edge of advertising and brining eyes to their streaming service yet - they failed. And in my eyes that was free money and they shouldn't succeed with their streaming business. They could milk that interview so hard and yet - they showed a big middle finger to investors holding that garbage stock. 

Side note - we wanted to cut the cord, now we pay 7x what we used to for TV - most diversified streaming companies are going to win. I have to pay 250$ a month for my family plans so everyone can watch what they want, really? 

If management lacks vision - goodbye company. Maybe not today, not in 5 years, but people are holding stocks for 13-25 years having incredible gains but management has to stay on top of the game. Look deeply into whats happening behind closed doors. Insider trading is meaningless. One guy buys a yacht, second one has too much cash so he buys in, WE NEVER KNOW. 

I always start from lurking around LinkedIN, this is a crucial part of my DD to understand who will take care of my money. 

P/Es, technical analysys etc. - it's all very important but it wont protect you from long term stupidity of rich assholes not caring about the future. Hold your management accountable, ask questions during investor calls. 

I asked $VECO if they are going to enter semiconductor business, CFO made huge eyes and CEO responded with blunt date of 2027. I asked about using GaN (it's used in next-gen powerbanks and cables, better than lithium) in commercial products (they are in enterprise), also blunt response - sold that stock on the next market bell.

,stocks,"A lot of people (including my parents and me) suffered after 2008. We often hear ppl losing everything and getting set far back in lives. What we DON'T often hear, are people who loaded up in 2008. Regular average people. Those with small savings. Be it stocks or the housing market (which experienced a trailing small crash 2 years after). Those folks got literally everything on a massive discount.

Think about it from that angle. If I have SOME money saved up now and it were 2008 again, I would be fkin ecstatic. Because after 4-5 years I would gain 1000% easily. And that's not even going into real estate.

Also, recent example of last March will confirm my point. I made huge gains from it. I only bought Costco, Etsy and HomeDepot. No technical analysis. No charts. No graphs. Nothing. They were on sale and I assume people will be using them during the pandemic. Average intelligent move. There was no depth to it.

And even if you don't maximize your portfolio, literally buying any stocks on the dip will make you money in the long run. You can be dense and still make money.

So chill tf out. The dip IS AN OPPORTUNITY. It's a fking GIFT.

We're all familiar with ""buy the dip"". Well, here's the same principles with a minor tweak ""buy the (big) dip"".

There are 3 things for certain: death, tax and the stock market going up in the long run

**How does it work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth.

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock: UWM Holdings ($UWMC)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: +1286.9%

Month on Month increase in mentions: +2762%

Average sentiment across mentions: **+21.83%**

**Core Product**

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers. Instead, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they mainly provide is consumers, lenders and institutions a simple process by which they can apply, compare and complete a mortgage application. They currently have one of the fastest and most effective consumer to lender processes due to their heavy investments into IT infrastructure (UWMC’s mortgage process takes an average of 17 days from start to finish when compared to the industry average of 47 days)

**Financials**

UWM had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.

UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. Their total loan volume amount for 2020 was $182.5B which was 69% higher than 2019.

Cash in hand also rose from 133M in 4Q-19 to 1.22B in 4Q-20. Credit quality of the loans improved with the weighted average FICO of 757 for the full year of 2020. This brought down the 60+ delinquency rates well below the industry average. UWMC also just declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

Russell index addition: UWMC is expected to be added into Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 index by end of March. This will force all the funds tracking these indices to add UWMC to their portfolio possibly driving the stock price higher.

Technology moat: UWMC invests heavily in IT infrastructure and technology. They develop all their technology with in-house developers. They have developed tools such as Blink+, UWM InTouch, and Brand 360 which enables them to have an industry-leading close time (almost twice as fast as Rocket and 3x as fast as the industry average)

Short interest: While the company is in no way similar to the GME case in short interest (140% which was a very rare event), it still is at 31% which is significantly higher than average. (source: fintel.io)

NPS score: They currently have the happiest customers among their competition with an NPS score 16% higher than that of Rocket (which is at 2nd place).

**Risk and Competition**

75% of the mortgage volume was based on refinancing ($42.9B new mortgages, $139.3B refinancing). This is predominantly driven by declining mortgage rates. If the mortgage rates increase, then UWMC’s refinancing volume will take a significant hit bringing down their revenues.

There is a lot of discussion around this being one of the reasons UWMC went public so as to capitalize on the refinance boom. I don’t completely buy this argument as company executives themselves are solidifying their position (Director of $UWMC just reported his SEC form 4, showing he more than doubled his own position on March 1st, from 50k to 110k shares).

The full impact of UWMC’s CEO's surprise announcement that they wouldn’t work with mortgage brokers that work with Rocket or Fairway Independent Mortgage is still not clear. UWMC has said that the split will take effect from March 15th.

**Conclusion**

This is the first time in my experience that a trending stock that has solid fundamentals is generating revenue, is profitable, and has no debt. Although there are some risks in terms of mortgage rates and the surprise announcement, I think the current market conditions put UWMC in a very strong position as a long-term play.

Long on SABR, the IT backend with full exposure to travel industry recovery. Revenue closely correlates with traveler count. Stock is poised for a short squeeze with 20% short interest.

\---

With the USA vaccine plan in full swing and the estimates of enough vaccines for all adults by May, travel stonks had a huge boost in confidence. With the summer travel season coming in hot, people are flocking to all kinds of travel stocks: airlines, cruises, hotels, casinos, etc. One that has been flying under the radar is $SABR, the Global Distribution System IT backend that services ALL these industries and benefits directly from increased travel numbers. As travel increases, their revenue directly correlates. In a nutshell, I like this stock for multiple reasons, including a position unique to SABR: a 20% short interest. As the population with immunization increases, pent up travel demand should cause a huge influx of leisure travel. IMO, I think the amount of leisure travel will exceed 2019’s as the world opens back up. Also, SABR is a better reopening play than airliners because business travel loss does not affect them as much.

# What is Sabre Technology?

Market Cap: 4.776B

Total Share Float: 317M

Institutional Ownership: 105% (yep, that’s higher than the float)

Sabre provides the infrastructure that allows major ticketing and booking sites to operate. They provide the data that allows sites like Expedia and Google Travel, and many others to operate. Their customer base includes:

· Expedia: Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotels.com, Tripadvisor.com, SeatGuru.com, Cheaptickets.com

· Booking: Kayak, Agoda, Priceline, CheapFlights, Momondo, OpenTable, RentalCars

· Google Flights and Hotels

· Hilton Worldwide

· Marriot

· Hyatt Hotels

· Caesars Entertainment

Essentially, they cover 35% market share of all travel booking transactions. Competitors include Travelport (not public), and Amadeus (mainly European travel). So, if you want a “picks and shovels” company with heavy exposure to the Northern Hemisphere’s travel industry, this would fit the bill. Another fantastic move they made at the start of 2020 was partnering with Google Cloud to create an AI driven solution that should create more value for their clients, while reducing overhead. The Sabre Travel AI development will be launching this year and bodes well for the technical moat that they are building. The fruits of this partnership should manifest in the coming years.

# Recovery Projections

Due to the close correlation between travelers and Sabre’s revenue, I took the liberty of modeling out the two datasets of Price and Travelers relative to each other.

[https://i.imgur.com/jJbmNRa.png](https://i.imgur.com/jJbmNRa.png[/img])

The correlation is relatively strong, and even demonstrate a breakout in speculation in the recent months due to positive vaccine news. As the number of travelers increase, a reversion to the mean should continue to carry the stock price upwards. I’m pretty bullish on the trend and think there’s plenty of upside to go in Q2 and Q3 of 2021. My price target is **$22** by end of year.

# But What about Business Travel?

The amount of total business travelers is expected to drop in the coming years as people realize they can sit in their bedroom on Zoom and not even put on pants while working. This is true, and SABR is pretty well positioned to handle it. Business travelers account for 12% of airlines’ passengers but drive more profit due to memberships and amenities. In some cases, they represent 75% of certain airlines’ revenues. So decreased business travel is absolutely brutal to airline companies. However, even if 12% of travelers never come back, SABR can shrug it off. Because their revenue correlates with **QUANTITY of travelers** **and not quality.** Looking at the above graph, even at a sustained average of 2M travelers, SABR share price should be trading around $20. For this reason, SABR is a better reopening play than airliners.

# Short Interest of 20%

For reasons that still elude me, Sabre has a relatively high short interest that continue to pile up, despite many signs of recovery. There are currently **61.3M shares sold short, with a total float of 317M.** Considering the daily volume of **\~6M**, we are looking at a situation where shorts will take **10 days to cover the entire position.** The smaller the daily volume, the more difficult it is for shorts to cover their position without causing a spike in price. This means that **SABR** **is poised for a short squeeze**. It may not happen violently like what we saw in some other meme stocks, but at the very least, it may cause natural buying pressure over time as the shorts unwind.

# Bear Case

The risk factors include:

· New debt from 2020 debt offerings and refinancing

· Share dilutions in the amount of \~$500 million

· $4.74B of long term debt (64.85M is current debt, which is easily covered with $1.5B in cash reserves)

· Delay in travel reopening, or more crazy COVID news

· Lower than expected travelers returning. Business travel is expected to decrease, but it impacts SABR far less than airliners.

Ultimately, this is a bet on the travel reopening. This is not financial advice, etc. Do your own due diligence and come to your own decision on what to do here. If you have issues with the DD, please poke some holes in it and let me know your bear case.

It may not happen violently like what we saw in some other meme stocks, but at the very least, it may cause natural buying pressure over time as the shorts unwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bear Case&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk factors include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· New debt from 2020 debt offerings and refinancing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Share dilutions in the amount of ~$500 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· $4.74B of long term debt (64.85M is current debt, which is easily covered with $1.5B in cash reserves)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Delay in travel reopening, or more crazy COVID news&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Lower than expected travelers returning. Business travel is expected to decrease, but it impacts SABR far less than airliners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is a bet on the travel reopening. This is not financial advice, etc. Do your own due diligence and come to your own decision on what to do here. If you have issues with the DD, please poke some holes in it and let me know your bear case.&lt;/p&gt;

**Nio is the undervalued EV play to consider in this dip.**

# Introduction

Let's get started. If this looks too long for you, please know that half of it is literally pictures. Just gonna say right here that I'm not going to be detailing this down to the point of analyzing every car model the company sells, even though it's probably important. Mainly because I'm lazy and don't want to write that much, but I am for sure no expert in cars at all and I don't have the qualifications to lecture you on car models. Maybe some car genius in the comments will. Also, I'm not gonna be discussing sector rotation or whatever. Figure out how to play it if based on your market thesis. Alright enough chit chat let's get to business.

Keep in mind the recent price range: $38-31

**Company Biography:**

NIO Limited designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The company offers five, six, and seven-seater electric SUVs. It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing, design, and technology development activities; manufacture of e-powertrains, battery packs, and components; and sales and after sales management activities. In addition, the company offers charging solutions, including Power Home, a home charging solution; Power Swap, a battery swapping service; Power Mobile, a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger, a public fast charging solution; and Power Express, a 24-hour on-demand pick-up and drop-off charging service. Further, it provides value-added services, such as statutory and third-party liability insurance, and vehicle damage insurance through third-party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance, as well as data packages. NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8, a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV.

So to summarize:

\- Sells and Manufactures a variety of luxury cars

\- Offers a multitude of charging solutions

\- Offers BaaS (Battery as a subscription service, meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car but we'll get to that later)

\- Provides vehicle damage insurance, statutory and third-party liability insurance (Statutory meaning its required by law to own)

\- Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance, and data packages

Now that's a handful and we don't have all day, so we'll primarily be focusing on the main event which is their car line and BaaS. This does not mean you should disregard the other packages when viewing it as an investment, it just means I'm too lazy to do research on the other things.

&amp;#x200B;

# Market and Competition

**Market**

Honestly pretty much everyone knows where the EV market is heading and how it's the future, but it's worth mentioning regardless.

The EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21%, and hit 30 Million Cars worldwide by 2030. By 2026, worldwide EV revenue is expected hit roughly half a trillion USD, or $500 Billion. (Also, for those who aren't sure what a CAGR is, it means that the market on average is expected to grow by 21%. Not overall, but 21% year by year; take a second to appreciate the compound growth effect that will occur.) What's more, is that the Asia Pacific market (Where NIO primarily is) is reported to have the fastest growth. Here's a graph that represents these projections.

If we take a more specific look to NIO's market, analysts have recently upgraded previous forecasts, now claiming that 20% of the vehicle fleet will be EV by 2025. Beyond that, the forecasts for 2035 and 2050 are 53% and 80% penetration, respectively.

**Strategy**

The Chinese EV market has quite a few players on the board, so strategy is pretty important to differentiate and forge a unique business model. Nio's strategic goal is to have a consistent, stable order flow, rather than a fluctuating order backlog similar to Tesla. (Courtesy of J.P Morgan) By keeping pricing steady, Nio's focus lies on services and customer experience driving a positive reputation in the community and keeping engagement high; it also allows gross and vehicle margin to find stable ground as volumes rise.

We could also discuss their consumer relationship, and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out. [Apparently](https://web.archive.org/web/20210110170556if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kucf6r/chinese_autist_here_gonna_share_you_western/) Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla, but I don't have the experience to confirm that. Regardless, between their own app for owners, special owner events, and communal spaces, it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base.

BaaS. Battery as a Service. Or rather, a subscription. Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner, electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs. This shaves off roughly $10,000 off the price of their vehicles, which in turn boosts Nio's price competitiveness and demand. Also, BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far, and these swapping stations even support the EV's of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV's makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. You may be thinking, does this benefit the consumer in anyway? Sure it does. The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs. Some people aren't able to have their own home charging stations; many don't even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily. Also, consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can't afford to bleed money on certain battery solution, downgrade. Going on a large roadtrip? No problem, just rent a larger battery size. However, the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation. Instead of being stuck with a dated or low-end battery, all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery. What does this mean? Well, basically you don't need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute. Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack, and one size fits all. This improves resale value, and provides a future proof battery system. Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later), but I'm personally a fan because it's very pro-consumer, improves brand visibility (There's hundreds of these things and other EV's can use them attracting more traffic), and offers Nio Inc. another revenue stream. To recap: Extra revenue stream, easy to scale, brand visibility, and very pro-consumer.

Another thing that's worth mentioning is that the Chinese government favors BaaS companies when it comes to benefits, so there's that too.

**Catalysts**

I don't actually have a lot of research in this area, so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I'll add it in.

\- European Market Expansion

\- Rapid Clean Tech Movement

\- New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors

\- NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year

\- Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road. This is pure speculation, but here's an article written by [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-chinese-ev-maker-nio-might-be-coming-to-america-51612892800) claiming that Nio Inc. has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U.S. Market.

**Local environment**

Let's take a quick peek at Nio's infrastructure. As previously mentioned, they've chosen to offer battery as a subscription service, or BaaS for short. Now, we've already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice, but how well are they executing? As of right now, NIO currently has roughly 143 battery changing stations in China, and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more. Additionally, they've partnered with the Chinese state's grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations.

This all sounds great, right? We've discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they've established. There is of course, a predictable drawback that I should mention. Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way, other markets that lack China's battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into, because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio-power network that allows for battery swapping. Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets, because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas. Anyway, let's move on.

Now as you probably know, NIO is a China based EV company. Why is that a good thing exactly? Well, here's why. The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.  On top of that, China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world, and even further, they're the largest investor in renewable energies. OK, IDGAF where's the relation to cars? It's not super concrete, but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China's firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy. They've been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy, so you know they'll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible. Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals, and how large the Chinese EV market is/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow. Actually, let's take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts.

\- China is the *largest* EV market in the world, representing roughly *50%* of worldwide sales.

\- From 2019 to 2020, Chinese EV sales increased *550%,* from 200,00 units to 1,300,000 units.

\- China expects sales to grow nearly *40%* this year despite the pandemic, growing from 1,300,000 units to over 1,800,000 units.

Between these statistics and China's firm stance on clean tech and the EV market, we can conclude that NIO's local environment is well suited for growth and stability.

# Financials and Numbers

Not gonna do much talking here, just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will.

**Q4 Positive Highlights and Outlook**

* Q4 Revenues grew 46.7% Quarter over Quarter, reaching $1.02 Billion, while many expected $1.04 Billion.
* Deliveries reached 17,000 Units for Q4. For reference they sold 40,000 units in 2020.
* NIO projects 20,000+ Units for Q1 of 2021, which is 15% quarter over quarter. Again, for reference they sold 40,000 units for 2020. What's more is that in Q1 2020, they only sold 4k cars but in Q1 2021 they're projected to do **400%** that number a year later. This type of growth is probably the most appealing aspect to potential investors the way I see it.
* Gross and Vehicle Margin grew to 17.2%
* NIO generated positive cash-flow
* Despite the tech restraints from battery/chip shortages, management says production levels will be able to remain 'normal'
* Even with the production constraints through Q2, NIO's outright delivery and revenue growth are visible - the company is on track to deliver nearly the same amount of cars in Q1/Q2 as it had in 2020.
* NIO trades at about 13.1x projected FY21 revenues

**Q4 Negative Highlights**

* Due to the Semiconductor/Chip Shortage, NIO is expecting a bit of a bump in the road in terms of deliveries in the early half of the year
* With the combination of chip and battery constraints, NIO expects monthly production through Q2 to cap around \~7,500 units,  a 25% decrease from Q1 projections.
* Net Loss for Q4 clocked in at $1.3 Billion USD
* Operating Losses weren't reduced a whole lot
* Missed EPS estimates
* No dividend

# Investment Outlook

**Analyst Consensus**

Need a third opinion? This is one of the **biggest green flags** IMO. These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is. Here's a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks. Please keep in mind NIO's recent price activity: 31-38 (As of Mar. 5)

Price targets:

\- HSBC: $49

\- Morgan Stanley: $80

\- J.P. Morgan: $75

\- Deutsche: $70

\- Bank of America: $70

\- Goldman Sachs: $64

\- Daiwa: $100

**Conclusion**

Obviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic, especially the Asia Pacific market, but I'm also a big fan of their strategic approach. Feel free to debate me on that. I've also heard a lot of praise regarding their management, seen a lot of fans of [William Li](https://www.forbes.com/profile/william-li/?sh=894e17911a13), calling him a genius and the 'Elon Musk of China'. There's a couple things I've missed in this DD; I probably should've touched on the competition, their other services/packages, and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles, but I'm really no expert in those fields so I'll leave that to others.

For this thesis, I think it's important to keep in mind how much the price has dipped recently. I mean within the past month it's been as high as 61, and as low as 31. EV's have taken a beating in these red days, and may even continue to decrease. I personally find any prices under 35 extremely appealing, but that general sub 40 area is pretty solid IMO. Hell, it almost went sub 30 on the 5th. I primarily like the growth opportunity Nio presents, especially when considering the discount its been at. It's also important to recognize that these dips may continue with tech/growth/EV stocks, so probably factor that into your opinion and remember to also consider the long term prospect.

This took hours, hope you enjoyed.

My positions: None, I'm absolutely broke, I just like to write analyses and research.

**TL;DR**

**-** Good growth opportunity

\- Good market (Local environment too)

\- Good strategic approach

&lt;p&gt;We could also discuss their consumer relationship, and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out. &lt;a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210110170556if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kucf6r/chinese_autist_here_gonna_share_you_western/""&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt; Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla, but I don&amp;#39;t have the experience to confirm that. Regardless, between their own app for owners, special owner events, and communal spaces, it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BaaS. Battery as a Service. Or rather, a subscription. Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner, electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs. This shaves off roughly $10,000 off the price of their vehicles, which in turn boosts Nio&amp;#39;s price competitiveness and demand. Also, BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far, and these swapping stations even support the EV&amp;#39;s of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV&amp;#39;s makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. You may be thinking, does this benefit the consumer in anyway? Sure it does. The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs. Some people aren&amp;#39;t able to have their own home charging stations; many don&amp;#39;t even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily. Also, consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can&amp;#39;t afford to bleed money on certain battery solution, downgrade. Going on a large roadtrip? No problem, just rent a larger battery size. However, the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation. Instead of being stuck with a dated or low-end battery, all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery. What does this mean? Well, basically you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute. Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack, and one size fits all. This improves resale value, and provides a future proof battery system. Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later), but I&amp;#39;m personally a fan because it&amp;#39;s very pro-consumer, improves brand visibility (There&amp;#39;s hundreds of these things and other EV&amp;#39;s can use them attracting more traffic), and offers Nio Inc. another revenue stream. To recap: Extra revenue stream, easy to scale, brand visibility, and very pro-consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that&amp;#39;s worth mentioning is that the Chinese government favors BaaS companies when it comes to benefits, so there&amp;#39;s that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalysts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t actually have a lot of research in this area, so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I&amp;#39;ll add it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- European Market Expansion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Rapid Clean Tech Movement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road. This is pure speculation, but here&amp;#39;s an article written by &lt;a href=""https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-chinese-ev-maker-nio-might-be-coming-to-america-51612892800""&gt;Barron&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; claiming that Nio Inc. has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U.S. Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a quick peek at Nio&amp;#39;s infrastructure. As previously mentioned, they&amp;#39;ve chosen to offer battery as a subscription service, or BaaS for short. Now, we&amp;#39;ve already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice, but how well are they executing? As of right now, NIO currently has roughly 143 battery changing stations in China, and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more. Additionally, they&amp;#39;ve partnered with the Chinese state&amp;#39;s grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds great, right? We&amp;#39;ve discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they&amp;#39;ve established. There is of course, a predictable drawback that I should mention. Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way, other markets that lack China&amp;#39;s battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into, because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio-power network that allows for battery swapping. Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets, because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas. Anyway, let&amp;#39;s move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as you probably know, NIO is a China based EV company. Why is that a good thing exactly? Well, here&amp;#39;s why. The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.  On top of that, China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world, and even further, they&amp;#39;re the largest investor in renewable energies. OK, IDGAF where&amp;#39;s the relation to cars? It&amp;#39;s not super concrete, but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China&amp;#39;s firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy. They&amp;#39;ve been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy, so you know they&amp;#39;ll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible. Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals, and how large the Chinese EV market is/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow. Actually, let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- China is the &lt;em&gt;largest&lt;/em&gt; EV market in the world, representing roughly &lt;em&gt;50%&lt;/em&gt; of worldwide sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- From 2019 to 2020, Chinese EV sales increased &lt;em&gt;550%,&lt;/em&gt; from 200,00 units to 1,300,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- China expects sales to grow nearly &lt;em&gt;40%&lt;/em&gt; this year despite the pandemic, growing from 1,300,000 units to over 1,800,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between these statistics and China&amp;#39;s firm stance on clean tech and the EV market, we can conclude that NIO&amp;#39;s local environment is well suited for growth and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Financials and Numbers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not gonna do much talking here, just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q4 Positive Highlights and Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q4 Revenues grew 46.7% Quarter over Quarter, reaching $1.02 Billion, while many expected $1.04 Billion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliveries reached 17,000 Units for Q4. For reference they sold 40,000 units in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NIO projects 20,000+ Units for Q1 of 2021, which is 15% quarter over quarter. Again, for reference they sold 40,000 units for 2020. What&amp;#39;s more is that in Q1 2020, they only sold 4k cars but in Q1 2021 they&amp;#39;re projected to do &lt;strong&gt;400%&lt;/strong&gt; that number a year later. This type of growth is probably the most appealing aspect to potential investors the way I see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross and Vehicle Margin grew to 17.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NIO generated positive cash-flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the tech restraints from battery/chip shortages, management says production levels will be able to remain &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even with the production constraints through Q2, NIO&amp;#39;s outright delivery and revenue growth are visible - the company is on track to deliver nearly the same amount of cars in Q1/Q2 as it had in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NIO trades at about 13.1x projected FY21 revenues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q4 Negative Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the Semiconductor/Chip Shortage, NIO is expecting a bit of a bump in the road in terms of deliveries in the early half of the year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the combination of chip and battery constraints, NIO expects monthly production through Q2 to cap around ~7,500 units,  a 25% decrease from Q1 projections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Loss for Q4 clocked in at $1.3 Billion USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Losses weren&amp;#39;t reduced a whole lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missed EPS estimates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No dividend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Investment Outlook&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyst Consensus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a third opinion? This is one of the &lt;strong&gt;biggest green flags&lt;/strong&gt; IMO. These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is. Here&amp;#39;s a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks. Please keep in mind NIO&amp;#39;s recent price activity: 31-38 (As of Mar. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price targets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- HSBC: $49&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Morgan Stanley: $80&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- J.P. Morgan: $75&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Deutsche: $70&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Bank of America: $70&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Goldman Sachs: $64&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Daiwa: $100&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic, especially the Asia Pacific market, but I&amp;#39;m also a big fan of their strategic approach. Feel free to debate me on that. I&amp;#39;ve also heard a lot of praise regarding their management, seen a lot of fans of &lt;a href=""https://www.forbes.com/profile/william-li/?sh=894e17911a13""&gt;William Li&lt;/a&gt;, calling him a genius and the &amp;#39;Elon Musk of China&amp;#39;. There&amp;#39;s a couple things I&amp;#39;ve missed in this DD; I probably should&amp;#39;ve touched on the competition, their other services/packages, and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles, but I&amp;#39;m really no expert in those fields so I&amp;#39;ll leave that to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this thesis, I think it&amp;#39;s important to keep in mind how much the price has dipped recently. I mean within the past month it&amp;#39;s been as high as 61, and as low as 31. EV&amp;#39;s have taken a beating in these red days, and may even continue to decrease. I personally find any prices under 35 extremely appealing, but that general sub 40 area is pretty solid IMO. Hell, it almost went sub 30 on the 5th. I primarily like the growth opportunity Nio presents, especially when considering the discount its been at. It&amp;#39;s also important to recognize that these dips may continue with tech/growth/EV stocks, so probably factor that into your opinion and remember to also consider the long term prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took hours, hope you enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My positions: None, I&amp;#39;m absolutely broke, I just like to write analyses and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; Good growth opportunity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Good market (Local environment too)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Good strategic approach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The bigwig banks have price targets way higher above where it currently sits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Huge dip (50% at one point)&lt;/p&gt;

I was forbidden from talking to technical support because they already knew about it. I still don't have my money back. They never publicly acknowledged the problem. I'm now going through FINRA arbitration. (Reference myself)

DISCLOSURE: I have about $50k worth of puts on $SCHW, which I purchased after having discovered enough of this. To be clear, though, I bought the puts as a result of this information. Not the other way around.

This is not financial advice. But I do not think you should trust this company.

Also, side note: Schwab owns TD Ameritrade. They acquired them last year.",t2_32e59,False,,0,False,Schwab is a *dangerous* company and may be insolvent. Here's a big list of serious red flags.

&lt;p&gt;Take this all with a grain of salt, and use your own judgment regarding the veracity of these claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwab, after acquiring TD Ameritrade, has over $7 trillion in assets under management, and about $50B in equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only takes an error of 0.7% of their assets to cause them to go insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over a month ago, a bug made me go naked short GME in my 401(k) cash account (this is illegal). This caused me to lose $180k in my retirement account when I covered it. Schwab had no explanation. I was forbidden from talking to technical support because they already knew about it. I still don&amp;#39;t have my money back. They never publicly acknowledged the problem. I&amp;#39;m now going through FINRA arbitration. (Reference myself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The above bug, if you know how to reproduce it, is an infinite money glitch for criminals. According to other user comments, this infinite money glitch has existed for over 7 months. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2s81j/i_own_negative_shares_in_a_stock/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2s81j/i_own_negative_shares_in_a_stock/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big thing that really tipped me off was how many other people are aware of the bug. When I posted about it, I got 60+ &amp;quot;this happened to me too&amp;quot; type comments. Seriously, look for yourself. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Phantom shares&amp;quot;. This is either a grave error, or a hack, or accounting fraud, at any rate another separate and potentially massive disaster.

,stocks,"Hey y'all,

As the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.

I'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT-mature growth

Looking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up these past couple of years into what they are today,. What, in your eyes are those stocks and why? Sure they could still be SQ ROKU and SHOP and I will continue to add these on red days.

My research has led me to consider the following:

**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform

**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.

**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.

Next up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI

**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been

**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys

**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.

**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show

**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back

Notable mentions: CRWD, NET, ZM, LMND

,stocks,"Hey Traders, 

Today I'm writing about one of my favorite secondary indicators, Volume Profile Visible Range (""VPVR"").  What I mean by a ""secondary indicator"" is that I generally do not trade solely based off of the VPVR. When I decide to put on a trade, frequently off some of the prior indicators and techniques I have introduced (moving averages, RSI, Stochs, historical horizontal support/resistance), I will then look at the VPVR to see if there is any further confluence with the indicator. If the VPVR lines up nicely with some of the other things I'm seeing I will then adjust my risk appetite or confidence for the trade. That being said I have met some good traders who use the VPVR as one of their primary indicators along with historical support/resistance levels. VPVR can be quite effective on it's own for certain trading styles.  

**Background Info**

VPVR comes from a family of visible volume profile indicators that essentially display the volume done at various price levels on an asset along the right side of the chart, thereby enabling a technical trader to quickly identify the highest volume nodes at specific price levels. This allows a trader to identify price levels that have heightened significance because of the substantial volume done at these levels. 

I prefer VPVR over the Fixed Range and Session Volume visible ranges because it allows me to move my charts around more freely without having to adjust the inputs on the indicator. VPVR will basically spit out the visible volume node data for whatever price action you currently have on your screen. 

See this 1 Day chart of S&amp;P 500 Futures to get a quick introduction to VPVR: [https://imgur.com/gallery/M8DUSmo](https://imgur.com/gallery/M8DUSmo)

**Why do High Volume Nodes (""HVN"") matter?**

These high volume nodes (""HVN"") carry significance in markets because they are areas where a lot of price action and price discovery has occurred. If price holds above a HVN it can be generally interpreted as market consensus that the asset should hold its currently levels and possibly move higher. The opposite applies when price breaks through a HVN. This concept ties into and is closely related to why historical support/resistance levels are significant. Distilled to its simplest terms,  HVN's are levels where sophisticated market participants and algorithms have put on positions and they will generally defend their positions with more buying/selling, however when these levels are broken they will be very quick to flip to the opposing buy/sell side in accordance with their risk management guidelines.  As a result,  a lot of explosive price action can happen around these HVN's, either as a bounce, rejection, or break through. 

**The Point of Control!**

This concept is further amplified when you come to the Point of Control (""PoC""), because it is THE HIIGHEST VOLUME NODE. The market participation, active positions from that level, and significance to overall trend when looking at higher time frame charts (1d, 3d, 1w) is further heightened for the PoC. The PoC is a great spot to look for potential bounces on price action and also for quick and sudden reversals in trend when broken. 

**VPVR as a Secondary Indicator**

Here is a little demo of how I frequently use the VPVR as one of my main secondary indicators: [https://imgur.com/gallery/ejXBDZd](https://imgur.com/gallery/ejXBDZd)

A trader could then add to their long positions at relevant levels on the way up. 

Conversely, if oscillators and price action are looking pretty bearish and a trader thinks the previously identified liquidity zone might break this time, VPVR could be used as follows: [https://imgur.com/gallery/cz3jWdl](https://imgur.com/gallery/cz3jWdl)

In the example above you will notice that I am using the VPVR in confluence with exponential moving averages (""ema's"") AND historical horizontal support/resistance levels. I find that the VPVR truly becomes powerful and effective for my personal trading style when used in conjunction with these other indicators. 

Another great tool to use in confluence with the VPVR are Fibonacci retracement/extension levels. When a HVN or the PoC lines up with a critical fibonacci level it is another ""confidence booster' for me when trading.  Fibonacci retracements will be one of the next installments in the TA series so stay tuned if you want to learn more about fibs!

**The Danger of Low Value Nodes (""LVN"")**

As previously explained herein, HVN's have significance in the market because that is where a lot of prior price action has taken place so there will be many market participants interested in those areas. Conversely, LVN's act as a vacuum or air pocket where price will absolutely rip through because there is not a lot of price history or market participation at those levels. So, when I see HVN's getting increasingly sparse underneath an asset as it continues to go up I take that as a ""watch tf out"" warning sign, because when the asset reverses it has the potential to do so in a very nasty way.

See this 1D chart of MDB to see the significance of LVN's: [https://imgur.com/gallery/kcbm21M](https://imgur.com/gallery/kcbm21M)

So that wraps up my introduction to VPVR! I hope it was useful to all the technical traders out there looking to expand their toolkit.

After watching the madness happen in Texas, the power outages, bursting pipes and more (hope everyone in TX is doing better! &lt;3 ). It got me thinking about America’s overall infrastructure problems and the failed promises from different Presidential administrations over the years.

Here’s what I’m thinkin:

Rolling blackouts in Texas makes the rest of the country take a second-look at their power grids and deeper into overall infrastructure. There is a new political push to update America’s outdated infrastructure after decades of neglect (https://infrastructurereportcard.org/). This also has potential to create new jobs and help recover from COVID’s impact. It’s really such a win-win idea to help our country in an area we desperately need an overhaul. IMO the only thing holding work like this back is ‘politics’.

Biden and Democrats would love to pass legislation like this while they have a majority. Even Trump wanted to get infrastructure work done, so there would/could/should be support from some Republicans as well. Pete Buttigieg is a young-gun in the Democratic party, has shown willingness to tackle big challenges - he would love to get his name attached to a large and historical infrastructure bill. IMO, one thing holding it back is the GOP not wanting to let the Democrats get a ‘win’ by passing (more) historic legislation. 

https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/state-us-infrastructure

‘from roads and bridges to freight rail and ports to electrical grids and internet provision. But the systems currently in place were built decades ago, and economists say that delays and rising maintenance costs are holding economic performance back.’

This is purely speculation. I am an idiot. I really hope we get some work like this done during the Biden administration and want to support American companies at the same time.

,stocks,"Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. 

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. 

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. 

Highlights

The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.

Shares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.

,stocks,"$UCL uCloudLink is an innovative mobile technology company established to offer the world's leading mobile data traffic sharing marketplace based on Cloud SIM technology. We provide the best global mobile data services to billions of users in over 140 countries and regions.

What do they do?

Essentially, you sign up as a customer to use their SIM and wifi services on your mobile device, like a phone plan. However, you are not tied down to a provider. You have access to ALL the providers that are partnered with them. This means, you will get the best service no matter where you are. If you have better service with AT&amp;T in New York City and better Verizon in Tokyo, you will use those respectively. This is huge. You will not have to be tied down with a provider. You can utilize all the providers. 

UCL was named the most innovative 5G company recently and I expect this will continue. Decentralized cellular and wifi services are in huge demand. The ability to use whichever is best based on location an attractive offering. 

They offer a PaaS and Sass product which optimizes supply and demand of SIM resources based on usage and location to provide enhanced performance for their customers as a whole. 

Why am I buying this stock?

This company is killing it financially. Revenue growth has been growing from 126M to 158M 2018-2019 and has increased since then. The profit margin is crazy with 65M on 160M revenue, which leaves 15M a year to R&amp;D. The best growth companies always operate at a loss to pump money back into the company. Even still, they turned 5.21M in Net Income.

UCL is a fairly new company that recently flopped it's IPO, which looks like an excellent buying opportunity. They are continuing to grow in Asia and have recently expanded their footprint in the North America with new partners in the US and Canada. 

They have a huge opportunity to grow, with not a lot of room to go down based on financials and growth alone.

Anyways, I truly believe that at least for tomorrow we're going to have a true bounce based on what people think are good deals and not just a dead cat one. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first reason, one pattern I was noticing among a lot of stocks like TSLA, AMD, APPL, and a bunch more were that there were a lot of the little spikes in the ah chart. I think that means it's when institutional investors buy big portions and usually when this would happen I wouldn't bat a second eye but today it seemed like it was happening with so many stocks and not just once but multiple times across nearly all of tech.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, although futures aren't an accurate prediction of what's going to happen tomorrow, they're all up big, and for the first time in a few weeks were back to normal where the Nasdaq is leading and although I know it's because it fell much more it's still a promising sight to see as other times futures were up the dow and SMP still led. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, although I could be completely wrong about this and it's juts a hunch, the Nasdaq is down around 10% on the dot, the correction I have been comparing this the most to is mainly the one in October, where much like this one tech was heavily beat down although for slightly different reasons. Anyway, in October when the Nasdaq was down around 10.6% that is when a true recovery had begun to happen, and although this could be something completely different, I believe that is another promising sign.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, it's that nothing can repeat forever. The thing I'm trying to say here is that every single morning we wake up, see the Nasdaq up, met by rapid selling. But can this really continue? I understand it technically could but then wouldn't everyone just short it in the morning for easy money, and because I personally believe there is no such thing as ""easy money"" there had to be a point where the Nasdaq holds strong and the suits simply decide to just buy back into tech. 

Additionally, are we not gonna talk about how fucking extended these recovery plays are. Just a heads up I own BA and JPM which in my mind no way BA is overvalued while JPM could be but I believe with how this recovery is going and with Powell promising interest rates to stay low they're probably safe but what the fuck is going on with UAL, DAL, and all the other airlines. Some of these airlines are close to break even when we all know the travel industry especially along business is going to change forever and their revenues are still down big with the prospects that in 2-3 years they would be back to where they started. Also, don't even get me started on hotels and oil. Anyway, what I'm saying is that at what point to people start taking a profit of the recovery plays and actually start rotating back again to tech.

**Apple Inc** [AAPL 3.52%](https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ) [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apple-tv-plus-announces-programming-partnership-with-nobel-laureate-malala-yousafzai/) a multi-year partnership with the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Malala Yousafzai.

**What Happened:** Apple announced on Monday its plan to add the 23-year-old women’s rights activist’s production company, Extracurricular, to its streaming service.

Yousafzai’s content will include original dramas, comedies, documentaries, animation and children’s series.

Yousafzai, who has published three books for both adults and children, is also the creator of an online digital publication, Assembly, which has published stories from girls and young women in more than 100 countries, according to Apple’s blog.

Yousafzai will use her Apple TV+ platform to “bring families together, forge friendships, build movements and inspire children to dream,” said Yousafzai. “And I couldn’t ask for a better partner than Apple to help bring these stories to life. I’m grateful for the opportunity to support women, young people, writers and artists in reflecting the world as they see it.”

**Why It Matters:** Yousafzai will join a lineup of other well-known figures on Apple TV+ such as Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Idris Elba as the streaming service seeks to add educational content to its roster and expand outside the entertainment genre in a further effort to compete with **Netflix Inc** [NFLX 3.08%](https://benzinga.com/stock/nflx#NASDAQ), **Roku Inc** [ROKU 8.01%](https://benzinga.com/stock/roku#NASDAQ) and **Walt Disney Co.** [DIS 2.26%](https://benzinga.com/stock/dis#NYSE).

**What’s More:** On Oct. 9, 2012, [Yousafzai](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai#:~:text=Malala%20Yousafzai%20(born%20July%2012,%201997)%20is%20a,person%20to%20have%20won%20the%20Nobel%20Peace%20Prize.) was shot in the head by a masked Taliban gunman in retaliation for her activism. After recovering in Birmingham, England, Yousafzai began advocating for the right to education and has since toured the world speaking to audiences at the United Nations, Harvard University and the Oxford Union.

Yousafzai graduated from Oxford University last year and has received dozens of national and international awards, as well as honors for her work to support women and children.

Yousafzai also started the [Malala Fund](https://www.malala.org/) to support girls getting a safe, free and quality 12-year education. 

Although Apple and Yousafzai have partnered together before on a number of products to support women and children, “The partnership has since expanded, and in Brazil, Apple’s 10 Developer Academies have partnered with Malala Fund to advance girls’ education opportunities there and around the world,” Apple said in the release.",t2_69s9jv22,False,,0,False,Apple TV+ Partners With Women's Rights Activist Malala Yousafzai $AAPL,[],r/stocks,False,6,tickernews,0,,False,t3_m1aiqr,False,dark,0.55,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Company News,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615337218.0,text,6,,,text,self.stocks,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.benzinga.com/users/melanie-schaffer""&gt;Melanie Schaffer&lt;/a&gt; , Benzinga Staff Writer &lt;/p&gt;

(from Trend Trading for Dummies by Barry Burns)

Imagine a futuristic TV game show where you're sitting at home in front of your TV, watching a bus driving down the city streets The bus is packed with people yelling at the driver trying to tell him which way to go next Your job is to predict where the bus is going and type your predictions into a computer one block before the bus gets there.

Is it an impossible task? Almost! But some things could make it easier. Some events could put the odds on your side — even if just for a moment.

For example, if the driver stopped at a traffic light in the right lane and had his right-turn signal blinking, that would be a reasonable indicator that the bus is about to turn right You could type into your computer that the bus will turn right here and go on at least to the next cross street.

Of course, the bus driver could go straight anyway (ever been behind a driver who's had his turn signal on for blocks without turning?), but the odds are that when people activate their turn signal, they turn in the direction of that signal.

If the driver is crossing an intersection and you can see up ahead that the traffic light at the next intersection is yellow and about to turn red, you could type into your computer that the bus will stop at the next light. Will you be correct? The driver could speed right through the red light without stopping, and that does happen occasionally, but the odds are that the bus will stop at the next light. Even a police car with sirens blaring will slow down at red lights.

If the bus is speeding north (the direction or trend of the car) on the street at 65 miles per hour (the speed or momentum of the car), the odds are against it being able to stop on a dime at the next intersection. It's pretty safe to say that it would be an exception to the rule and not the driver's intention to stop that soon.

This example illustrates how strong momentum puts the odds on your side that the trend will continue. In trading, if you get into a trend that has strong momentum behind it, you have a high-probability trade that the trend will continue after you enter your position instead of coming to an end immediately after you place your trade.",t2_4upnz,False,,0,False,Cool Explanation of How Momentum Investing Works,[],r/stocks,False,6,,0,,False,t3_m0x6p9,False,dark,0.74,,public,7,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 2},,True,,1615287663.0,text,6,,,text,self.stocks,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this explanation of how momentum investing works is helpful to some here!&lt;/p&gt;

Followup from this post. I was invested since 2019 but this time I just couldn't shake the feeling of it going down fast. Ever since the [China fiasco](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/tech/tesla-china-regulators-intl-hnk/index.html) and the way Elon purchased bitcoin just came across as such a desperate publicity stunt. All this started to make me feel really uneasy. From there I sold just in time and managed to avoid the 32% loss from that month. That being said, I know the market altogether dropped and open to the possibility that I may have just gotten lucky.

&lt;p&gt;Followup from this post. I was invested since 2019 but this time I just couldn&amp;#39;t shake the feeling of it going down fast. Ever since the &lt;a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/tech/tesla-china-regulators-intl-hnk/index.html""&gt;China fiasco&lt;/a&gt; and the way Elon purchased bitcoin just came across as such a desperate publicity stunt. All this started to make me feel really uneasy. From there I sold just in time and managed to avoid the 32% loss from that month. That being said, I know the market altogether dropped and open to the possibility that I may have just gotten lucky.

,stocks,"**My Take on FTHM:** **Fathom Realty**

I am posting about this ticker because I love this company. First, I am not a financial advisor, just a Real Estate Agent who is very proud of their organization. As a Fathom Agent, I have received stock from the company and I have also purchased stock on my own outside of those grants because I believe in the product so much.

On to the information:

First, this is a 5.13mm float stock that moves quickly, so beware. It was an IPO that launched on 7/30/2020.

Also, this stock has EARNINGS on 3/10/2021. 

As far as when they will be profitable, a 2/10/21 article by Simply Wall St projected that FTHM will be profitable by 2023 at their current rate of growth. Again, not an expert so that is why I am posting that.

**Why agents are moving to Fathom over major brokerages:** 

1: They pay significantly less commission with Fathom than the other Major Brokers

2: The Fathom proprietary technology, IntelliAgent, saves agents time and money and makes it easier to get paid faster.

3: Free CRM Program for Agents

4: Stock Incentive

**In Depth Detail:**

1: Simple enough, Fathom has one of the best opportunities for agents in the market when it comes to KEEPING their own commission. At a brokerage like Keller Williams, you are expected to pay 20% to 30% of your commission on each sale to the brokerage. On a $300,000 sale at 3% commission, that comes out to $1,800 (@ 20%) or $2,700 (@ 30%) of your $9,000 commission. These brokerages also have desk/monthly/errors and omission (e&amp;o) fees that are $25+ a month. At a certain amount of total commission paid, some brokerages “cap” the agent and they then get to keep 100% of commission. I have seen this be anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 (this will vary by market).

With Fathom, an agent only pays a one-time yearly fee of $500 (it comes out of the first commission check), and then $450 per transaction up to 12 sales. Then they pay $99 a transaction afterwards. A Fathom agent pays a total of $5,900 before they cap, then $99 afterwards for every transaction.  This is simply a PHENOMINAL deal for the agent.

I reviewed a number of other agencies like Fathom where you keep 100% of your commission and pay a transaction fee. I did not find one that beat Fathom. The closest second was Realty One. I really liked their offering as well but their costs with monthly fees and transaction fees were double what Fathom was.

The only way I could figure out how to keep more of my commission was to open my own brokerage, which has significantly more liability.

2: Fathom OWNS a program called IntelliAgent which every agent they have today uses to submit their paperwork and to obtain funding on their transactions. An agent uploads certain documents to the program in order for their district manager to review for compliance. While this sounds simple, it has been a nightmare in the industry finding something that works across different states with different requirements per transaction. Fathom has navigated this hurdle and IntelliAgent makes it easy for the Agent to get paid. I can speak personally that before I worked for Fathom I had to hire a Transaction Coordinator for each sale I made ($300+ per transaction) just to move the paperwork through my old brokerage. With Fathom I have never needed any assistance because IntelliAgent works so well. This will be a KEY factor in how they scale up from the 27 states they are in today.

3: Right now Fathom gives all their agents KV Core, which is a CRM /Marketing platform for agents to use to help run their business and customer drips. It is the same program a number of real estate companies use (I believe EXP uses KV Core). It is a VERY good program. But they do not OWN the program and I am sure they pay a hefty sum to offer this as part of their package.

On 3/2/2021 Fathom closed a deal to purchase a company called Naberly Solutions. With Naberly, Fathom will have the last piece of the puzzle they did not own; their own proprietary CRM software. By owning the software, Fathom will reduce their costs as they no longer will be paying for KV Core for agents and differentiate themselves from other brokerages. Owning their CRM should also be a major plus for investors. This will be a savings for Fathom once it is rolled out to their agents. I have not seen a timeline announced for that at this time.

4: One final reason agents are moving to Fathom is because of the stock program. Right now, seasoned agents are being given stock grants for joining Fathom. Agents who qualify are being offered $200 per transaction they had the year prior to joining Fathom, up to $6000 in grants. These grants come with a three-year vesting schedule which will help keep agents with the company. A lot of the original agents received their stock grants at $10.00 per share when the company had their IPO last year. The stock is currently selling over $30.00 and was over $50.00 before the market downturn the past few weeks. Fathom also launched a program to incentivize current agents to recruit new agents. Agents also get stock grants for each transaction they complete.

A lot of brokerages have an additional hook to get agents to recruit, but if you look more into them it is more of a pyramid scheme than an incentive program. No one has a program like Fathom is offering with their stock grants. I also believe the upside on the stock is significant and many agents moving over see the potential as well.

So if everything is cheap and the agent is getting such a great deal, how does Fathom make money? They do so by scaling the business. For the past six years they have been on the INC 500/5000 Fastest Growing Companies in America and are currently in 27 states. Because of the influx of new agents in 2020, they had 74% revenue growth between Q3 2019 vs Q3 2020.  

Fathom also bought a title company in 2020 which should create additional opportunity on each transaction completed by their agents to make additional revenue by being the company who manages the title search (around $75 to $200 per transaction). This does not mean they WILL get that additional revenue on each transaction, but the opportunity will be there when it wasn’t before. 

I do not expect the acquisitions to end there. They just acquired 230 additional agents in Atlanta through the acquisition of Red Barn Real Estate on 3/5/2021 to add on to the 200 agents Fathom already had in the area per their press release.

Overall I moved my business to Fathom for the reasons I listed above. I believe in the company and I like the stock.",t2_9sd9nixt,False,,0,False,FTHM Fathom Realty DD,[],r/stocks,False,6,,0,,False,t3_m0trku,False,dark,0.88,,public,11,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Company Analysis,False,11,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615276687.0,text,6,,,text,self.stocks,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Take on FTHM:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Fathom Realty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"Hey everyone,

I'm just getting comfortable with selling covered calls, particularly on $F, &amp; was wondering if this actually, despite being an options trade, could reduce volatility for one's account value (at least in some cases). 

In particular, I sold 7x 4/9 14c. Ford's been more volatile in the last few months than historically, I believe, but this trade &amp; the strategy in general don't strike me as particularly risky. Ford being Ford, I can't imagine it breaking $15.50 (a 22% gain from today's close in 4 weeks) without some huge news. So while I'm limited on upside, it's likely minimal, and this acts as a hedge on declines as well. If I have to sell out of my position, I expect it'll be near the expiry date &amp; so I'll be able to re-enter, having made a solid gain.

Please let me know if there's anything I'm missing with the above logic.

Also, are companies that trade like Ford not excellent candidates for selling calls? Good appreciation prospects from here as an EV/recovery play, but don't move 50% on a monthly basis? Especially when the dividend is reinstated, being able to see slow gains + quarterly payouts &amp; collecting premium seems like a win-win for the time being.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-8-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Nasdaq set for sharp drop after Friday’s comeback

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Monday, with a sharp drop in the Nasdaq and tech names indicated to start the new week after Friday’s big turnaround. Tesla shed another 2% in the premarket after closing Friday below $600 per share for the first time since early December. The stock has lost a third of its value since its all-time intraday high in late January.

&gt; * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday all broke three-session losing streaks, with strong advances. For the week, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 gained 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. However, the Nasdaq dropped 2% last week. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were up nearly 3% and 2.3%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. The Nasdaq was just above breakeven ahead of Monday’s open.

*****

&gt; # 2. Treasury yields rise after Senate Covid relief bill passage

&gt; * Senate passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill Saturday wasn’t enough to put stocks in the green Monday as more economic stimulus on top of an already recovering economy continued to stoke inflation concerns. That’s pushing bond yields higher Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield trading around 1.6%, shy of Friday’s one-year high. The 10-year yield has risen rapidly since the end of January, adding more than 0.5% in a little over a month.

*****

&gt; # 3. Biden says direct payments of up to $1,400 going out soon

&gt; * The Democratic-held House aims to pass the Senate-approved Covid stimulus package on Tuesday and then send it President Joe Biden for his signature. The bill approved in the Senate on Saturday comes with a smaller, compromise federal unemployment benefits boost and without a federal minimum wage increase. The legislation includes direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans, which Biden said Saturday could start going out within two weeks.

*****

&gt; # 4. Stocks to watch: Disney, Comcast, GameStop, GE

&gt; * Shares of Disney rose more than 1% in Monday’s premarket trading after California officials on Friday cleared theme parks to open at reduced capacity on April 1. They closed nearly a year ago due to the pandemic. The order includes Disneyland in the southern part of the state, Comcast’s Universal Studios Hollywood and others. Disney World in Florida and Universal Studios Orlando opened with capacity limits over the summer. Shares of Comcast, parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC, fell in the premarket.

&gt; * Shares of GameStop surged about 12% in Monday’s premarket after Bloomberg reported that the company tapped board member Ryan Cohen to guide the video game retailer’s transition to an e-commerce business. Cohen, a major GameStop investor and founder of online pet retailer Chewy, will lead a board task force on digital changes.

&gt; * General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland’s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world’s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday’s premarket.

*****

&gt; # 5. Oil prices rise after Saudi Arabia facilities attacked

&gt; * Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose above $70 per barrel Monday for the first time in more than a year. The surge came after Saudi Arabia said Sunday that its Saudi Aramco facilities were targeted by missiles and drones. Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement claimed responsibility for the attack. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, also moved higher, trading above $66 at nearly a two-year high.

Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp;amp; news on this Monday, March 8th, 2021-&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-8-2021.html""&gt;5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;1. Nasdaq set for sharp drop after Friday’s comeback&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Monday, with a sharp drop in the Nasdaq and tech names indicated to start the new week after Friday’s big turnaround. Tesla shed another 2% in the premarket after closing Friday below $600 per share for the first time since early December. The stock has lost a third of its value since its all-time intraday high in late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday all broke three-session losing streaks, with strong advances. For the week, the Dow and S&amp;amp;P 500 gained 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. However, the Nasdaq dropped 2% last week. The Dow and S&amp;amp;P 500 were up nearly 3% and 2.3%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. The Nasdaq was just above breakeven ahead of Monday’s open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. Treasury yields rise after Senate Covid relief bill passage&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senate passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill Saturday wasn’t enough to put stocks in the green Monday as more economic stimulus on top of an already recovering economy continued to stoke inflation concerns. That’s pushing bond yields higher Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield trading around 1.6%, shy of Friday’s one-year high. The 10-year yield has risen rapidly since the end of January, adding more than 0.5% in a little over a month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. Biden says direct payments of up to $1,400 going out soon&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Democratic-held House aims to pass the Senate-approved Covid stimulus package on Tuesday and then send it President Joe Biden for his signature. The bill approved in the Senate on Saturday comes with a smaller, compromise federal unemployment benefits boost and without a federal minimum wage increase. The legislation includes direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans, which Biden said Saturday could start going out within two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. Stocks to watch: Disney, Comcast, GameStop, GE&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney rose more than 1% in Monday’s premarket trading after California officials on Friday cleared theme parks to open at reduced capacity on April 1. They closed nearly a year ago due to the pandemic. The order includes Disneyland in the southern part of the state, Comcast’s Universal Studios Hollywood and others. Disney World in Florida and Universal Studios Orlando opened with capacity limits over the summer. Shares of Comcast, parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC, fell in the premarket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of GameStop surged about 12% in Monday’s premarket after Bloomberg reported that the company tapped board member Ryan Cohen to guide the video game retailer’s transition to an e-commerce business. Cohen, a major GameStop investor and founder of online pet retailer Chewy, will lead a board task force on digital changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland’s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world’s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday’s premarket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. Oil prices rise after Saudi Arabia facilities attacked&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose above $70 per barrel Monday for the first time in more than a year. The surge came after Saudi Arabia said Sunday that its Saudi Aramco facilities were targeted by missiles and drones. Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement claimed responsibility for the attack. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, also moved higher, trading above $66 at nearly a two-year high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So let's get started. You probably already google the company and might think to yourself, why should I invest in a company that exists for 100 years man, I want rockets!!! Well here is the thing; I for myself am really under stress with all this GME, AMC, BB, PLTR and other stuff. I wanted to look for a couple ""safer"" investments to at least park a couple percent of my money knowing it will manage itself over time. The company might not be a rocket, but an electric train which like the European trains go above 300kmph and unlike a rocket won't crash back on earth again as they are on rails.

**Now the DD, I will analyse the stock in the following points:**  
**1. Product and history**  
**2. Future of the company**  
**3. numbers, number, numbers**  
**3.1 market cap, outstanding shares, employees, ownership, stock movements**  
**3.2 earnings, dividends, margins and growth**  
**4. personal opinion**  
**5. sources and listings**  
**6. TLDR**

# 1. Product and history

Kemria Oyj is a finish organisation that was founded in 1920 to focus on delivering fertilizers and mining chemicals like sulfuric acids. To make it short from here, they got a lot of capital and over the next couple decades they just bought themselves in to a lot of chemistry fields through aquisitions and merger of and with other companies. Only since 1971, the company is named Kemira.  
Basically they never stopped doing this until after the 2000s in which they decided to not just buy up every chemical company there is, but rather specialize on a couple products. They were already running on basically every continent selling to over 100 countries.  
The products they specialized on was the paper industry, water industry and its recycling as well as the energy efficiency optimization. The company is all about using ressources right in a world where ressources are getting shorter in supply which brings me to point 2:

# 2. Future of the company

The company is building it's business around a couple megatrends like recycling, clean water as well as reliable energy saving. More and more business are trying to get access to affordable energy and are forced by the public to set on clean water and recycling resulting in a bigger and brighter future for this massive company. But a company betting on future trends while being 100 years old? Exactly! The company is running profits for decades while still going into massive trends and how good these profits are is mentioned below in point 3:

# 3. Numbers, numbers, numbers

**3.1 Market cap, shares, ownership, movements**

Kemira is making moves in over 100 countries with it's over 5000 employees while currently sitting at

* **Market Cap:** **€2.100b with** **152.92m Shares outstanding**

These shares are currently owned by 2/3 institutions, companies and insiders while only **32.7%** are open for the general public.

These shares moved **18.0% up** in the last 365 days while over a period of 30 days they actually lost **1.7%.** This might be okay in comparison to the overall finish market moving **16.8%** in the last 365 days. But looking at the chemical industry in finland moving **23.2%** in last 365 days and **2.2%** in the last 30 days, they seem to underperform.

So let's look at the finances to understand why this might be.

**3.2 Earnings, dividends and growth**

Lets look at the price/earnings ratio:  
**-&gt; Kemira: 16.1x -&gt;Industry23.9x -&gt;Market27.7x**

While Kemira Oyj stock was even going down a bit while market moved up and significantly lacking in stock price performane compared to the market, it actually has a far better earnings ratio than the industry aswell as the market. This is also supported by the price/book ratio being at **1.8x** compared to **2.2x** in the finish market.

The **dividends** being payed by Kemira are representing a **4,21% return** coming up on March 25 with 68% of earnings being payed out. Interestingly enough, this is higher than the average of the top 25% dividend stocks in the industry paying **3.9%.**

In terms of growth the company is forecasting a growth rate of **5%**, which is funny as they predicted this the last years aswell, while growing earnings by **12.1%** per year on last 5 year average which last year growth rate being at **19%.** ( Interestingly enough, the industrys growth rate in last year was negative with a downfall of **-10.5%**, showing that Kemira is setting on future trends in the chemistry sector)

The company is not only building up more clients and getting into more technology but also leveled up their net profit margin from **4.1%** to **5.4%** YoY.

One downside factor for investors might be their debt level sitting at **66.2%** debt to equity. (last year was **66.6%**)  
This might possibly be a good thing though as their interest payments are well covered by EBIT with a **7.7x** coverage aswell as an operating cash flow of **47%.**

# 4. Personal opinion

Kemira Oyj is not only a company in a northern european country giving it a basic security in terms of fraud and legislations, but it is also a company that has been build for a century. They are currently running a business in a solid industry and are outperforming the market in terms of growth rate and price/earnings ratio while still having the least stock movement. Their financials are solid with a good EBIT while also having massive amount of cash flow and a dividend yield of over **4%.** The management not only knows how to perform through rough times, but also make their company better through them by even lowering their debt and increasing their profit margins.  
Besides the long and safe history of the company and its good financials, I think it will also have a huge chance coming up in the sectors they are building up. Water will soon be a scarce ressource just like precious metals and the same goes for energy. Kemira is positioning itself in a perfect way by being a giant in a race of rabbits looking to be the next big thing coming from 10 people to 10.000 while Kemira can just go from 5000 to 10000 quite easily.  
Even if you do not see the future upside potential, then the finances alone lead me to the conclusion of a company that is overlooked and heavily underrated. This is a sale that might not last for long, but it can really boost your portfolio in terms of balance, safety and dividens. While I am not a financial expert, I expect the stock to move from its current price of **13.79€ to 15€** by july and with it currently gaining traction and news coverage in some places I can see it hitting **16€ or 17€** by end of year if we keep seeing this bull market continuing. This might sound like a stupid play with a gain of **25%** max this year but compared to 0% interest I think its a nice deal and it presents some cooler notifications on my phone compared to GME movements and other bets.

IF they play their cards right aswell and keep outperforming the market, keep lowering their debt, keep building up their margins and continue with great financials, the price/earnings ratio will very soon be a lot higher. Add this to the future trend they are facing and they might be able to make big moves resulting in a 5x in this decade if you use your imagination for a minute.

# 6. TLDR

&lt;h1&gt;4. Personal opinion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kemira Oyj is not only a company in a northern european country giving it a basic security in terms of fraud and legislations, but it is also a company that has been build for a century. They are currently running a business in a solid industry and are outperforming the market in terms of growth rate and price/earnings ratio while still having the least stock movement. Their financials are solid with a good EBIT while also having massive amount of cash flow and a dividend yield of over &lt;strong&gt;4%.&lt;/strong&gt; The management not only knows how to perform through rough times, but also make their company better through them by even lowering their debt and increasing their profit margins.&lt;br/&gt;
Besides the long and safe history of the company and its good financials, I think it will also have a huge chance coming up in the sectors they are building up. Water will soon be a scarce ressource just like precious metals and the same goes for energy. Kemira is positioning itself in a perfect way by being a giant in a race of rabbits looking to be the next big thing coming from 10 people to 10.000 while Kemira can just go from 5000 to 10000 quite easily.&lt;br/&gt;
Even if you do not see the future upside potential, then the finances alone lead me to the conclusion of a company that is overlooked and heavily underrated. This is a sale that might not last for long, but it can really boost your portfolio in terms of balance, safety and dividens. While I am not a financial expert, I expect the stock to move from its current price of &lt;strong&gt;13.79€ to 15€&lt;/strong&gt; by july and with it currently gaining traction and news coverage in some places I can see it hitting &lt;strong&gt;16€ or 17€&lt;/strong&gt; by end of year if we keep seeing this bull market continuing. This might sound like a stupid play with a gain of &lt;strong&gt;25%&lt;/strong&gt; max this year but compared to 0% interest I think its a nice deal and it presents some cooler notifications on my phone compared to GME movements and other bets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF they play their cards right aswell and keep outperforming the market, keep lowering their debt, keep building up their margins and continue with great financials, the price/earnings ratio will very soon be a lot higher. Add this to the future trend they are facing and they might be able to make big moves resulting in a 5x in this decade if you use your imagination for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;5. sources and listings&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sources I mainly used for this DD were:&lt;br/&gt;
-&amp;gt; &lt;a href=""https://simplywall.st/stocks/fi/materials/hel-kemira/kemira-oyj-shares#summary""&gt;https://simplywall.st/stocks/fi/materials/hel-kemira/kemira-oyj-shares#summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

-&amp;gt; &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemira""&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemira&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The listings for the stock on different stock exchanges are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- KEMIRA at HLSE&lt;br/&gt;
- KEM at DB&lt;br/&gt;
- 0MGG at LSE&lt;br/&gt;
- KOYJ.F at OTCPK&lt;br/&gt;
- KEMIRH at BATS-CHIXE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;listings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;6. TLDR&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A finish chemistry company specializing in future trends like clean water, recycling and not wasting energy got a long good financial history and is outperforming the market in terms of earnings and margins while the stock is underperforming the market for no reason. It is owned mostly institutional and pays a dividend yield of over 4%.&lt;/p&gt;

I was studying the dividends of different companies, and how the stock price changes in correlation with anticipated dividends, and I made an observation.  


AJRD Aerojet Rocketdyne which was bought by Lockheed, is paying a 5$ per share dividend this year.  
Share price is 51 USD.  


As stated in Financial report Q4: [https://ir.aerojetrocketdyne.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aerojet-rocketdyne-holdings-inc-reports-2020-fourth-quarter-and](https://ir.aerojetrocketdyne.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aerojet-rocketdyne-holdings-inc-reports-2020-fourth-quarter-and)  


 On December 19, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a one-time cash dividend of $5.00 per share (including shares underlying the 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes (“2¼% Notes”) on an as-converted basis) (the “Pre-Closing Dividend”).   


The Pre-Closing Dividend is payable on March 24, 2021, to the holders of the Company’s shares and convertible senior notes as of the close of business on March 10, 2021. The $56.00 per share price under the Merger Agreement is expected to be reduced to $51.00 after the pre-closing payment of the Pre-Closing Dividend to the Company’s stockholders and holders of its 2¼% Notes on as-converted basis.   


  
As compared to other companies' dividend, this is pretty good.  


My question:  


\*Is the price likely to stay stable (50$+) Until the dividend is paid?  


\*Do I need to hold the stock after March 10 to receive dividend?  


\*Do stock prices usually go up or down in anticipation of dividend payouts?

I liquidated 20% of my QQQ/VTI still being profitable. The main reason is that I have no cash in case shit hits the fan.

I am looking for guidance on how to set and forget limit orders on VTI. What I ideally want is to change these limit orders every 3 to 6 months as VTI goes up.

I will set it this way:

&lt;li&gt;buy 100 shares at 180, 200 shares at 160 and so on. Right now VTI is at 200 ish.&lt;/li&gt;

I think Ericsson could be a nice bet for the medium-long term portfolio. 

Ericsson is, to say the least, leading the race in 5G - and they are... Swedish! This is increasingly important due to the other major 5G companies being Asian (Samsung and Huawei). 

It has been said that Huawei is leading in this 5G race, however, recent investigation uncovered that: 

“Ericsson leads the field with 16.1 percent of 5G patent families. Samsung has 11.0 percent, and then Huawei with 9.4 percent (the rest of the industry accounts for the other 63.5 percent).”

Apart from this, Ericsson had a new CEO take over in 2017 and has presented sound financials since. They have even suggested to increase their upcoming divided to 2 SEK.

With 5G being specifically designed for the M2M context (IoT), I see it playing a much more important role in society than 3G or even 4G has ever done.

I still hold some GME, which I don't want to have tied up in an ACAT transfer given everything that is going on.  I have mid-five-figures in Robinhood and I'll be adding almost the same amount in new cash.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand, my options are:

A) Partial ACAT - move everything except GME and leave that with Robinhood for now.  Sell it when I'm ready to sell, then move the cash later.

B) Deposit my matching funds in the new brokerage and buy everything in the new brokerage at the same time I sell everything in Robinhood, then move the cash from Robinhood.  This is nice because it is fast, and it saves on the transfer fee.

C) Are there options I haven't thought of?

&amp;#x200B;

Option A is annoying due to Robinhood's transfer fee, but that's not the end of the world, and I'm guessing is my best course of action?  I mostly don't want to leave anything with them at all, but I guess that wouldn't be the end of the world either.

What kind of issues does Option B create?  I'm assuming tax issues are my biggest challenge?  I just don't know how this would affect me.

DISCLAIMER: i’m new to this channel and neither a financial advisor nor an expert. 

the following is just intended to explain my intuition about what has been happening in markets over the past weeks and why many people are seeing red. 

—

# 1 : the value of companies

whoever values a company professionally, usually applies a discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation. it's not the only method to find the actual value, but by far the most common one used by analysts. the idea here is that a company has the value of the sum of all its future cash flows. this is a solid assumption, because in the end cash flows are what determines whether the company is successful in the long-term and how much money it can distribute to its investors. so the two basic questions are: how high will these cash flows be and what value do they have currently?

# 2 : the time value of money

now let's say a company will make 1bn in cash next year. that amount is not actually its current value. if i had the money now, i can invest it and gain interest in that one year. an important tool joins the party now: the risk-free rate. this is, usually, the interest rate on certain short-term government bills or bonds. they are risk-less, because in theory states cannot default. now, if i had the 1bn right now, i could make 1.5% return with it during the year, without any real risk. therefore, in one year from now, this 1bn only amounts to 985 million in todays money (you just divide by 1 + interest rate to the power of years). basically money loses value if you have to wait for it, because you have to miss out on the opportunities of doing something profitable with that money until then. 

# 3 : discounting

the process of deriving the current (usually lower) value of future cash flows is called discounting. you discount the future cash flows to their present value. this is where the DCF got its name. many applications use the risk-free rate as discounting rate, in stock valuations however, a common rate is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). the WACC is a weighted combination of a companies financing costs from the two main sources: debt and equity. debt financing are things like bonds and credit and their main cost is the interest they carry. equity financing is usually the emission of stocks and the cost of equity is whatever yield investors may demand, given the risk of the investment. the WACC incorporates both debt and equity costs based on the firms capital structure. 

# 4 : forecasting cash flows 

let's get back to our DCF from the first point. you would generally model the specific cash flows of a company for about 5 years and then add in something called ""terminal value"" for everything that comes after that. it is unrealistic that any forecast after 5 years is still accurate, so you just assume a company's last cash flow will grow with a certain rate (e.g. 2% like the global economy - at least long-term) and then calculate the total final value of said company, assuming it will exist forever. let's stick with the 1bn example: assuming this is the last year modeled and we assume 2% growth and a WACC of 1.5%. then, all future cash flows amount to 51 billion. this is called gordon-growth-model: just calculate the next cash flow after the last one with your growth rate and then divide it by the discount rate minus the growth rate: (1bn * 1.02) / (0.04 - 0.02). usually most of the companies value comes from this ""infinite horizon cash flow"" and the value is highly sensitive to both the discounting rate and the assumed growth rate. these future growth and interest rates are precisely what commentators mean when they say ""expectations are already priced in"" and it is one of the reasons why it is hard to beat the pros at their game. 

# 5 : inflation

of course, an interest rate of 1.5% is not getting you any real return if inflation is just as high: the money is being devalued per unit at the same speed as the units of money grow. this is why real interest rates must incorporate for inflation. the fisher equation shows this relationship: real interest rates are equal to the nominal interest rate minus inflation. if we stick with 1.5% interest and have an inflation of 0.5%, then the real interest rate is 1%. 

# 6 : what is happening right now?

central banks all over the world are pouring money into the markets and governments are using the chance of low interest rates to finance large fiscal stimuli in order to stabilise covid-hit economies. this new money supply creates inflation and the interest rates on bonds must compensate for it. higher expectations of inflation are therefore priced into the yields of such bonds. these higher interest rates however mean that all current valuations must be adapted for the new discount rate: we must now discount all future earnings with a higher rate and will end up with a lower present value of the firm. 

# 7 : where will it end ?

nobody knows - honestly. but valuations have gotten pretty excessive. i dont want to blame SPACs or robinhood, but they are definitely part of it. there are just too many companies with sky-high valuations that have not even made revenue or generated real income. these growth stocks have all of their value stuck in those projected future cash flows and they are not only getting discounted. investors are probably (and hopefully) also reevaluating whether growth expectations are somehow realistic or whether the valuation is not justified. lastly, debt financing costs of these companies (which often have no cash to pay for projects) also increase and lead to a higher WACC. if you are looking for a hedge against higher interest rates, financials are the place to be: their business model is to lend money at a rate higher than they borrow it for.

,stocks,"Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK’s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I'm doing this for myself so thought it'd be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays.

Planning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there’s no interest in this, then I’ll stop posting).

**Why ARK?**

* Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an [internal annual hurdle rate of 15%](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf) based on a 5-year time horizon
* But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes ***too*** **tolerant of overly stretched valuations**
* As a result, I’m hoping to give you the **best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,** all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies

   * **Trading at less than 70% of the 52 week high** \- provides context around market sentiment
   * **Greater than 25% LTM revenue growth** \- guide for the future
   * **Greater than 60% LTM gross margins** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM cash flow positive** \- operational efficiency
   * **LTM Revenue multiple of less than 15x** \- valuation
* Given that the market is a bit bearish right now and punishing stocks with stretched valuations, I’m heavily weighting the valuation criteria as you’ll see soon

**The Top 5 Picks of the Week**

* **2U - a leading edtech company**
   * 52 week high discount: 41%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 71%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 0%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 3.3x
   * Commentary: Most software companies are trading 20-30x with these types of fundamentals, so based on the valuation, 2U seems very promising
* **Baidu - a Chinese AI and internet conglomerate**
   * 52 week high discount: 26%
   * LTM revenue growth: 46%
   * LTM gross margins: 48%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 33%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 4.7x
   * Commentary: Really great financial figures and super low revenue multiple, but do keep in mind that there’s always heightened risk when investing in Chinese companies
* **PagerDuty - an incident response software company**
   * 52 week high discount: 36%
   * LTM revenue growth: 27%
   * LTM gross margins: 87%
   * LTM cash flow positive: (35%)
   * EV / LTM revenue: 13.1x
   * Commentary: The company is in its growing phase so that’s why I’m forgiving of its negative 35% free cash flow margin and a 13.1x revenue multiple seems very fair for this kind of financial profile for a software company. Keep in mind these are EV / LTM revenue multiples, so this multiple is even lower for NTM but I just don’t have that data.
* **Teradyne - a test equipment manufacturing company whose customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, and more**
   * 52 week high discount: 23%
   * LTM revenue growth: 34%
   * LTM gross margins: 57%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 5.8x
   * Commentary: Based on the growth rate, margins, and valuation, seems like a bargain
* **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - primarily makes chips**
   * 52 week high discount: 15%
   * LTM revenue growth: 33%
   * LTM gross margins: 53%
   * LTM cash flow positive: 29%
   * EV / LTM revenue: 11.4x
   * Commentary: The company isn’t trading at much of a discount relative to the others at 85% but I chose this company because there has been some news I came across recently of a chip shortage, which means there is incredible demand for TSMC’s products

**Edit:** One thing I forgot to add - there's obviously a lot more to investing than just numbers. And it's very possible that the numbers I share each week has an important story behind it (i.e. an inflated revenue figure due to an acquisition rather than organic growth). So as I mentioned earlier in the post, please view this as a starting point of research and I'm not necessarily recommending all these as buys. Just that they are attractive from a financial perspective + it helps that the ARK team vetted the company.",t2_9zq0i096,False,,1,False,ARKK (Innovation Fund) Top 5 Stock Picks - Week Ending 3/7/21,[],r/stocks,False,6,tickerdiscussion,0,,False,t3_m038nl,False,dark,0.95,,public,124,3,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Company Discussion,False,124,,True,,1615162763.0,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1615191007.0,text,6,,,text,self.stocks,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey All, each Sunday, I plan to pick 5 stocks from ARK’s funds that are most attractive from a fundamental perspective (i.e. growth rates, margins, valuation). I&amp;#39;m doing this for myself so thought it&amp;#39;d be helpful to share with others before trading begins on Mondays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning to do this for the Innovation (ARKK) fund today, then the autonomous tech next week, then next gen internet, then fintech before the whole cycle repeats. (Unless it turns out that there’s no interest in this, then I’ll stop posting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why ARK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though ARK’s strategy can be seen as overhyped and controversial, what I do like about the fund is that they are growth-focused with an &lt;a href=""https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/Marketing_Material/ARKInvest_122019_ESG-Policy.pdf""&gt;internal annual hurdle rate of 15%&lt;/a&gt; based on a 5-year time horizon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But, I think ARK tends to be on the optimistic end of the spectrum and sometimes &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;tolerant of overly stretched valuations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a result, I’m hoping to give you the &lt;strong&gt;best of both worlds: high growth stock picks at the most attractive prices,&lt;/strong&gt; all by using ARK’s ETF picks as a filter for vetted, high-growth companies

&lt;/ul&gt;

Curious what everyone's take is on this one. I've never seen a stock more hyped by analysists yet it continues to perform extremely poorly. Pretty much anywhere you look, it's marked BUY!

,stocks,"The GME situation has me thinking: What is the optimal way to play a squeeze? It's ridiculously hard to find any information regarding the specific trades you should be doing to exit a squeeze in which you have a long position in. Obviously you want to sell near the peak to maximize gains, but the peak is never known beforehand.

Because squeezes aren't that common, there isn't much data available to develop a hypothesis around. For this reason, this will mostly have to be speculation.

Even though squeezes themselves may be rare, the concept of a stock going up rapidly and each investor put into a prison's dilemma ensues more often than this.

So how to optimally play this is the question. Let's also use the hypothetical of GME going to $150 -&gt; $10,000 over a day as an example. Obviously, you don't *know* it's going to go up that high.

 *  What should you be doing during the ride up? Constantly set sell limits 50% above current? Refresh your stop limit to stay under $100 below current?

 * What *the hell* does the ride down look like? It seems likely that quite literally nobody would be trying to buy a stock that is going from $10,000 -&gt; $20 rapidly. **Can you even sell during the ride down?** It feels like nobody would be buying at that point.

 * How necessary is it to form a selling plan early? If you're trying to just wing-it and watch, is this even a viable option. Or would you be placing your sell limit @ $9,000 when it's down in the hundreds?

,stocks,"It’s clear the narrative of the market right now is about the rotation from growth to value stocks. There are going to be a lot of fearful investors moving their money, and a lot of fund managers buying up value stocks to please their skittish customers. 

So I started looking for stocks with a low P/E ratio and the highest StarMine scores. StarMine is a scoring system used on Fidelity and some other brokers which uses an aggregate of analyst ratings. In other words, these stocks are universally rated buy and a likely target of cautious investors, and their low P/E puts them into the value basket. I’m not trying to get complicated. I’m looking for undervalued stocks with mainstream surface appeal. 

(Important to note that I am not saying StarMine scores are an accurate ranking of stocks, but only that I'm using them a proxy for where mainstream money will go during this rotation.)

The first group is what I’ll call Value Boomer Bait:
 
* StarMine Equity Score of 9.1 or higher
* Consumer discretionary company with a household name  
* P/E ratio below 18

This gives you four good leads:

* WILLIAMS-SONOMA (WSM)
* AUTONATION (AN)
* JACK IN THE BOX (JACK)
* 1-800-FLOWERS.COM (FLWS)

Two similar leads without household names are AMERICA'S CAR-MART (CRMT) and HAVERTY FURNITURE (HVT).

The second group of obvious value stocks I found are some undervalued recreational boating companies with steady growth. ONEWATER MARINE (ONEW) and MARINEMAX (HZO) are high-end boat retailers, both with a StarMine score of 9.7, both with a P/E ratio of 11.9, and both with steady growth that was unaffected by the market sell-off. You can also look at BRUNSWICK CORP (BC), a manufacturer of boat components, which has a StarMine score of 9.4 and a P/E of 19.3. 

A lot of people have been looking at homebuilding recently, so here’s the homebuilders with a StarMine Score of 9.1 or higher and a P/E below 12:

* GREEN BRICK PARTNERS (GRBK)
* CENTURY COMMUNITIES (CCS)
* BEAZER HOMES USA (BZH)

And finally, here is a list of the top StarMine Equity Score by each sector, so I’m guessing you’ll see inflows into each of these:

Comm. Serv.

* 8.7 LUMN Lumen

Cons. Disc.

* 10.0 ASO Academy

Cons. Stap.

* 9.8 BG Bunge

* 9.2 DVN Devon Energy

* 10.0 SF Stifel Financial

* 9.8 HOLX Hologic

Info. Tech.

* 10.0 LOGI Logitech

Materials

* 9.7 Tronox

Real Estate

* 9.8 IIPR Innovative Ind Properties

Utilities

* 8.7 AY Atlantica

Obviously this is just a starting point for capturing the mainstream money, but I think there are some good buys here if you want to add value stocks. Or you could throw a dart and pick any of about 30 financial stocks that are universally rated buy. My picks are: 

* ROYAL CANADIAN (RY, 9.4 StarMine, 11 P/E)
* CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK (CM, 9.4 StarMine, 10 P/E)
* ENSTAR GROUP (ESGR, 10.0 StarMine, 3 P/E)

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is just a starting point for capturing the mainstream money, but I think there are some good buys here if you want to add value stocks. Or you could throw a dart and pick any of about 30 financial stocks that are universally rated buy. My picks are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ROYAL CANADIAN (RY, 9.4 StarMine, 11 P/E)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK (CM, 9.4 StarMine, 10 P/E)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ENSTAR GROUP (ESGR, 10.0 StarMine, 3 P/E)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VIRTU (VIRT, 9.9 StarMine, 5 P/E)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t own any of these yet, but I&amp;#39;m going to do some more research tonight and pick a basket of them for Monday morning. Good luck everyone and happy hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

I bought some VOO shares (12) at around 350 a share a bit ago - I now am worried about an impending market crash of some significance based off of no real research, just a general feeling of unease.

Is there any sense in selling VOO shares now to get my money back, and then holding on to that money in an attempt to re-buy when the prices drop down if a crash occurs?

How flawed is this reasoning? I'm assuming there is something here i'm missing, so just figured i'd ask.

Shouldn't bond yield always be higher than inflation rate?

So I'm just thinking why would anyone want to buy bond if they will lose money because the bond yield is below inflation rate?  Do these people just have so much money that their primary goal is **wealth preservation**?  They don't even care to make more money?

--

But even so, if they want to preserve wealth, index fund is safe and grows on an average 7% annually.  MUCH better than bond yield to me.  The market long term will always go up.

All the rules of r/Stocks still apply, so please see the sidebar or [click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/rules)

**But here's the twist** you can't bring up meme stocks that have been hotly discussed in the past several weeks.  Those stocks that everyone has been talking about, you can't bring up here or they'll be autoremoved.  Why?  It's to keep this thread pure &amp; focused.

The current [list of meme stocks can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/meme-stocks)  So don't mention these stocks in this post or your comment will be removed.

Disclaimer: I became interested in the market exactly when you’d expect. I’m only a poor med school student, but my recent surgery gave me plenty of time to scour rabbit holes for what the Hell happened since late January. I think concern for the actions of millions like me are valid, but I have a genuine passion for understanding new things and couldn’t refrain from investigating a situation so complex. I hope you don’t hold my ignorance against me.

So I’ve been periodically looking at live bid-ask data for a particular security, and I noticed about a week ago, during a significant price spike, that there were constant buy orders (and some sell orders) for 73 shares. I figured it had to do with options but I couldn’t find similar orders in books for other securities. There were very few, if any, buy orders for 27 shares. Until today.

“Amazon orders more than 1000 natural gas powered engines...” What’s their play here? Why natural gas when it doesn’t meet zero emissions? 

Simply put, the answer is renewable natural gas (RNG). If you read the news from major fleet operators the past two years, they are ALL relying on RNG and making major commitments to RNG, at least for the next decade. Amazon, for one, is well aware that the nat gas engines can utilize RNG. This strategically puts them in a position to meet zero emission standards. UPS has made HUGE commitments to RNG going as far as purchasing large supplies of RNG with commitments up to 2026. FedEx as well. Anheuser-Busch with Agility... list goes on. Theme here for major fleet operators is RNG. Existing natural gas infrastructure is there unlike electric infrastructure. The only question in the future is can supply meet increased demand? 

What is the advantage of Hyliion’s primary product Hypertruck ERX set to debut this year? Electrification powered by RNG! This means more miles than conventional nat gas RNG trucks AND less demand on RNG = cost savings aka the perfect solution. I think with this understanding of current environment, we can expect to hear some major announcements and deals in the future with ERX.

,stocks,"While the media has drew a clear linkage between recent yield spikes (particularly on the 10 yr) and inflationary worries to the corrections in growth stocks - I believe the true reason that the market has been spooked is because the perceived transition from a Fed-based market (back into) an economy-based market.

As market participants are betting on the end of Covid pandemic is near, one realization is that the Fed will gradually decelerate QE and eventually stop “babysitting” the market. Recent yield 10 Yr spikes and comments made by JPowell could have been seen as evidence to back up this expectation. 

In short, since the start of the pandemic, the Fed has encouraged cheap lending and borrowing via purchasing long term securities such as the 10yr vía open market which artificially increased bond prices thus suppressing yield; the unprofitability of long term assets has then led a big influx into more liquid assets such as cash (known commonly as “liquidity traps” to increase money supply). 

Given the subsequent abundance of liquidity, risky assets, especially those of more speculative nature such as growth stocks then saw very strong momentum during these cheap money environments
since participants are now fully “risk-on”.

However, with vaccines becoming widely available and an economic re-opening appears to be imminent, market participants are sensing that perhaps soon, QE will decelerate as Fed let go of the leash. Evidently, recently bonds sell offs which led yields to spike at a worrisome pace led participants to further believe Fed is ready to “let go” and eventually preparing for transition back into an economy-based market. 

Given the above, I think the above will at least partly justify why some of the richly valued growth stocks have been selling off; while re-opening stocks outperformed. I think at this points, perhaps hints of YCC can quickly stop the tech hemorrhage; otherwise the market will continue to remain volatile until an equilibrium is found. 

Please let me know your thoughts! 

TLDR: 1) the recent correction of growth stocks is likely due to the uncertainties faced by participants caught in midst of a transition from a Fed-based market back into an economy-based market.

ARK is very appealing to me and I&amp;#39;ve been reading up alot on their different ETFs and I&amp;#39;ve seen alot of talk about ARKK, obviously, and ARKF. Other then ARKK, the one that catches my eye the most is ARKQ but I don&amp;#39;t ever see anyone talking about or mentioning it really. It seems to me like it has massive potential as autonomous cars come closer to reality. The number 1 occupation world wide is drivers, wether that be cabs, delivery, long haul trucking, etc. That&amp;#39;s ALOT of companies that would benefit massively from removing that labour cost, which to me would translate to a massive interest in buying those technologies when they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

Good company dragged down by the recent overall Chinese market and EV sector declines. Growth is good and they’re one of the only profitable EV companies and still under 3b market cap. Biggest challenge/potential catalyst is expanding to international markets. The current price is very good imo.

* The PE is only 9.62 and the forward PE is even lower


* The growth past 5 years was 37.80%, and this is reflected with the rapidly increasing share price (Around 400% in 5 years!). Next 5 years are expected to do even better with 63.70% for next 5 years. EPS next 5Y 63.70% (based on Finviz numbers).


* The ROE is 54.20%


* it got oversold in the short term so it should be a good entry point.


* The company has great potential in the EV industry, but does not 100% rely on it.


I believe MTOR is a nice combination of value play (very low PE) while also having a very good potential of growth. It had an insane growth last 5 years and it was ""real growth"", not just hype, and there are no reasons to believe it is going to slow down.

I see a lot of doom and gloom regarding what may be a coming market correction.  

&amp;nbsp;

Do you think the elites/wealthy only make money in up markets?

&amp;nbsp;

I understand if youre currently in a stock and its value has dipped quite a bit over the last few days/weeks.

&amp;nbsp;

That can be concerning. 

&amp;nbsp;

However, history has shown us that over the longer term, solid companies generally recover and continue to climb.  

&amp;nbsp;

If you do have any cash on the sidelines or are thinking about taking a loss and trying to recover in other plays, there are ""options"".

&amp;nbsp;

The time may be upon us when it makes more sense to sell short, buy puts and scalp for short term gains.  

&amp;nbsp;

And if there is a market correction specifically due to inflation, theres money to be made there as well.

I did well as a buy-and-holder, but in the 2020 crash got serious about learning to read a chart and see whether I should be holding the stocks I'm holding. A big breakthrough game when I started watching The Daily Bar on [Stockcharts.com](https://Stockcharts.com), which is super helpful. David Keller calmly unpacks the actions of the market that day, telling what underperformed and why he thought that was.

He also maintains his Mindful Investor Chartlist, which is a calm way to go over the markets. I'll post some of his current charts here. Sadly I cannot post inline graphics because this isn't allowed here, but I've got imgur links to follow along with below.

Dave uses a long-term, medium-term and short-term trend system that shows here. The long term trend is still bullish, short and medium flipped bearish. This just means wait and see.

The above shows how four groups of stocks the NYSE Composite (a bunch of different stocks), then the SPY large, mid-cap and small cap, are all doing. If there are weird divergences, such as one group breaking down while others aren't, you can get some info here.

This shows how many stocks are above the 200 day, vs how many are above their 50 day. Clearly it shows stocks are breaking down, which is something you can see a lot sooner than the present crisis.

Consumer discretionary should outperform consumer staples in good times. This shows XLY (which is mostly Amazon and Home Depot) is dipping, but the equal wait versions (in the middle) show things are just fine. Just because Amazon is falling doesn't mean the average stock here is doing bad.

I admit I rarely pay attention to the book value for fast-growth stocks as it is generally a very small number compared to the market cap. However I was surprised by this number of TDOC, as 1.8 is the number for a big blue chip, not a number for growth tech companies. If this is a valid number, then the stock is very much undervalued.

However, when I looked at the history of the price-to-book ratio, I found there is a sudden jump of book value at the end of 2020 (from 13-14 to \~2 in one day, between 12/30 and 12/31). This suggests a sudden change of the valuation of certain asset, maybe overvaluation. Anyone knows what happened there?

PFE is expected to gain $15 billion in increase revenue because of the covid vaccine in 2021, which is a 20-30% increase in revenue. I don't think this is priced in yet.

**The Trade:**

Buy long dated calls. PFE volatility is super low and calls are cheap AF. I bought 50 delta September calls for \~$200.

**Now expanding on this:**

\- Yes PFE stock price shot up and back down in December, bc of the news of FDA approval. People got scared out of their positions and the price dropped way wayyy back down, and its at a solid support to buy from right now.  high upside, low downside at this point.

\- The operational costs, and research &amp; development costs were priced in last year, (for the most part). This is why they had low earnings last year. They had the upfront operational costs for the vaccine, but they had no actual revenue yet, bc the vaccine had not been distributed.

\- Expected 2 billion doses to deliver by end of 2021, but may change if additional contracts are signed. So there is even more potential revenue growth. The revenue growth will probably peak in 2021 and taper off in 2022. However, the view of Pfizer CEO Dr. Albert Bourla is, "" I think COVID has a very good chance that could completely transform the revenue and earnings trajectory of this business starting now.""

\- There is a ton of negative attention on PFE stock right now. It seems to be nothing to do with the fundamentals, but just the fact that the stock is boring and not moving. But there has been the idea floating around that the covid vaccine isnt a money maker. I actually thought this myself before i started to research it.  Here is some of the ridiculous negative comments [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnowlf/why_did_game_changing_vaccine_stocks_like_pfe/)

\- Diving a little deeper into the trade idea. Buying calls is a brilliant play and credit goes to an article I read by Trevor Soare. PFE is sitting at a historic lows of implied volatility (IV). This means calls are cheap. Next earnings will be in 2 months, so there will be an increase in volatility up until that point. So my calls will gain value even if the stock price doesnt move. This will also provide some cushing even if the stock price does go down.

,stocks,"So I've been reading up on naked shorting since people talk about how illegal it is when it's not and instead how it's actually legal for Hedge funds to do them as long as they find the borrow within 21 days or else it turns in to a Failure-to-Delivery (FTD)

--------------------

In case you don't know either of those terms:

**Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud. Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.

**Fails–to–Deliver** — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.

------------------------

However, it doesn't explain the consequences of a FTD from naked shorts.

I started investing in a moment, which was very unusual. It was April 2020. No matter what I bought, it soared almost 100% in just a few weeks.

Now, being relatively new to investing, the last 3-4 weeks of volatility changed my newcomer mindset from „buy, keep for a few days, sell with profit“ to „choose carefully“. 

As we all found out, a lot of the overhyped companies are or were massively overvalued, as the current correction is showing us. Therefore I want to „repair“ my portfolio and concentrate only on good, healthy long-term growth stocks, which can survive the test of time.

In my process of researching, I have 6 favorites so far: SQUARE, PAYPAL, MASTERCARD, VISA, SHOPIFY, AMAZON.

What do you think about them and what would you choose?

$ARCT - This is a great value at tgus price and a strong support as well. There is a very slight uptrend as well. good price, all indicators are low; I like it a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

$AUPH - Another great support within this channel and we are at a great value right here. Indicators all low and showing some life which is great.

&amp;#x200B;

$DDOG - Just another great value play, with low indicators with plenty of room to run up.

&amp;#x200B;

$DKNG - A little high for me, so I am going to wait for a better price myself. Indicatotrs all low, and seems to be done with earnings plays.

&amp;#x200B;

$FIVN - Trend line held super well. Support is right here and looks really good and strong, so it is a good play here. If it can hold up here we may see the POC Shift up.

&amp;#x200B;

$GRNQ - Great uptrend for a penny stock. Super strong support and has massive breakout history. Could make or break your portfolio if you play this though.

&amp;#x200B;

$KNDI - Really great penny stock setup right here. Good value for sure, indicators are super low as well.

&amp;#x200B;

$PSNL - We have one of my favorite stocks just die into value. Used to bounce off the 200EMA like a dream, but now we are going to tryand get into it at this strong support.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$AUPH - Another great support within this channel and we are at a great value right here. Indicators all low and showing some life which is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$DDOG - Just another great value play, with low indicators with plenty of room to run up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$DKNG - A little high for me, so I am going to wait for a better price myself. Indicatotrs all low, and seems to be done with earnings plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$FIVN - Trend line held super well. Support is right here and looks really good and strong, so it is a good play here. If it can hold up here we may see the POC Shift up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$GRNQ - Great uptrend for a penny stock. Super strong support and has massive breakout history. Could make or break your portfolio if you play this though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$KNDI - Really great penny stock setup right here. Good value for sure, indicators are super low as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$PSNL - We have one of my favorite stocks just die into value. Used to bounce off the 200EMA like a dream, but now we are going to tryand get into it at this strong support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$SMAR - Gorgeous uptrend, and we have a very strong support here. Right above volume as well so I think this is a great value bullish play as well.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"So like many of us, I've been following this movement with meme stocks very closely wondering if there is money to be made other than just some quick day/swing trades. I've done a ton of research, specifically on AMC because although many expect the ""squeeze"" for GME to be much more likely, the price it's at is very unrealistic and so IF it doesn't happen, then there's not much in terms of future value with a stock already prices that high. Basically it seems much more reliant on a squeeze than anything for your investment. 

AMC I'm looking at with a slightly different view.. yes it is a meme stock, yes it is overpriced at the moment, yes they have been bleeding money due to Covid..

But with all that said, apart from just the ""potential"" for a squeeze, this surge in price they were able to capitalize on and sell shares to raise funds last month to reduce their debt significantly. They also gained an extremely high amount of publicity and sentiment from the public, they have now discussed the option to issue even more shares (which will be kept basically in the war chest by the sounds of it) and I believe they have a very positive plan for them.

These shares can be used for many things, not just in a negative way by diluting shares to raise capital (which if they went this route, I'm sure they would have BIG plans for that money). Instead I think it may be used for positive things like dividends or a stock split. 

Think about it, the company was in the dirt on the brink of bankruptcy and was/still is being heavily shorted.. why not make the big brain move and reward investors who saved them, and screw over the short sellers who tried to destroy them? Is this not what Tesla did? 

Of course, they are losing money, the Earnings report on Wednesday will show this. But that's not at all what I'm thinking about, investors these days aren't just buying things that make sense from a financial perspective. There is reports and facts backing that up.. So I'm actually fairly optimistic that they will release some big news with plans to grow and thrive long term. Is that a bit speculative? Sure, but they would be very smart to do this while everyone is riding the wave. 

They know they need to make change, thus my thinking of the current price actually a fairly reasonable price point. Not because of the current financials, but because of the sentiment behind what is currently happening and basically the value many are seeing just by holding and having faith that the company will improve its business model and come out with progressive growth ideas for the future. 

I'm NOT the typical meme stock investor relying on the potential squeeze. I am optimistic about the long term potential here, and think the downside risk is actually not as big as people think (unlike GME at its current price). When I say long term potential, I'm thinking maybe $12-15 over the next year or so? Do I hope it can be higher? Of course, but I think that's on the safe side, while my downside price point is around $6. So I definitely see a higher reward vs risk potential in AMC. 

There are plenty of other DD posts around if you are looking for some numbers to back this thought/theory up. I have read all of them, and have come up with this prediction on my own. 

Let me know your thoughts, I'm very open to reasons why this is NOT possible!

So I started to diversify in the direction that I care the most about - ETF Clean Energy, Sustainable companies (ex. Blackrock), etc. (and I will admit, still have a good chunk in ETF World, which includes as well terrible companies, therefore I am trying to slowly dissociate from the ETF).

,stocks,"I'm probably wrong because I'm very new to ask this but I was wondering if someone could explain why.

Everybody is saying that the stock market is going down because of the higher yield in bonds. I get why that would happen. I know it COULD be the reason. I don't want an explanation about why higher bond yields affect growth stocks.

However, would it be possible that there would be a bond selloff for some other reason at the same time as a stock selloff, making it seem like one is causing the other?

Of course, a bond selloff drives the price of bonds down and thus its yield up.

Is there something that shows us that bond yield is going up for some other reason than a bond selloff?

Edit: Someone asked so here is my theory about the cause of all this:

I think there is enormous pressure on the short sellers, which make a up a huge part of the market to close their positions because of margin calls. A lot of stocks with VERY high short interest have been going steadily up (like GME, to name the biggest one) and the short sellers need to liquidate both their bonds and their stocks to pay for those overpriced stocks and close their positions.

,stocks,"Hello investors,

As we await for another tumultuous week ahead, I wanted to share a strategy with the group to help mitigate some of the risks embedded in our portfolios.

Quick reminder, my goal is to share the things I was taught in hopes to not only help educate others but also to remind myself of those key lessons because I often forget them myself.

I understand many people have started trading this past year and that is exactly why I started this forum. I'd hate to see people lose their hard-earned money but more importantly, give up on the game without learning anything.

Two parts to this memo: market thoughts and hedging strategy.

**1) My view on the markets right now.**

Like I mentioned in this memo, this correction is more concerning than the ones we've experienced recently, specifically the September 2020 selloff. It's because of the inflation expectations, rising yields, and Fed's complacency on letting the long-end rates soar, all of which together triggered MOVE index to tick higher. (MOVE index is the interest rate volatility index, similar to the VIX index for stocks)

📷

Not only higher volatility but also a steeper yield curve.

📷

What I also talked about in the memo is that I am not as worried about this correction because of the following reasons.

\- Liquidity in the markets is strong.

\- Fed has been constantly emphasizing its continued support to the proper functioning of the markets.

\- Fiscal spending is not going away.

\- Expected economic recovery

Given the limited data resources, this is the best of what I could find from CapIQ to assess the short-term lending conditions.

📷

Also from what I found on other sources, it seems that the short-term borrowing rates are holding steady, most likely because of the expected cash dump by the Treasury (see the memo for what I'm referring to) and Fed's short-term Treasury purchases.

Not only the liquidity but the Fed and fiscal spending have been the primary drivers of the markets in the past few months, neither of which is going away anytime soon.

Lastly, the expected economic recovery given the vaccine rollout and pent-up demand will likely support the markets for an upward bounce.

Below chart shows the market sentiment as to how bearish the market participants are. It seems to me it's getting more attractive to buy into the markets because the higher the ratio, more bearish the sentiment is.

📷

Ideally, I would want to get charts for FRA-OIS 3 month spread (up to date, most are available as of 2/26), commercial paper spread, and S&amp;P 500 put-call ratio. But what I have right now seems to be sufficient enough to know that we are not headed for a severe market malfunctioning.

C**ombining all of those, I think it's more likely that we are going to see a deeper correction given the technical indicators but I have a very low conviction on this call and we can never time the bottom so my guess is just as good as yours. I do, however, have a higher conviction that we'll see a market recovery and it's wise to slowly buy into dip.** The best way to behave in a correction is to continue to monitor individual names and determine if they're cheap enough to buy or not.

**2) How to hedge yourself**

I should probably have posted this way before to prepare people for a correction like this and my apologies for it.

I will tell you how I try to hedge myself and this is something that works for me but it may not work for others because everyone's risk tolerance is different. Please keep that in mind when you are reading this.

Here's what I typically do. Please realize that this is a rough outline of what I do and by no means everyone should follow these steps.

📷

After a correction of more than 10%, I start buying into the selloff more aggressively. I may be trying to catch a falling knife but I'm willing to risk losing that money for the potential reward in a market recovery.

When the market breaks the previous high and rises a bit more, I start slowly hedging myself by buying short-term debit put spreads.

Here are instances where I bought the hedges.

📷

As you can see, my timing is terrible. I began buying the hedges more than 2 months before the actual corrections happened. As a result, I lost a substantial amount of money through hedges.

Specifically, this is the type of put spread I buy.

Long leg

Expiration: 2 months

Strike price: 5-10% lower than the current underlying

Short leg:

Expiration: 2 months

Strike price: 10-15% lower than the current underlying

The idea you are trying to express through the combo of these two legs is that I expect the markets to correct anywhere between 10-15% in the next two months.

If the market corrects more than 10%, I gain on the long. If the market corrects less than 15%, I gain on the short.

The reason why I like this spread more than outright naked puts, straddles, or covered calls is that it requires low capital, you can express your view on the markets better, and it is simpler than other strategies.

**I am no expert in options and I would like to keep things as simple and as easy to understand as possible.**

If you were to execute the said hedging strategy today, here's what I would buy. In fact, I bought this spread on 3/1 when QQQ was $320 and I still have it. I only bought it for no other reason than simply following the 5 steps outlined above.

📷

Long leg: 5/21/2021P $280 $7.67 ask price

Short leg: 5/21/2021P $260 $4.33 bid price

The net premium that I have to put up is $3.26.

It's cheaper than paying $7.67 to buy put option but still protects me just as much when QQQ drops.

This is the performance profile showing what happens today if QQQ moves +/- 10% today or by the expiration date (May 21st), from Interactive Brokers platform.

📷

You can see that if QQQ drops 5% today, I get $184.20 in gains and 10% drop gives me $420.24.

If QQQ is down by 10% by 4/7/2021 instead, a month later, then you gain $385.37 on this spread.

📷

Lastly, we gain $1666 if QQQ is down to $260 by the expiration date 5/21/2021 or lose the entire premium ($334, different from the above mentioned net premium because of mid-price convention) if QQQ is above $280.

📷

The scenarios sound pretty attractive to me. If I expected QQQ to drop from $300 today to $260 today (more than 10% correction), then this spread does a good job hedging. If QQQ closes above $280 (7% drawdown), I only lose $334.

**Now we know which spread to buy but how much should we buy?** The answer depends on how much of the portfolio you want to hedge.

There is a concept called a delta-neutral portfolio. This simply means that if you have a $100k in stocks, you have just as much in options that will offset any gains or losses, thus delta-neutralizing the portfolio.

For instance, look at the long leg we talked about before. 5/21/2021P $280.

📷

We can easily calculate what the ""Delta Dollar"" is for this put option.

You have a delta of -0.238, or -23.8%, and the underlying (QQQ) is $309.

$309 x -23.8% x 100 = -$7,354

Underlying price x delta x multiplier = delta dollar

In plain English, this means that buying the put option is equivalent to shorting $7,354 of QQQ.

So if you have $7,354 in QQQ, this put will make your portfolio delta-neutral. $7,354 in QQQ - $7,354 in put option = 0.

A 1% decline in QQQ will increase your put value by $73.5 (1% of the delta dollar) but will decrease your QQQ shares by $73.5 so it evens out.

As you can see, you gain $82.6 on your put option if QQQ declines by 1%, slightly different than the $73.5 we calculated because delta actually changes as the price of the underlying moves, which is a result of gamma but we won't get into that here and I will cover it in the later series.

📷

**The point is that buy as many spreads as you would like to delta neutralize your portfolio.**

If you are more bullish and only want to delta hedge only 50% of your portfolio, then you would buy enough number of spreads so that the total delta dollar equals 50% of your portfolio.

The good thing is that in most brokerages, there is a column called ""Delta Dollar"" that will calculate it for you, like the one below.

📷

This is not the longer one but the shorter QQQ put spread that I have and as you can see, it hedges $105,575 in dollar terms.

Please note the delta dollar changes every day based on the underlying price moves so if you are buying this spread, you have to frequently monitor the movements to make sure you are properly hedged.

**Summary**

Which leads me to my last point about hedging yourself.

I am a proponent of spending as little time as possible monitoring the markets because I would rather spend time understanding new companies, doing research, or learning some new trading strategy.

If you are buying short-term spreads, by definition you have to spend more time on trading so please keep that in mind.

The point of today's memo was to reiterate my thoughts on the markets and how to hedge yourself in tumultuous times like this.

&lt;p&gt;The net premium that I have to put up is $3.26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s cheaper than paying $7.67 to buy put option but still protects me just as much when QQQ drops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the performance profile showing what happens today if QQQ moves +/- 10% today or by the expiration date (May 21st), from Interactive Brokers platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that if QQQ drops 5% today, I get $184.20 in gains and 10% drop gives me $420.24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If QQQ is down by 10% by 4/7/2021 instead, a month later, then you gain $385.37 on this spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we gain $1666 if QQQ is down to $260 by the expiration date 5/21/2021 or lose the entire premium ($334, different from the above mentioned net premium because of mid-price convention) if QQQ is above $280.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenarios sound pretty attractive to me. If I expected QQQ to drop from $300 today to $260 today (more than 10% correction), then this spread does a good job hedging. If QQQ closes above $280 (7% drawdown), I only lose $334.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now we know which spread to buy but how much should we buy?&lt;/strong&gt; The answer depends on how much of the portfolio you want to hedge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a concept called a delta-neutral portfolio. This simply means that if you have a $100k in stocks, you have just as much in options that will offset any gains or losses, thus delta-neutralizing the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, look at the long leg we talked about before. 5/21/2021P $280.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can easily calculate what the &amp;quot;Delta Dollar&amp;quot; is for this put option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a delta of -0.238, or -23.8%, and the underlying (QQQ) is $309.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$309 x -23.8% x 100 = -$7,354&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlying price x delta x multiplier = delta dollar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plain English, this means that buying the put option is equivalent to shorting $7,354 of QQQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you have $7,354 in QQQ, this put will make your portfolio delta-neutral. $7,354 in QQQ - $7,354 in put option = 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1% decline in QQQ will increase your put value by $73.5 (1% of the delta dollar) but will decrease your QQQ shares by $73.5 so it evens out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, you gain $82.6 on your put option if QQQ declines by 1%, slightly different than the $73.5 we calculated because delta actually changes as the price of the underlying moves, which is a result of gamma but we won&amp;#39;t get into that here and I will cover it in the later series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The point is that buy as many spreads as you would like to delta neutralize your portfolio.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are more bullish and only want to delta hedge only 50% of your portfolio, then you would buy enough number of spreads so that the total delta dollar equals 50% of your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing is that in most brokerages, there is a column called &amp;quot;Delta Dollar&amp;quot; that will calculate it for you, like the one below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the longer one but the shorter QQQ put spread that I have and as you can see, it hedges $105,575 in dollar terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note the delta dollar changes every day based on the underlying price moves so if you are buying this spread, you have to frequently monitor the movements to make sure you are properly hedged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads me to my last point about hedging yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a proponent of spending as little time as possible monitoring the markets because I would rather spend time understanding new companies, doing research, or learning some new trading strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are buying short-term spreads, by definition you have to spend more time on trading so please keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of today&amp;#39;s memo was to reiterate my thoughts on the markets and how to hedge yourself in tumultuous times like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading and please feel free to provide me with any feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a classic issue of short term surge in supply while demand is not able to expand at such quick pace. But there is a simple solution that has proven to work. 

The Fed can relax the calculation on bank’s required capital holding  (last utilized in April last year). The issue with the swing in yield is also largely driven by the fact that the scale of the auction has skyrocketed while the trading market itself has not kept pace.

This way the bank does not have the pressure to unload these treasuries quickly thus helping to ease the pressure from the short term supply surge.

What's your opinion on the Outlook of a few companies such as Lucid, Arrival, Tesla, Canoo, or even Hyliion?

Personally, I've been buying as much of Canoo as I can. Using the proceeds from selling Covered Calls, I have been buying a bit of everything except for Tesla as I believe it to still be way too overvalued.

It's no doubt we are in a bit of an EV bubble, and some if not most of these companies and the others may not make it in the end.

Lucid, while have such a huge market cap with no real product yet...seems to have plenty of high powered investors in...namely Black rock and Saudi money

Arrival, another big name allegedly that has contracts with Amazon to build buses and delivery vans. 

Tesla....you guys already know.

Canoo, it's a bit of a weird one. Offering multiple vehicles from delivery vans, consumer subscription vans, trucks, sedans...and all using the same chassis or ""skateboard"". Interest from Alibaba and Apple, alongside contracts with Kia/Hyundai, definitely makes it something to keep an eye on imo.

Hyliion, they are attempting to take on the 18 wheeler market by offering hybrid EV trucks. While seemingly a competitor to Tesla's truck offering, their CEO does seem a bit.... Eccentric. But maybe it's not a bad thing. 


Weirdly enough, most of these new EV companies, save for Tesla, don't necessarily have a product on the road just yet. Most aiming for 2022-2025 product releases.

While comparing numbers like 5 year growth estimates on yahoo finance, I noticed that the stocks being traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange TSE had a negative 5 YR projected growth, while the same stock on the NYSE had a positive 5 YR projected growth. I found the 5YR projected growth figures under yahoo finance &gt; Analysis &gt; scroll all the way to the bottom for Growth Estimates.

I'm assuming this is abnormal? I would like to point out that I know I shouldn't put too much weight on these projections, but the discrepancy is jarring. Here is a couple of examples I found below: Suncor and Air Canada. In parenthesis are the expected 5YR annualized growth figures.

Imperial Oil NYSE (+18.1%): [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/IMO/analysis?p=IMO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/IMO/analysis?p=IMO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)

Imperial Oil TSX (-11.1%): [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/IMO.TO/analysis?p=IMO.TO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/IMO.TO/analysis?p=IMO.TO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)

Suncor NYSE (+12.6%): [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SU/analysis?p=SU&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SU/analysis?p=SU&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)

Suncor TSX (-15.3%): [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SU.TO/analysis?p=SU.TO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/SU.TO/analysis?p=SU.TO&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)

 Could this be a bug related to exchange rates or something? Which data would you guys see as more reliable? I think the NYSE data is probably more reliable. However I could be missing something big here, excuse my ignorance.

My question is ehy would you buy an option OTM (say current share price is $10 and I bought an option for $13) why not always just buy the option at current share proce and hope it goes up as a much as possible?

That would be better than me buying an option for that same stock with a strike of $12 the share price went to $14. I would have made more money buying at the current $10 strike.

Teva is grossly undervalued. The CEO restructured the company cutting all the dead weight in the last couple of years making it profitable while it’s making more billions in revenue than its current market cap. Teva is saving lives by making cheaper, generic product of expensive medicine that would otherwise not be affordable. Unlike other huge pharma companies already worth 100s of billions of dollars, Teva market cap is low by comparison with an extremely low P/E ratio and has potential to 10x in value. Unlike recent stocks that already increased 5000% in a couple months where people are fomoing in at the top, this ship has not sailed yet. Its price is the lowest it has been in decades so getting in now has lower risk but a huge upside.

The price right now is %80+ lower than all time high which was \~6 years ago. It has spent more time in the last 2 decades at more than double this price and is gravitating back to the 20-30 range in the near future, especially when considering inflation. Its last stock split was in 2004 where its price was around $28 and only increased in following years until 2016. Inflation since then till now is %40+, meaning if it kept up with inflation the price now should be at around $40 but it is available for $10.5. 

There is also a decent amount of shorts trying to keep the price down during this period of consolidation so people (and some huge investors) will lose interest and sell the bottom while the shorts can eventually load up their bags at such low prices on the way back up. However, there is starting to be a lot more interest and traction for the price to increase in the last year as it sets a new trend to make a come back.

Disclaimer: I hold some Teva because I like and believe in it. However, unlike some shills I am not saying I like the price point After it increases 10x in a short time period and saying it is a safe, low risk high reward buy at that price point.

Lastly, Teva literally means nature and who doesn’t like nature.

,stocks,"The following is my summary of Cathie Wood’s thoughts on recent market volatility, as presented in her latest video on the Ark Invest YouTube channel (\~42 min) – I strongly recommend you check it out.

The minimum expected rate of return for a stock to enter an ark portfolio is 15% CAGR. Cathie contends that she sees the recent volatility as a gift to gain alpha over the intended 15% return in many of her high conviction names.

She mentions that at Ark, they have a five year time horizon, and it is counter productive to compare its performance with a benchmark (like the s&amp;p) over a shorter period. She further adds that many stocks in traditional indices today are a potential value trap, and that ark etfs “are a good hedge against broad based benchmarks.”

She reiterates that “we are not in a bubble” – and that the seeds of their 5 innovation platforms were planted in the dot com bubble, and are now ready for prime time, in a period of reality. Fear of a bubble likely stems from benchmark sensitivity and backward looking institutional investors. Furthermore, intuitions should be worried about their own strategies as “creative disruption will impact nearly 50% of the s&amp;p500”.

To Cathie, interest rates going up suggest that ‘real growth is going to pick up’ – and that she understands the concern over her own stock picks potentially underperforming as a result. However, she believes that that the market has assumed that interest rates will stabilize at a 4 to 5% range - which inversed (1/4 or 1/5) gives a normalized p/e of 20 or 25; so markets didn’t actually misprice assets to begin with. She thinks that nominal growth however, will not be at 4 to 5%, but instead around 2-3%, which can lead to greater valuation support for companies that can grow more rapidly.

Rotation from growth to value was also expected on her part. She repeats that value will face massive headwinds going forward. Energy and financial stocks have done amazing in the past month - which is a good thing as the bull market is broadening out unlike the dot com bubble, where ‘too much capital chased too few opportunities, too soon’.

,stocks,"As explained in [this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2021/03/04/rising-rates-are-great-for-the-stock-market-except-for-these-stocks/) (and many other places) as Treasury yields rise, stocks become less attractive (the ""equity risk premium"" decreases). However, since rising Treasury yields generally coincide with a growing economy, the lower equity risk premium is often offset by consumer demand etc driving up earnings and therefore share prices. But that boost isn't equally distributed throughout the market, so the rising bond market will affect some stocks more than others.

So there are two variables to consider: sensitivity to a rising bond market and gains from near term economic growth.

As I understand it, companies with valuations that are more heavily dependent on far future earnings will be most sensitive to interest rate hikes. That's because future cash flows have to be discounted more aggressively in an environment of rising Fed rates since it becomes more expensive to borrow money to make it to the horizon of profitability. So investors might be enticed away from growth stocks and into value stocks and increasingly profitable ""risk-free"" Treasuries.

So the big question is which stocks will be most sensitive to a rising bond market? Are there technical indicators you can use to determine a stock's sensitivity to a rising bond market? High P/E would seem suspect, for example...

The options greek ""Rho"" measures the price change for an option relative to the risk-free rate of interest... Is there something similar for stocks? That would be a freebie.

And of those sensitive-to-rising-bond-market stocks, which ones stand to benefit the least from a booming economy? That gives us our trim list.

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t VIAC have a lot more market share to gain this year with movies coming back to theaters and their business model shifting to more streaming?&lt;/p&gt;

---

I have a friend who pulled his money out of the S&amp;P in 2008 at around the 1000 point market (a 30% loss) to try and buy in lower, and while the market did in fact go lower, he was unable to time the bottom because he waited too long and was too greedy. To this day he still has not bought back in... Not because he thinks the price is going back to 1000, but because he is so bitter that he made this mistake he just cannot bring himself to pay the now 250% - 300% increased price.

At first he waited, then he waited some more and after a few years he lost interest because the price was so much higher than when he sold, especially when the price went past the previous ATH, he completely gave up on the stock market as being a viable investment and instead put his money in a savings account. I've not seen or spoken to him for a few years but I know him, there's no way he would have bought into the market, he was too bitter.


So what's the moral of this story / rant? Don't be like my old friend... Don't try to time the bottom. Don't be greedy. Just accept the discount that's on offer and buy in, then if it drops more, buy some more using your salary. Because if you don't, you're very likely to be stuck in the perpetual cycle of waiting for a correction that you end up inevitably missing the timing anyway.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 8th, 2021.

# **Stocks face the crosscurrents of higher interest rates and fiscal stimulus in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/stocks-face-the-crosscurrents-of-higher-interest-rates-and-fiscal-stimulus-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Covid-19 aid package is on track for final congressional approval in the week ahead — and it could be a double-edged sword for markets.
*****
&gt; The legislation should be greeted by optimism around the powerful lift it could give the stock market and the economy, but it could also be met with concern about what a historically large stimulus package could do to inflation and interest rates.
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 higher, but the Nasdaq was dragged lower by interest rate-sensitive tech names. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has continued to press higher, revisiting its recent high of 1.61% on Friday, before trading at 1.54% in late trading. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; One wild card for stocks could be how interest rates behave around upcoming Treasury auctions.
*****
&gt; There is a $38 billion 10-year auction on Wednesday and a $24 billion 30-year bond auction on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Traders are watching these closely, after a historically weak 7-year Treasury note auction in February sent rates higher, even for the 10-year.
*****
&gt; “We’re a little more cautious on them, just given what we saw in the 7-year and some Japanese selling pressure,” said Ben Jeffery, strategist on the U.S. rates strategy team at BMO Capital Markets.
*****
&gt; He said Japanese institutions could be less interested in participating before the end of their fiscal year on March 31.
*****
&gt; # Stimulus coming
The Senate was expected to approve its version of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package and send it to the House for a vote during the week. Otherwise, the market is watching key inflation reports with the consumer price index expected Wednesday and the producer price index, scheduled for Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think the markets will be watching closely the progress on the stimulus package,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “I think they’ll continue to watch the 10-year Treasury move and we’re going to get CPI data. That’s going to inform on those moves.”
*****
&gt; He expects stimulus to remain a factor that could sway markets.
*****
&gt; Inflation has been a worry for markets, since rising inflation could crush margins and corrode earnings power. For bond investors, it would erode value and make interest payments worth less.
*****
&gt; “As long as the rise in Treasury yields matches the pick-up in inflation, I think the market will be able to handle that. I think the challenge is when yields get notably above inflation...I like to see them closely matched,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; He said the market is concerned that the next stimulus package could overheat the economy and create inflation, particularly as it comes on the heels of the package approved in December.
*****
&gt; “I think it lends to the conversation, ‘do you really need another $1.9 trillion?’ Arone said. “We’re going to pour more gas on the fire, and with this $1.9 trillion that’s what the market is concerned about.”
*****
&gt; Consumer inflation is expected to remain somewhat muted for February, after the 1.4% rise year-over-year in core CPI in January. But the pace of inflation is likely to pick up notably in March and April, since the comparisons to last year, when the economy was shut down, will likely look extreme.
*****
&gt; # Choppy to continue
&gt; Strategists expect the push-pull between interest rates and stocks to continue.
*****
&gt; On Friday, rates were higher after a strong February jobs report and stocks were also higher. The economy added 379,000 jobs in February, about 160,000 more than expected.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think 1.5%, 1.6% on the 10-year is terribly troublesome for the market,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. She said the speed of the move was troubling.
*****
&gt; The rotation out of tech and growth into more cyclical names in the financial, energy and industrial sectors continued in the past week.
*****
&gt; Energy was up more than 10% with oil prices, which were at a near two-year high. Financials saw the next strongest move, gaining 4.3% for the week.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re in a choppy consolidation phase,” said Sonders.
*****
&gt; “You’re seeing some extreme historical spreads between what energy and financials are doing recently versus tech and consumer discretionary,” she said.
*****
&gt; Sonders added that even if the consolidation phase is close to ending, that suggests there could be more downside for some frothy names. “The good news here is I think it’s becoming a better environment for active stock pickers,” she said.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite was down more than 10%, as of Thursday from its Feb. 12 high. But on Friday, the index turned around, gaining about 1.6%. That’s a positive sign for the market, particularly since it happened as rates moved higher.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% for the week, and the Dow was up 1.8%. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was down 2%.
*****
&gt; “I think ultimately the higher quality segments that got hit in tech and communications probably did need to see a valuation reweighting,” Sonders said. “Arguably, we had some micro bubbles in the market, and they may need to suffer more downside.”
*****
&gt; She said investors may want to adjust the allocation of their holdings regularly instead of waiting to adjustments around the calendar
*****
&gt; “If you get a two three week, four five day surge in a particular sector, pare some back,” Sonders said, nothing that’s the opposite of what most people do.

&gt; # Jobs Market Gets Reopening Boost

&gt; US payrolls grew at a solid clip month over month in February, as progress in the vaccine distribution process appeared to boost growth by enabling more of the economy to reopen. Our opinion has always been that until we have achieved widespread vaccine distribution, the in-person segments of the labor market will be slow to recover losses from a year ago. We are becoming increasingly bullish on the prospect for a 2021 economic reacceleration, and we are heartened that the hardest hit segments of the jobs market may be beginning to reflect that view.

&gt; The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added 379,000 jobs in February, exceeding Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ forecasts for a 200,000 gain. Large seasonal adjustments to the data did serve to boost the overall number by roughly 140,000, while January’s jobs gain was revised significantly higher from 49,000 to 166,000. Colder weather than normal may have also played some role, though the worst of the freeze experienced by middle America occurred just after the report’s observation window closed. The unemployment rate fell to 6.2% from 6.3%, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate of 61.4%.

&gt; “Last month on jobs day, we noted our optimism around an improving trajectory for vaccinations and the implications that may have for future jobs reports,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “This has played out so far, and we expect continued vaccination progress to become more evident in the jobs numbers as the recovery reaccelerates.”

&gt; Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% month over month and 5.3% year over year, continuing to signal that lower-wage workers have endured the worst of the pandemic’s job losses. Inflation expectations have been in particular focus for the market lately, however inflation risks from a tightening labor market are not of major concern for now in our opinion. We expect overall average hourly earnings to remain steady or even reverse as lower wage workers are rehired in service sector jobs, and we still have lots of slack in the labor market as we hover well below 2020’s peak employment.

&gt; The composition of February’s report importantly signals a reversal of COVID-19-driven trends seen in recent months. Retail trade gained 41,100 jobs while the leisure and hospitably industry gained 355,000—two segments that have been hardest hit throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, professional and business services added 63,000 jobs and government jobs fell by 86,000.

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the jobs recovery in the leisure and hospitality sector has generally plateaued following an initial bounce. This segment of the labor market is highly dependent on in-person interaction, and has understandably suffered in a work-from-home environment. Unsurprisingly, service sector jobs have strongly correlated with broader trends in COVID-19 cases. The leisure and hospitality sector alone still accounts for about 3.5 million of the 9.5 million jobs lost compared to the February 2020 peak. And while we do caution against reading too far into one month’s numbers, we are excited to see this decimated sector tick notably higher in February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We have not had to look hard to find evidence that vaccines are having an impact. Nationally, seven-day averages for new cases have fallen to below early 2020 peaks, significantly below the highs of late 2020. Perhaps most crucially, the portion of the population most vulnerable to severe symptoms has largely already received at least one dose of the vaccination. A third vaccine was granted emergency use authorization in March, and this week President Biden estimated we would have enough supply of vaccinations to cover every adult by the end of May 2021. Once people can become comfortable with the virus trends, we expect widespread hiring in in-person industries to snowball quickly. February may have signaled a start to this trend.

&gt; # Anatomy of a Bond Market Sell-off

&gt; Coming into 2021, one of our higher-conviction ideas was that we would see rising long-term interest rates in the United States; it’s one of the reasons we recommended suitable investors consider an underweight to interest rate sensitive fixed income. However, we didn’t expect interest rates to move this high, this fast. The 10-Year Treasury yield started the year at 0.91% and ended the month of February at 1.41%, down from an intraday high of 1.61%. As such, core fixed income assets are off to one of their worst starts ever (remember that as yields go up, prices go down).

&gt; “Core fixed income assets aren’t off to a very good start this year, but we don’t think investors should abandon high-quality fixed income assets as they play an important role in a diversified portfolio” says LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; **So what is driving interest rates higher? Changing expectations**

&gt; Inflation and growth expectations are important factors into the fundamental outlook for interest rates. Broadly speaking, what we’ve seen in the bond market this year is a re-pricing of both higher inflation and higher growth expectations. Inflation expectations have steadily moved higher, and market-based gauges of inflation expectations are the highest they’ve been since 2011. We don’t expect much higher inflation expectations from here, but we are watching how additional fiscal stimulus flows into the economy. Additionally, it seems increasing economic growth expectations have picked up recently as well. An increase in growth expectations may put pressure on the Federal Reserve (Fed) to move away from its low interest rate policy sooner than expected, which has put upward pressure on longer-dated Treasury yields.

&gt; An unfortunate byproduct of those higher expectations is that we’ve seen an increase in the volatility of the 10-Year Treasury. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, daily percentage changes for the 10-Year Treasury yield are above historical norms (each vertical line on the chart represents the one day percentage change in the 10-Year Treasury yield). As shown, over the past several months, yields have regularly moved 10-20% in either direction on any given day. We think this is due to the changing interest rate dynamic and believe that interest rate volatility will subside the further we get into this new interest rate regime.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Seasonal Pattern Suggests Weakness Likely Ending Soon

&gt; In the above chart we have plotted five different S&amp;P 500 seasonal patterns along side 2021 through today’s close. “All Years 1949-2020” and “All Years 1988-2020” represent longer-term and mid-term baseline patterns. “All Post-Election Years” includes every year that was a post-presidential-election year regardless of outcome. “1St Year Democratic President” applies to this post-election year and so does “Post-Election Year After Incumbent Party Loss.”

&gt; When comparing 2021 to these various past seasonal patterns, this year’s performance is above average, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently experiencing some of the weakness present in the other five patterns. Historical weakness (shaded in light blue) is most visible in the three post-election year patterns in February lasting until early to mid-March depending on the post-election year pattern. All three historical post-election year patterns suggest that current weakness could be ending soon.

&gt; # Historic Surge for the Energy Sector

&gt; The energy sector has certainly been on a wild ride over the course of the past year, perhaps the wildest of all of the S&amp;P 500 sectors. The outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 caused such a demand shock that oil futures traded for a negative value for the first time in history, implying that someone would pay you to take delivery of their oil!

&gt; Well, that’s in the rear-view mirror for the energy market now. Year to date, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector is up over 29% as of March 2, according to data from FactSet, more than double the return of the financial sector, the second strongest sector thus far in 2021. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector is trading at a blistering 30% above its 200-day moving average, the most ever using data back to 1990. While this might seem bearish on the surface, previous surges above 20% have historically bought above average returns over the next year rather than below average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The case can be made that energy could be a bit stretched in the near-term, but momentum often breeds more momentum,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Energy has been unloved for quite some time, but we may be in the early innings of a larger rally for the energy sector as the global economy continues to improve.”

&gt; A confluence of events may be spurring the boom in the energy sector. An expanding global economy, a historic winter storm that shut down major oil producing states like Texas and Oklahoma, and an output agreement from members of OPEC+ have sent oil prices soaring to their highest level since early 2019. It’s not just oil, either. Copper and lumber have surged past their 2019 highs as well. It’s no secret that inflation expectations have been on the rise, and the surge in commodity prices are likely adding further credence to the market’s view of higher inflation.

&gt; We have continued to warm up to the energy sector, including upgrading our view on oil in January and then our upgrade from negative to neutral in our February Global Portfolio Strategy publication.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 8th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stocks face the crosscurrents of higher interest rates and fiscal stimulus in the week ahead - &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/stocks-face-the-crosscurrents-of-higher-interest-rates-and-fiscal-stimulus-in-the-week-ahead.html""&gt;(Source)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 aid package is on track for final congressional approval in the week ahead — and it could be a double-edged sword for markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislation should be greeted by optimism around the powerful lift it could give the stock market and the economy, but it could also be met with concern about what a historically large stimulus package could do to inflation and interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;amp;P 500 higher, but the Nasdaq was dragged lower by interest rate-sensitive tech names. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has continued to press higher, revisiting its recent high of 1.61% on Friday, before trading at 1.54% in late trading. Yields move opposite price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One wild card for stocks could be how interest rates behave around upcoming Treasury auctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a $38 billion 10-year auction on Wednesday and a $24 billion 30-year bond auction on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traders are watching these closely, after a historically weak 7-year Treasury note auction in February sent rates higher, even for the 10-year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re a little more cautious on them, just given what we saw in the 7-year and some Japanese selling pressure,” said Ben Jeffery, strategist on the U.S. rates strategy team at BMO Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said Japanese institutions could be less interested in participating before the end of their fiscal year on March 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stimulus coming&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate was expected to approve its version of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package and send it to the House for a vote during the week. Otherwise, the market is watching key inflation reports with the consumer price index expected Wednesday and the producer price index, scheduled for Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think the markets will be watching closely the progress on the stimulus package,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “I think they’ll continue to watch the 10-year Treasury move and we’re going to get CPI data. That’s going to inform on those moves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He expects stimulus to remain a factor that could sway markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation has been a worry for markets, since rising inflation could crush margins and corrode earnings power. For bond investors, it would erode value and make interest payments worth less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As long as the rise in Treasury yields matches the pick-up in inflation, I think the market will be able to handle that. I think the challenge is when yields get notably above inflation...I like to see them closely matched,” said Arone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the market is concerned that the next stimulus package could overheat the economy and create inflation, particularly as it comes on the heels of the package approved in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it lends to the conversation, ‘do you really need another $1.9 trillion?’ Arone said. “We’re going to pour more gas on the fire, and with this $1.9 trillion that’s what the market is concerned about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer inflation is expected to remain somewhat muted for February, after the 1.4% rise year-over-year in core CPI in January. But the pace of inflation is likely to pick up notably in March and April, since the comparisons to last year, when the economy was shut down, will likely look extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Choppy to continue&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategists expect the push-pull between interest rates and stocks to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, rates were higher after a strong February jobs report and stocks were also higher. The economy added 379,000 jobs in February, about 160,000 more than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think 1.5%, 1.6% on the 10-year is terribly troublesome for the market,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. She said the speed of the move was troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rotation out of tech and growth into more cyclical names in the financial, energy and industrial sectors continued in the past week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy was up more than 10% with oil prices, which were at a near two-year high. Financials saw the next strongest move, gaining 4.3% for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think we’re in a choppy consolidation phase,” said Sonders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’re seeing some extreme historical spreads between what energy and financials are doing recently versus tech and consumer discretionary,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sonders added that even if the consolidation phase is close to ending, that suggests there could be more downside for some frothy names. “The good news here is I think it’s becoming a better environment for active stock pickers,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Composite was down more than 10%, as of Thursday from its Feb. 12 high. But on Friday, the index turned around, gaining about 1.6%. That’s a positive sign for the market, particularly since it happened as rates moved higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;amp;P 500 was up 0.8% for the week, and the Dow was up 1.8%. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was down 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think ultimately the higher quality segments that got hit in tech and communications probably did need to see a valuation reweighting,” Sonders said. “Arguably, we had some micro bubbles in the market, and they may need to suffer more downside.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said investors may want to adjust the allocation of their holdings regularly instead of waiting to adjustments around the calendar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you get a two three week, four five day surge in a particular sector, pare some back,” Sonders said, nothing that’s the opposite of what most people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jobs Market Gets Reopening Boost&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US payrolls grew at a solid clip month over month in February, as progress in the vaccine distribution process appeared to boost growth by enabling more of the economy to reopen. Our opinion has always been that until we have achieved widespread vaccine distribution, the in-person segments of the labor market will be slow to recover losses from a year ago. We are becoming increasingly bullish on the prospect for a 2021 economic reacceleration, and we are heartened that the hardest hit segments of the jobs market may be beginning to reflect that view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added 379,000 jobs in February, exceeding Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ forecasts for a 200,000 gain. Large seasonal adjustments to the data did serve to boost the overall number by roughly 140,000, while January’s jobs gain was revised significantly higher from 49,000 to 166,000. Colder weather than normal may have also played some role, though the worst of the freeze experienced by middle America occurred just after the report’s observation window closed. The unemployment rate fell to 6.2% from 6.3%, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate of 61.4%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Last month on jobs day, we noted our optimism around an improving trajectory for vaccinations and the implications that may have for future jobs reports,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “This has played out so far, and we expect continued vaccination progress to become more evident in the jobs numbers as the recovery reaccelerates.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% month over month and 5.3% year over year, continuing to signal that lower-wage workers have endured the worst of the pandemic’s job losses. Inflation expectations have been in particular focus for the market lately, however inflation risks from a tightening labor market are not of major concern for now in our opinion. We expect overall average hourly earnings to remain steady or even reverse as lower wage workers are rehired in service sector jobs, and we still have lots of slack in the labor market as we hover well below 2020’s peak employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composition of February’s report importantly signals a reversal of COVID-19-driven trends seen in recent months. Retail trade gained 41,100 jobs while the leisure and hospitably industry gained 355,000—two segments that have been hardest hit throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, professional and business services added 63,000 jobs and government jobs fell by 86,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the jobs recovery in the leisure and hospitality sector has generally plateaued following an initial bounce. This segment of the labor market is highly dependent on in-person interaction, and has understandably suffered in a work-from-home environment. Unsurprisingly, service sector jobs have strongly correlated with broader trends in COVID-19 cases. The leisure and hospitality sector alone still accounts for about 3.5 million of the 9.5 million jobs lost compared to the February 2020 peak. And while we do caution against reading too far into one month’s numbers, we are excited to see this decimated sector tick notably higher in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have not had to look hard to find evidence that vaccines are having an impact. Nationally, seven-day averages for new cases have fallen to below early 2020 peaks, significantly below the highs of late 2020. Perhaps most crucially, the portion of the population most vulnerable to severe symptoms has largely already received at least one dose of the vaccination. A third vaccine was granted emergency use authorization in March, and this week President Biden estimated we would have enough supply of vaccinations to cover every adult by the end of May 2021. Once people can become comfortable with the virus trends, we expect widespread hiring in in-person industries to snowball quickly. February may have signaled a start to this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Anatomy of a Bond Market Sell-off&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming into 2021, one of our higher-conviction ideas was that we would see rising long-term interest rates in the United States; it’s one of the reasons we recommended suitable investors consider an underweight to interest rate sensitive fixed income. However, we didn’t expect interest rates to move this high, this fast. The 10-Year Treasury yield started the year at 0.91% and ended the month of February at 1.41%, down from an intraday high of 1.61%. As such, core fixed income assets are off to one of their worst starts ever (remember that as yields go up, prices go down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Core fixed income assets aren’t off to a very good start this year, but we don’t think investors should abandon high-quality fixed income assets as they play an important role in a diversified portfolio” says LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is driving interest rates higher? Changing expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation and growth expectations are important factors into the fundamental outlook for interest rates. Broadly speaking, what we’ve seen in the bond market this year is a re-pricing of both higher inflation and higher growth expectations. Inflation expectations have steadily moved higher, and market-based gauges of inflation expectations are the highest they’ve been since 2011. We don’t expect much higher inflation expectations from here, but we are watching how additional fiscal stimulus flows into the economy. Additionally, it seems increasing economic growth expectations have picked up recently as well. An increase in growth expectations may put pressure on the Federal Reserve (Fed) to move away from its low interest rate policy sooner than expected, which has put upward pressure on longer-dated Treasury yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unfortunate byproduct of those higher expectations is that we’ve seen an increase in the volatility of the 10-Year Treasury. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, daily percentage changes for the 10-Year Treasury yield are above historical norms (each vertical line on the chart represents the one day percentage change in the 10-Year Treasury yield). As shown, over the past several months, yields have regularly moved 10-20% in either direction on any given day. We think this is due to the changing interest rate dynamic and believe that interest rate volatility will subside the further we get into this new interest rate regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Seasonal Pattern Suggests Weakness Likely Ending Soon&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above chart we have plotted five different S&amp;amp;P 500 seasonal patterns along side 2021 through today’s close. “All Years 1949-2020” and “All Years 1988-2020” represent longer-term and mid-term baseline patterns. “All Post-Election Years” includes every year that was a post-presidential-election year regardless of outcome. “1St Year Democratic President” applies to this post-election year and so does “Post-Election Year After Incumbent Party Loss.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When comparing 2021 to these various past seasonal patterns, this year’s performance is above average, and the S&amp;amp;P 500 is currently experiencing some of the weakness present in the other five patterns. Historical weakness (shaded in light blue) is most visible in the three post-election year patterns in February lasting until early to mid-March depending on the post-election year pattern. All three historical post-election year patterns suggest that current weakness could be ending soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Historic Surge for the Energy Sector&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy sector has certainly been on a wild ride over the course of the past year, perhaps the wildest of all of the S&amp;amp;P 500 sectors. The outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 caused such a demand shock that oil futures traded for a negative value for the first time in history, implying that someone would pay you to take delivery of their oil!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s in the rear-view mirror for the energy market now. Year to date, the S&amp;amp;P 500 energy sector is up over 29% as of March 2, according to data from FactSet, more than double the return of the financial sector, the second strongest sector thus far in 2021. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;amp;P 500 energy sector is trading at a blistering 30% above its 200-day moving average, the most ever using data back to 1990. While this might seem bearish on the surface, previous surges above 20% have historically bought above average returns over the next year rather than below average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(&lt;a href=""https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1""&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The case can be made that energy could be a bit stretched in the near-term, but momentum often breeds more momentum,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Energy has been unloved for quite some time, but we may be in the early innings of a larger rally for the energy sector as the global economy continues to improve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A confluence of events may be spurring the boom in the energy sector. An expanding global economy, a historic winter storm that shut down major oil producing states like Texas and Oklahoma, and an output agreement from members of OPEC+ have sent oil prices soaring to their highest level since early 2019. It’s not just oil, either. Copper and lumber have surged past their 2019 highs as well. It’s no secret that inflation expectations have been on the rise, and the surge in commodity prices are likely adding further credence to the market’s view of higher inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have continued to warm up to the energy sector, including upgrading our view on oil in January and then our upgrade from negative to neutral in our February Global Portfolio Strategy publication.&lt;/p&gt;

Six years later, Musk’s SpaceX launched the world’s most powerful rocket, the Falcon Heavy. That milestone marked another first, since the Falcon carried the Tesla Roadster into space, making the pioneering EV the first auto ever to orbit the Earth.

Recently, Musk has set supersonic financial records. Tesla’s moonshot from a market cap of $30 billion in mid-April of last year to $849 billion on Jan. 26 dwarfs the leap of any other young comer on the rise in a nine-month span. By early January, Tesla’s rise had lifted Musk’s net worth to $185 billion, placing the Tesla founder on a new pedestal as the world’s richest person.

Musk just achieved a new financial first––for the stock losing the most value ever in a brief period. Since that late January peak, Tesla’s valuation has cratered by 36%, dropping by $305 billion to $544 billion at mid-morning on March 5, as its shares tumbled from $883 to $566. No company in the annals of equity markets has ever dropped on a scale remotely that big in just five and a half weeks. Tesla’s $300 billion–plus descent exceeds the market caps of all but the 16 most valuable companies in the S&amp;P 500. Tesla dropped by far more than twice the combined market caps of Ford and General Motors, and by $100 billion more than that of the world’s second most valuable automaker, Toyota.

It may reassure Tesla bulls that it’s been a highly volatile stock in the past: It has seen big drops and then always recovered to shoot beyond previous peaks. From mid-February to mid-March of last year, it shed half its value and in the first two weeks of September, fell 34%, only to roar back on both occasions. The September slump shaved $186 billion from its valuation, but Tesla got it all back, and $400 billion more in the months ahead. Sure, you’ll hear, Tesla will suffer big bumps along the way, but its long-term trajectory will trace a sharp upward climb.
Still, the 34% decline means that Tesla’s shares need to rebound 56% to regain their old peak of $883 (and valuation of $849 billion). Overnight, investors decided that Tesla will earn a lot less than they foresaw as recently as late January.

What’s driving Tesla’s big pullback?

Let’s assume shareholders will want at least a 10% annual return in exchange for what can be counted on as a wild ride. To get there as of late January, Tesla needed to be worth $2.2 trillion by early 2031. At a premium price-to-earnings multiple of 30, Tesla would be generating $73 billion in yearly GAAP net earnings. That’s $5 billion more than Apple, by far the biggest profit spinner in the S&amp;P, made last year.

Now, shareholders have lowered the bar––but that bar remains dauntingly high. Using the same formula, the bogey is now $1.44 trillion 10 years from now, and earnings would need to reach $48 billion. To get there, Tesla’s 2020 profits of $721 million have to grow at an annual pace of around 50%.
That Tesla suffered such a huge fall, so fast, highlights the extreme uncertainty in assessing what it’s really worth. In reality, investors have little or no idea how much Tesla will earn in the future. Will the number be $60 billion in 2031 or $10 billion, something lower than that or something in between? Making any reasonable estimate requires so many assumptions that the exercise is futile. What remains is a super-sexy product, a charismatic CEO, a cult following, and a great narrative. What also remains is a still-giant valuation that can only go higher if great numbers start coming in, and fast. Otherwise, Tesla is sitting on an air pocket whose deflation would set new records unlikely ever to be equaled.""

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

&lt;p&gt;The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;priced in&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security&amp;#39;s price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

,stocks,"The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday set a reference price of $45 for shares of U.S. gaming platform Roblox Corp on the eve of its public market debut, implying a market value for the company of around $30 billion. San Mateo, California-based Roblox is among the world's most popular gaming sites for children and offers a host of games across mobile devices and gaming consoles. The reference price is not an offering price to purchase shares but rather will be a performance benchmark for when Roblox's stock starts trading on the stock exchange on Wednesday. The opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers. Roblox has opted to go public through a direct listing rather than a traditional initial public offering (IPO). This means the company is not selling any shares in advance of its market debut, as is the case with IPOs. Direct listings are still relatively rare, though they are becoming increasingly popular way to go public amid criticism that investment banks underwriting IPOs underprice shares being sold to help create a first-day trading ""pop"" for the benefit of their big trading clients. Reuters reported last week that U.S. grocery delivery app Instacart is considering going public through a direct listing, concerned that it could leave money on the table through an IPO. Roblox said in January it had raised around $520 million in a new Series H private fundraising round in a deal which valued it at $29.5 billion, more than seven times the $4 billion the company was valued at in its Series G round 11 months earlier. U.S. demand for video games has surged as consumers seek home entertainment while living under lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. - Reuters

There are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** u/bEAc0n) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

&gt;**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**

Edit: apparently people cant bother to even type ""Cede and co"" into the internet. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede\_and\_Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cede_and_Company)

,stocks,"After a steep pullback in the last couple of weeks, stocks roared back Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq recording its best day since April 2020. The move marked a stark reversal after the index sank into a correction by the close of Monday's session, plunging a total of more than 10% from a recent record closing high. Goes to show how volatile the market can be. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.42% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.10% up.

The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. 

The Treasury yield pulled back a little but remains at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. . Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Courtney Dominguez, Payne Capital Management Senior Wealth Advisor said, “This is a trend that tends to happen as we get out of a recession: You tend to see stocks move towards cyclical. So things like value companies or small caps, things like energy, tend to do really well when you’re coming out of a recession. And what happened last year is, those tech companies were really doing so well that their prices were getting extremely high. I don’t think these companies are going away. I think a lot of these are going to be things that we continue to have in our workplaces going forward. But the question is, are these companies so expensive, is all the optimism already priced in?”

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire.

,stocks," As everyone is well aware, the market has been a wild ride for the past couple weeks, with tech being crushed while ""re-opening"" and other value plays like energy have mostly performed well. We've seen big moves out of the airlines and cruise companies, but I personally feel that Coca-Cola is a stronger re-opening play than either of those.

KO is trading at just under $51 as of today's close, down from its pre-COVID high of $60 last year. The company was hit hard by their consumers being stuck at home for months, unable to dine out and attend sporting events or concerts. Revenue and earnings were down in 2020, and even with vaccines coming out it may still be a while until they return to 2019 levels.

With that being said, Coca-Cola took steps to re-organize their business to become more efficient in order to respond to the pandemic. I think that they can emerge from the pandemic as a more focused business, and once top-line revenues catch back up the company could really see some improvements in their earnings.

Their CEO touched on some of these aspects in their earnings call back in February:

Even with the headwinds they faced in the past year, KO still managed to increase their annual dividend to $1.64, their 39th consecutive annual increase. Of all of the so-called ""reopening plays,"" I feel like KO has not had a huge bounce due to changing investor sentiment. For example, cruise lines like Carnival are issuing new shares just to stay afloat (literally), and are months away from even being able to receive passengers. Yet investors have already pumped their shares 30% in the past month. I understand that KO is only 16% below their pre-COVID high so I'm not expecting a 25% run up out of them in the next month or anything. I'm just surprised that more people don't seem to be getting behind this name. With restrictions being lifted across the country, the amount of Coke products that will be bought at convenience stores, restaurants, and arenas will start to pick up. There's a pent-up demand for people to get out of the house, but not everyone is financially able to book a cruise or plane ticket right now. However, almost anyone can celebrate by taking their family to the local pizzeria or taco place and washing their meal down with a Coke or Sprite. There are hundreds of restaurants in NYC alone that will be increasing their orders for both flavor syrup and bottled drinks now that indoor dining is returning.

With that being said, my plan at the moment is to use a small portion of my portfolio (\~10%) to scoop some shares on the next drop to $50 or below. This would be at least a year hold, to collect the dividend income along with hopefully $5-10 in gains per share. About 70% of my portfolio is loaded to the tits with PLTR (300 @ 32 lol), IPOE, PSTH, and some biotech, so on the recent dip I've been thinking about adding some value plays like KO or COST.

I decided to post a Discussion here rather than go the DD route because I'm not 100% sold on this play myself. If you have any opinions about KO (good or bad) please share! I'm obviously not worried that the stock is gonna tank 50% or anything, but my main fear is that it could trade sideways between $48 and $52 for the next 6 months, and if tech finds some more room to run I'd hate to miss out on those gains.

Is KO a good re-opening play? Are there better value plays out there rn? Can tech keep running after this correction? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Yet investors have already pumped their shares 30% in the past month. I understand that KO is only 16% below their pre-COVID high so I&amp;#39;m not expecting a 25% run up out of them in the next month or anything. I&amp;#39;m just surprised that more people don&amp;#39;t seem to be getting behind this name. With restrictions being lifted across the country, the amount of Coke products that will be bought at convenience stores, restaurants, and arenas will start to pick up. There&amp;#39;s a pent-up demand for people to get out of the house, but not everyone is financially able to book a cruise or plane ticket right now. However, almost anyone can celebrate by taking their family to the local pizzeria or taco place and washing their meal down with a Coke or Sprite. There are hundreds of restaurants in NYC alone that will be increasing their orders for both flavor syrup and bottled drinks now that indoor dining is returning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, my plan at the moment is to use a small portion of my portfolio (~10%) to scoop some shares on the next drop to $50 or below. This would be at least a year hold, to collect the dividend income along with hopefully $5-10 in gains per share. About 70% of my portfolio is loaded to the tits with PLTR (300 @ 32 lol), IPOE, PSTH, and some biotech, so on the recent dip I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about adding some value plays like KO or COST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to post a Discussion here rather than go the DD route because I&amp;#39;m not 100% sold on this play myself. If you have any opinions about KO (good or bad) please share! I&amp;#39;m obviously not worried that the stock is gonna tank 50% or anything, but my main fear is that it could trade sideways between $48 and $52 for the next 6 months, and if tech finds some more room to run I&amp;#39;d hate to miss out on those gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is KO a good re-opening play? Are there better value plays out there rn? Can tech keep running after this correction? I&amp;#39;d love to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not financial advice and I have no shares of KO at the present time.&lt;/p&gt;

Second time posting DD ($ON was my first [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lh6ppx/on_on_semiconductor_analysis/))- please do provide constructive feedback on what other areas you would have looked into / found useful and overall formatting. Additionally, if you have arrived at different conclusions / can poke holes in the theory I look forward to reading rebuttals in the comments. There was a lot more research that went into this one as some of the kind commenters identified gaps in my research methodology last time so I have tried to make up for it here.

All currency in USD and Millions unless otherwise specified.

### TL; DR

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.
Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.

2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with

3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.

4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. 

2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.

3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).

4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY. 


Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.

### Key Data

All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021

- Price = $13.45
- P/E = -12x
- EPS = -2.12 (dil)
- Forward P/E = 8.5x


# Detailed Analysis

### Bull Considerations

- $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.

- $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).

- Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes^(1) and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).

- The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of &gt; 9%).

- Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.

- Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.


### Bear Considerations

- Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.

- $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.

- $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)

- $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.

- Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.

- Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.

- Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.


### Neutral Considerations

- Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.

- Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.

- Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date^(2). Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (&lt; 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement^(3). I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.

- $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.


### Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.
  - Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025^(4).
  - Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth^(5).
  - Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026^(6).
  - Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

2. Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).
  - VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025^(7). Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
  - Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027^(8). The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres^(9).
  - Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
  - Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027^(10). However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

3. Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.
  - The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022^(11).
  - The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026^(12).
  - The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025^(13). While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

4. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. 
  - Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025^(14). However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%^(15).

5. Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.
  - The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%^(16).
  - Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually^(17).
  - Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021^(18)). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR^(19).
  - Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025^(20).

### Competitive Advantage

1. Adaptive Networking:
 - Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
 - From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&amp;T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either^(21, 22). N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
 - $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route^(23).
 - The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
 - While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&amp;T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

2. Collaboration:
 - Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
 - While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
 - Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

3. Connected Security:
 - Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
 - If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
 - Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

4. Edge Computing:
 - Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
 - As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with &lt;5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
 - An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
 - While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

5. Hybrid Cloud: 
 - Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
 - Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively^(24).
 - If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

&lt;h3&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.
Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do have a read of the Bull, Bear and Neutral points in the detailed post below for a more balanced and in-depth view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All data believed to be accurate as of 05/03/2021&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price = $13.45&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/E = -12x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPS = -2.12 (dil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward P/E = 8.5x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Detailed Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bull Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of &amp;gt; 9%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bear Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Neutral Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (&amp;lt; 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Organisation Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;. While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;. However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Competitive Advantage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptive Networking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either&lt;sup&gt;21, 22&lt;/sup&gt;. N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connected Security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edge Computing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with &amp;lt;5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Cloud: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

,stocks,"iStar (STAR) is a REIT in transition moving assets to their ground leasing company called SAFE. There is a massive mispricing between the two intertwined companies.  **iStar's market cap is $1.3B yet owns $2.5B worth of SAFE** *and* **$3.1B worth of assets yielding 7.9%.** As of Q4, there was only $50M of non-performing assets. This is trading at nearly an 80% discount!

# iStar’s SAFE investment ($2.5B):

iStar created the ground leasing company SAFE in 2017,  which is a REIT that owns ground leases, not buildings.  There is already a lot written about SAFE, so I'm not going to summarize that; instead I'll focus on the mispricing. iStar owns 34.8M shares of SAFE currently valued at $2.5B ($73 / share)( [Slide 11](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008) ). Based solely on iStars SAFE holding, **iStar should trade at $34.25 a share**($2.5B of SAFE/ 74M iStar shares outstanding).

Is SAFE legit? Goldman thinks so with a recently initiated $101 price target (Jan 2021), with a street average of $90 a share. If SAFE reached Goldman’s PT, this would translate to an iStar holding of $3.5B in SAFE. Based on **Goldman’s SAFE Price target**, **iStar should trade at $47.10** a share, some 268% where it trades now.

At this point, the mispricing is so stark that **if you bought $73 of iStar** (i.e. 1 share of SAFE), you would get ***1.93 shares of SAFE***\*, plus iStar’s other underlying assets worth some $3B.\*

# iStar’s Other Assets($3.1B):

iStar breaks out their other lines of business into three buckets:

* Net Lease Consolidated Assets: $2.162B yielding 7.9% ([Slide 12](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Net Lease Venture II: 300M yielding 9% ([Slide 13](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report)
* Real Estate Finance Portfolio: $646M at 7.2% ([Slide 15](https://ir.istar.com/static-files/51ee150a-702f-4c96-858d-21667ff53008), Q4 report).

In total, they have only $52M of non-performing assets.  These assets total **$3.1B yielding 7.9%.**

# Upcoming catalysts:

I strongly feel it's a matter of time before the market realizes this massive price discrepancy. Here are some possible events:

* Goldman initiated coverage on SAFE on January 27th, 2021. Why not cover iStar if they own 63% of SAFE?
* Three major assets of iStar are Asbury Park, Magnolia Green and Grand Vista. They are looking sell these off over the next 2 years. This would be a massive cash event that could trigger a large iStar share repurchase program.
* iStar has been trying to simplify its message by selling off legacy (though high quality) assets. iStar is nearly complete with this process and plans to begin messaging this year
* SAFE x STAR One-Stop Capital Program was launched in Q4. This combines deals that allow companies to ground lease through SAFE, then allow iStar to offer financing. This could offer some additonal topline growth and further prove their business model is scalable and synergistic between iStar and SAFE going forward.

I wanna start by saying kudos to everyone who's holding their stocks!  
Been rough few months but let's all hope that the market comes back sooner than later.

Moving onto my question.... On top of my current portfolio, I've been holding cash aside for a while and I decided to put in another $10K into the market. I'm thinking to put it all into either DIS or AAPL to maximize the gain. I'm looking medium to long term, and I can wear through storms like this one or the COVID crash back in March 2020 as I don't need this cash any time soon. Since my portfolio is already tech heavy, I think DIS makes more sense but I wanted to run it through this sub and pick on your brains. 

Please feel free to share your thoughts! also on my portfolio as well. I won't take any of your inputs as financial advises and will make my own judgements. Thanks so much in advance.

So Fool is running around touting ""640x returns"" based on an ""inflection in the market"", mostly based it seems about an upcoming Tesla announcement on self-driving, plus a bunch of really forward looking stuff. Of course, all this is for $999 and so on.  

I've taken a look at some stocks but I'm not up on the space. On the LIDAR side there's Luminar Technologies (LAZR) seems to be the darling with Velodyne Lidar (VLDR) coming up. There's also Innoviz (CGRO now, INVZ soon), AEye (via CFAC acquisition), ditto Ouster (via CLA).  
The press seems to be that the market is a little crowded and there needs to be a shakeup. I'm guessing Fool will either go with LAZR (because cool) or VLDR (as an up-and-comer)
     
Other possible mentions seem to be STMicroelectronics (STM)

That's as far as I've gone for now, but Fool is pushing this for an event in around 10 days so now would be a good time to get in ahead of the inevitable upswing with Fool subs jumping in.

,stocks,"TACO Earning Report released yesterday afternoon!

Put on your seatbelt and get ready for a very interesting Company Analysis on $TACO!!!

Del Taco Restaurants Inc. is an American fast-food restaurant chain that specializes in American-style Mexican cuisine as well as American foods such as tacos, burritos, fries, nachos, and shakes.

Why was Del Taco’s earning report awesome? Because the C-Suite bought back a bunch of their shares last quarter! Not to mention the C-Suite has not sold a share for over two years! These factors combined with Del Taco serving boatloads of Tacos to increasing their 2020 revenues to match their 2019 revenue levels with fewer stores opened during the pandemic!

With the $1.9 trillion relief package on the horizon and potential talks about marijuana legalization, we may be seeing a demand increase for Fast Food!

Here are the Bull case highlights from yesterdays Earning Report on TACO:

1. Earning report had an **EPS smashing analysts’ estimates by 6 cents** on a per-share basis!!!
2. Only 5.9 million shares of TACO sauce available for General Public purchase. The company repurchased 496,356 shares last quarter! **Low available shares!**
3. Fintel shows Insider ownership of 56.22% with no one selling in the past two years! C-Suite has the biggest Dimond Hands ever!!!
4. 14% short interest reported on earnings day and I predict the shorts will cover out of their positions in the next day or two as the stock is breaking their resistance levels and at its ATH price.

Now for the reason why this has a bullish future!!!

1. Based on the earning report Franchised comparable restaurant sales increased 7.5%! The company is looking to pivot with more franchisees as they bring in the revenue!
2. Del Taco is offering a new “Fresh Flex” Store design recently announced to new franchise owners. Double drive-through lanes, delivery pick-up stations, and dedicated parking lot areas for those who want to park, eat tacos, and go!
3. Del Taco is expanding into Columbus Ohio! Market exposure into Columbus = an increase in their Stores to break 600 store locations this year!
4. Analyst shows a strong buy with a price target of $12.5 on average and $15 high. Currently, there is a **low resistance barrier at $11.71** which should be passed this week!

Bear case

1. The CEO John Cappasola hasn't been very active on PR and has no Twitter to push PR out.
2. There is a low volume on the stocks and the stock has been prone to HF Shorting the stock.

TLDR: Del Taco will be increasing market shares throughout the U.S. starting this year with a new Franchise (Fresh Flex) rollout which will pivot the company and capture more market shares! This is stable stock during times of uncertainty as shown in their 2020 revenue and has a good growth projection!. Great stock to own!

This is not financial advice. I love Tacos, I love the Stock, and I believe TACO stock is extremely undervalued!

Position 75 12.5C Mar 19th (If the stock price increases quickly I will probably sell early near the 25% profit.

,stocks,"Hi all. I have seen some great posts here and I wanted to share some due diligence I have done over the last 24 hours on Avangrid, Inc. (AVG), which I think is poised for a move upward. This is just my personal musing and should not be interpreted, taken, or inferred as financial advice. Full disclosure: I own two March 19, 2021 50 calls and I am considering purchasing shares and more calls.

TL;DR - AGR is one of the larger energy companies in the US, recently received a long awaited environmental impact statement from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (""BOEM"") as to its massive offshore wind farm, and appears to have support of the Biden administration. The company and its stock could be poised for growth and upward movement.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I first learned of this company yesterday while researching the Biden administration's timeline for green energy projects. While doing said research, I came across press releases and news on AGR. The BOEM has finally released the environmental impact statements as to the Vineyard Wind 1 project. It seems that it was being held up by the Trump administration for political reasons. Here is some information from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005701/en/AVANGRID-Offshore-Wind-Joint-Venture-Vineyard-Wind-1-Achieves-Key-Regulatory-Milestone):

&gt; ""AVANGRID, Inc. (NYSE: AGR) confirmed today that the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has issued the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Vineyard Wind 1. The issuance of the FEIS is the final step before a Record of Decision (ROD) from BOEM, the last approval required for construction on the project to begin. The project is under development by Vineyard Wind, a joint venture between Avangrid Renewables, a subsidiary of AVANGRID, Inc., and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP).""  
&gt;  
&gt;""With the issuance of the FEIS, Vineyard Wind confirmed that the project remains on track to reach financial close in the second half of 2021 and begin delivering clean energy to Massachusetts in 2023.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Located 15 miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, Vineyard Wind 1 is slated to become the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the United States. With a generating capacity of 800 megawatts (MW), the project will provide enough electricity to power more than 400,000 homes and businesses in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts...""

It seems like AGR has plans to build other offshore wind farms:

&gt;""In addition to Vineyard Wind 1, Avangrid Renewables is a partner on Park City Wind, an 800 MW project to serve the state of Connecticut, as well as on additional lease areas off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island to deliver up to 3,500 MW. Avangrid Renewables also is developing Kitty Hawk Offshore Wind that has the potential to deliver 2,500 MW of clean energy into Virginia and North Carolina.""

There is also AGR's acquisition of PNM. AGR has recently been [moving to purchase](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210212005493/en/PNM-Resources-Shareholders-Approve-Proposed-AVANGRID-Merger) a large energy producer in New Mexico. I will not hazard a guess as to how this will affects the share price, but according to the above article:

&gt;""AVANGRID announced the strategic PNM Resources merger combination in October 2020 in an all cash offer for PNM Resources’ shares at $50.30 per share, an $8.3 billion enterprise value transaction. The resulting entity would be one of the major clean energy companies in the US with ten regulated utilities in six states and the third largest renewables company with operations in 24 states.  
&gt;  
&gt;'Approval by PNM’s shareholders is an important step toward realizing this strategic transaction. Our two companies share the same values and we are passionate about our customers, employees, and the communities we serve,' said Dennis V. Arriola, CEO of AVANGRID.""

Some of the financial data I pulled from Nasdaq today:

\*\*P/E Ratio\*\*25.7

\*\*Forward P/E 1 Yr.\*\*21.33

\*\*Earnings Per Share(EPS)\*\*$1.88

\*\*Annualized Dividend\*\*$1.76

Thus, unlike a lot of typical green energy growth stock, AGR is already profitable and pays a dividend.

According the head of the National Ocean Industries Association President quoted in this [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/03/08/biden-climate-windfarm/), it seems like offshore wind could end up being a huge area, with the potential for $160 billion worth of investments over the next fifteen years:

&gt;""Monday’s announcement drew praise from industry. National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito said it was “critical for the project developers and for the offshore wind industry as a whole.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Milito called on the administration to move even faster, noting that it has been two years since the last federal offshore wind lease sale. He noted that a recent analysis suggested near-term lease opportunities could generate more than $160 billion in new investment over the next 15 years, but that Interior’s Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management “must first open the door to new leasing.”

I like the dividend, the potential for growth, and the alignment with the current political climate. I am mulling whether to buy shares in addition to trading the options. The one concern for me as a long-term investment, however, is that the P/E ratio is still a little high for my taste. I generally avoid ""growth stocks"" in my investment portfolio. I am on the fence.

Canoo’s last S-1 was filed almost two months ago, but I hadn’t read it until tonight. I did read the one available in August, and shared [my research](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/j6u367/canoo_is_on_to_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) in October.

After wrapping my mind around the subtle, positive changes in messaging in their latest filing, and the [impending premiere of Canoo's newest vehicle](https://www.reddit.com/r/goev/comments/m0og3t/canoogoev_pickup_truck_world_premiere_march_11th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I'm considering what may be the most interesting question the company has forced us to ponder in months:

When did the pick-up truck become the next thing?

We’ve seen it in a few renderings, and [Tony mentioned it was coming back in December](https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-electric-canoo/canoo-reveals-electric-delivery-van-plans-for-pickup-microfactories-idUSKBN28R21Q), but it hasn’t ever been included on their roll-out schedule.

That order has always been:

* Consumer Van (short-term lease/subscription, 2022)
* B2B/MPDV (sales, 2023)
* Sedan (short-term lease/subscription, 2024 or 25)

And that’s how it was reflected [in the company’s latest prospectus](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-001996/fs12021_canooinc.htm), which was published in early January. It discusses (as it did in August), the three offerings listed above in meaningful detail, but never mentions the truck. [It wasn’t discussed in the investor presentation either](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_75917b64e8f13bc03dbc9e3230eeade6/canoo/db/1087/9680/pdf/HCAC+Canoo+-+Investor+Presentation+-+FINAL.pdf).

Which made me wonder:

* Why is the truck being revealed before the sedan?
* Is it going to be *released* before the sedan?
* If so, why the change? Was it due to a commercial order?
* Or is it simply because they believe they’ll move more units across segments with two vans (B2C and MPVD) and a truck than they could with a sedan in it’s place?

The reality is, we won’t know the answer to any of those questions until the event wraps up on Thursday (at the earliest), but it's fun to think about, and based on the conclusions I'm drawing while going through this exercise, I suspect we’ll end up appreciating at least a few of the answers that eventually come our way.

———

Here are a few quotes from the S-1 that add credibility to the notion that this truck roll-out could be the result of a pressing market opportunity that Canoo recently decided to take advantage of:

“We are actively exploring \[new\] market opportunities and will continue to carefully assess and pursue \[them\] as they become available.”

and

“In addition to this current planned vehicle lineup, we have evaluated and continue to evaluate the consumer and commercial vehicle markets, including projected trends and developments, to identify new areas of demand and product opportunities. Our skateboard platform uniquely positions us to efficiently allocate capital to meet current and evolving demand and margin opportunities by allowing us to quickly adjust volumes and add new product derivatives.”

———

And here are a handful of statements from the latest S-1, that produce questions we're all looking forward to gaining answers to:

* “We are \[currently\] in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging our technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.” Who?
* “We are in advanced discussions with several parties regarding the licensing of our skateboard and other technology.” Who and what other technology?
* “Our skateboard platform and our steer-by-wire and centralized computing architecture make us uniquely positioned to take advantage of continuing advancements in autonomous vehicle technology. We are in discussions with some of the most prominent companies pursuing this technology.” Who?
* “We are also in discussions with a number of other partners and expect to be in a position to announce many more partnerships in due course.” Who and when?
* “We and a potential contract manufacturing partner have been working together on vehicle designs for manufacturability and production planning since early 2018.” Still focused on contract manufacturing in most current S-1, but Tony mentioned micro-factories in December.

&lt;li&gt;Sedan (short-term lease/subscription, 2024 or 25)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s how it was reflected &lt;a href=""https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-001996/fs12021_canooinc.htm""&gt;in the company’s latest prospectus&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in early January. It discusses (as it did in August), the three offerings listed above in meaningful detail, but never mentions the truck. &lt;a href=""https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_75917b64e8f13bc03dbc9e3230eeade6/canoo/db/1087/9680/pdf/HCAC+Canoo+-+Investor+Presentation+-+FINAL.pdf""&gt;It wasn’t discussed in the investor presentation either&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which made me wonder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is the truck being revealed before the sedan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it going to be &lt;em&gt;released&lt;/em&gt; before the sedan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If so, why the change? Was it due to a commercial order?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or is it simply because they believe they’ll move more units across segments with two vans (B2C and MPVD) and a truck than they could with a sedan in it’s place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is, we won’t know the answer to any of those questions until the event wraps up on Thursday (at the earliest), but it&amp;#39;s fun to think about, and based on the conclusions I&amp;#39;m drawing while going through this exercise, I suspect we’ll end up appreciating at least a few of the answers that eventually come our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;———&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few quotes from the S-1 that add credibility to the notion that this truck roll-out could be the result of a pressing market opportunity that Canoo recently decided to take advantage of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are actively exploring [new] market opportunities and will continue to carefully assess and pursue [them] as they become available.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In addition to this current planned vehicle lineup, we have evaluated and continue to evaluate the consumer and commercial vehicle markets, including projected trends and developments, to identify new areas of demand and product opportunities. Our skateboard platform uniquely positions us to efficiently allocate capital to meet current and evolving demand and margin opportunities by allowing us to quickly adjust volumes and add new product derivatives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;———&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are a handful of statements from the latest S-1, that produce questions we&amp;#39;re all looking forward to gaining answers to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We are [currently] in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging our technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.” Who?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We are in advanced discussions with several parties regarding the licensing of our skateboard and other technology.” Who and what other technology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Our skateboard platform and our steer-by-wire and centralized computing architecture make us uniquely positioned to take advantage of continuing advancements in autonomous vehicle technology. We are in discussions with some of the most prominent companies pursuing this technology.” Who?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We are also in discussions with a number of other partners and expect to be in a position to announce many more partnerships in due course.” Who and when?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We and a potential contract manufacturing partner have been working together on vehicle designs for manufacturability and production planning since early 2018.” Still focused on contract manufacturing in most current S-1, but Tony mentioned micro-factories in December. How do they plan to scale production?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

,stocks,"I've been seeing conflicting descriptions of what happens with wash sales recently and thought it would be good for this community to clarify what happens in different situations.

It seems like everyone understands that if you buy a stock 30 days after selling for a loss, that loss isn't deductible. However, there seems to be confusion over the tax implications of subsequent actions. 

Let's say you originally buy 100 shares of a stock at $100. You then sell those shares at $80, for a $2000 loss. If you rebuy within 30 days, I think most people understand that the $2000 loss is not deductible and instead gets added to your cost basis.

Let's say you rebuy 100 shares within 30 days at a price of $70. Your cost basis should now be $7000 + $2000 = $9000.

Now, let's say the stock drops again and you sell at $60. This is where there seems to be confusion about what is deductible.

My understanding is that the new loss would be $6000 - $9000 = $3000, due to the increased cost basis. 

***QUESTION 1***: Is this $3000 loss is deductible, despite the original wash sale? 

I've been assuming yes, but I see a lot of people that suggest it isn't deductible. Is it correct that deductible losses are always determined from the cost basis at the most recent sale (ignoring long-term vs short-term issues)? I keep seeing people say that the deduction cannot include losses from previous wash sales, but if that is true, why would the wash sale increase the cost basis? I thought that was the point of the increased cost basis.

There are horror stories of people making $200k in taxable gains that they lost entirely through wash sales, making them owe taxes on the $200k despite losing it all. Couldn't that only occur if a wash sale occurred within 30 days of a new year, or if they never closed their position after a wash sale? As long as you sold before the new year and didn't rebuy, this couldn't happen, could it?

***QUESTION 2:*** Is a wash sale a reason to never rebuy a stock within 30 days?

I've frequently see people say ""I sold at a loss, so I have to wait 30 days to buy back in otherwise I can't deduct the loss."" Isn't this true only if they don't resell that same year, or if they create another wash sale in January? Basically, I'm seeing people wait to get back in on a rising stock simply because it is within 30 days. If you want to be be able to deduct the current loss within this tax year, then sure, that makes sense to wait. However, if you don't mind risking pushing that deduction to a later time, doesn't it make much more sense to buy back in if you think the stock will continue rising? I'm basically seeing people deciding to not rebuy a stock because they are afraid they won't ever be able to deduct a loss.

**QUESTION 3:** Ignoring long-term vs short-term gains/losses, can't you always *eventually* deduct an equivalent amount regardless of wash sales? 

Basically, because the cost basis gets adjusted with wash sales, aren't those losses always included when you close your position, either resulting in decreased profits, or increased losses. If so, is there anything critical missing in the suggestion: ""don't rebuy within 30 days if you want to deduct the loss within the current year.""

They haven't had much revenue growth the past years, but I expect that to change being at the beginning of a new console cycle. They are killing earnings and you can't even find the PS5 in store.

So long story short, with it currently sitting pretty at $40, I find it a really attractive buy, especially given the fact that it's been close to $100 (high of $94.81). The catch is, I wanna sell my position in Twilio to fund the purchase of a butt ton $NNOX. The twilio value is double the initial investment.

My logic is, $NNOX will at least double at some point in the coming 2-3 months with FDA clearance. Therefore, I can potentially buy back into Twilio at an equal or greater amount and then use whatever I have left elsewhere.

**Apple Inc’s** [AAPL 3.53%](https://benzinga.com/stock/aapl#NASDAQ) smartphones are set to get camera upgrades in 2022 and 2023 that will make them more robust and increase their shooting capability, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, AppleInsider [reported](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/09/kuo-unibody-lens-coming-to-iphone-in-2022-periscope-lens-in-2023) Tuesday.

**What Happened:** The iPhone will come with a “unibody” design in 2022 which will integrate the voice coil motor of its camera and the lens array, according to Kuo.

This move could free up internal space in the device and increase the robustness of the smartphone made by the Tim Cook-led company, according to AppleInsider.

Apple plans to add a telephoto camera on its high-end iPhones from a 6P lens array to a 7P stack in 2022 as well. 

The Cupertino, California-based tech giant is reportedly planning to move all its rear-facing iPhone lenses to the 7P stack in the coming years. 

The analyst said that, in 2023, Apple will introduce a telephoto lens design to the iPhone. This type of design helps to extend the focal length of a compact lens array, as per AppleInsider.

**Why It Matters:** Kuo had previously made the prediction regarding the telephoto lens design and given a timeline of 2022.

According to Kuo, Apple will also fine-tune iPhone’s optics this year and make the move from glass to plastic cover materials for Face ID.

The company also plans to add a new telephoto lens to its high-end models which will come with a 6P lens stack, an improvement from the 5P design found currently, as per Kuo.

Another green day for both the stocks. I would love to hear everyone's opinion on this, and I want evidence and new thoughts. NOT ""dey bof r gr33n so dey follo eachofer rocketshipemoji""

I believe no, we are not pumping because of them. Correlation =/= causation.

While BB is still on their watch list (you can see this from [https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/) chart he posted), I don't believe they are following each other due to the lack of volume BB has. I believe more that this is a dead-cat bounce due to being oversold (4/10 days have been red, prior to today), big institutions are averaging up (6 of the top 6 institution holders from [https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb) have all confirmed bought more shares, you can see this here by searching their names [https://fintel.io/so/us/bb](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb)), and the incredible amount of good news that's been released from $BB. The two press releases today premarket I'd recommend checking out.

To add to this, a large portion of stimulus checks from the US government is going to be added to stocks based on this article from CNBC [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/how-the-young-plan-to-spend-stimulus-checks-deutsche-bank.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/how-the-young-plan-to-spend-stimulus-checks-deutsche-bank.html)

How factual this statistic is, is hard to say. I believe BB is going to show a lot of strength and we could potentially have seen the bottom and we will finally see the crab pattern we've been waiting for.

DYOD. I'm not your financial advisor, I'm just another moron who eats red crayons but enjoys the green ones when given the opportunity. One time I ran out of lube for my Betty White fleshlight so I used carpenters glue instead. Feelsbadman.

Take care.

EDIT: Fixed some stuff. Also AMC is now trading above BB lol, look at the 1 month chart. AMC has pumped way harder than BB.

I believe more that this is a dead-cat bounce due to being oversold (4/10 days have been red, prior to today), big institutions are averaging up (6 of the top 6 institution holders from &lt;a href=""https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb""&gt;https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb&lt;/a&gt; have all confirmed bought more shares, you can see this here by searching their names &lt;a href=""https://fintel.io/so/us/bb""&gt;https://fintel.io/so/us/bb&lt;/a&gt;), and the incredible amount of good news that&amp;#39;s been released from $BB. The two press releases today premarket I&amp;#39;d recommend checking out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to this, a large portion of stimulus checks from the US government is going to be added to stocks based on this article from CNBC &lt;a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/how-the-young-plan-to-spend-stimulus-checks-deutsche-bank.html""&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/how-the-young-plan-to-spend-stimulus-checks-deutsche-bank.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How factual this statistic is, is hard to say. I believe BB is going to show a lot of strength and we could potentially have seen the bottom and we will finally see the crab pattern we&amp;#39;ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DYOD. I&amp;#39;m not your financial advisor, I&amp;#39;m just another moron who eats red crayons but enjoys the green ones when given the opportunity. One time I ran out of lube for my Betty White fleshlight so I used carpenters glue instead. Feelsbadman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Fixed some stuff. Also AMC is now trading above BB lol, look at the 1 month chart. AMC has pumped way harder than BB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT2: 10:32 Mountain time, Someone bought 650k shares.&lt;br/&gt;
EDIT3: 10:33 Mountain time, someone bought an additional 1.4 million shares. What in the fuck &lt;/p&gt;

Can you even imagine? Having that much of an advantage in regards to content and using that for your favour?

Can you even name 2 people sitting on the board of directors at your holdings? Head of Pepsi once replaced Jobs as CEO and it didn't end well. Company was dire for a change, very rapid one because he lacked vision. 

Apple will always adapt to the market, they will manufacture whatever consumers adapted widely from competition and they will simply make it better (mobile payments, VR Glasses in the future). 

Paramount had every single edge of advertising and brining eyes to their streaming service yet - they failed. And in my eyes that was free money and they shouldn't succeed with their streaming business. They could milk that interview so hard and yet - they showed a big middle finger to investors holding that garbage stock. 

Side note - we wanted to cut the cord, now we pay 7x what we used to for TV - most diversified streaming companies are going to win. I have to pay 250$ a month for my family plans so everyone can watch what they want, really? 

If management lacks vision - goodbye company. Maybe not today, not in 5 years, but people are holding stocks for 13-25 years having incredible gains but management has to stay on top of the game. Look deeply into whats happening behind closed doors. Insider trading is meaningless. One guy buys a yacht, second one has too much cash so he buys in, WE NEVER KNOW. 

I always start from lurking around LinkedIN, this is a crucial part of my DD to understand who will take care of my money. 

P/Es, technical analysys etc. - it's all very important but it wont protect you from long term stupidity of rich assholes not caring about the future. Hold your management accountable, ask questions during investor calls. 

I asked $VECO if they are going to enter semiconductor business, CFO made huge eyes and CEO responded with blunt date of 2027. I asked about using GaN (it's used in next-gen powerbanks and cables, better than lithium) in commercial products (they are in enterprise), also blunt response - sold that stock on the next market bell.

,stocks,"A lot of people (including my parents and me) suffered after 2008. We often hear ppl losing everything and getting set far back in lives. What we DON'T often hear, are people who loaded up in 2008. Regular average people. Those with small savings. Be it stocks or the housing market (which experienced a trailing small crash 2 years after). Those folks got literally everything on a massive discount.

Think about it from that angle. If I have SOME money saved up now and it were 2008 again, I would be fkin ecstatic. Because after 4-5 years I would gain 1000% easily. And that's not even going into real estate.

Also, recent example of last March will confirm my point. I made huge gains from it. I only bought Costco, Etsy and HomeDepot. No technical analysis. No charts. No graphs. Nothing. They were on sale and I assume people will be using them during the pandemic. Average intelligent move. There was no depth to it.

And even if you don't maximize your portfolio, literally buying any stocks on the dip will make you money in the long run. You can be dense and still make money.

So chill tf out. The dip IS AN OPPORTUNITY. It's a fking GIFT.

We're all familiar with ""buy the dip"". Well, here's the same principles with a minor tweak ""buy the (big) dip"".

There are 3 things for certain: death, tax and the stock market going up in the long run

**How does it work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth.

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock: UWM Holdings ($UWMC)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: +1286.9%

Month on Month increase in mentions: +2762%

Average sentiment across mentions: **+21.83%**

**Core Product**

United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers. Instead, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they mainly provide is consumers, lenders and institutions a simple process by which they can apply, compare and complete a mortgage application. They currently have one of the fastest and most effective consumer to lender processes due to their heavy investments into IT infrastructure (UWMC’s mortgage process takes an average of 17 days from start to finish when compared to the industry average of 47 days)

**Financials**

UWM had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.

UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. Their total loan volume amount for 2020 was $182.5B which was 69% higher than 2019.

Cash in hand also rose from 133M in 4Q-19 to 1.22B in 4Q-20. Credit quality of the loans improved with the weighted average FICO of 757 for the full year of 2020. This brought down the 60+ delinquency rates well below the industry average. UWMC also just declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

Russell index addition: UWMC is expected to be added into Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 index by end of March. This will force all the funds tracking these indices to add UWMC to their portfolio possibly driving the stock price higher.

Technology moat: UWMC invests heavily in IT infrastructure and technology. They develop all their technology with in-house developers. They have developed tools such as Blink+, UWM InTouch, and Brand 360 which enables them to have an industry-leading close time (almost twice as fast as Rocket and 3x as fast as the industry average)

Short interest: While the company is in no way similar to the GME case in short interest (140% which was a very rare event), it still is at 31% which is significantly higher than average. (source: fintel.io)

NPS score: They currently have the happiest customers among their competition with an NPS score 16% higher than that of Rocket (which is at 2nd place).

**Risk and Competition**

75% of the mortgage volume was based on refinancing ($42.9B new mortgages, $139.3B refinancing). This is predominantly driven by declining mortgage rates. If the mortgage rates increase, then UWMC’s refinancing volume will take a significant hit bringing down their revenues.

There is a lot of discussion around this being one of the reasons UWMC went public so as to capitalize on the refinance boom. I don’t completely buy this argument as company executives themselves are solidifying their position (Director of $UWMC just reported his SEC form 4, showing he more than doubled his own position on March 1st, from 50k to 110k shares).

The full impact of UWMC’s CEO's surprise announcement that they wouldn’t work with mortgage brokers that work with Rocket or Fairway Independent Mortgage is still not clear. UWMC has said that the split will take effect from March 15th.

**Conclusion**

This is the first time in my experience that a trending stock that has solid fundamentals is generating revenue, is profitable, and has no debt. Although there are some risks in terms of mortgage rates and the surprise announcement, I think the current market conditions put UWMC in a very strong position as a long-term play.

Long on SABR, the IT backend with full exposure to travel industry recovery. Revenue closely correlates with traveler count. Stock is poised for a short squeeze with 20% short interest.

\---

With the USA vaccine plan in full swing and the estimates of enough vaccines for all adults by May, travel stonks had a huge boost in confidence. With the summer travel season coming in hot, people are flocking to all kinds of travel stocks: airlines, cruises, hotels, casinos, etc. One that has been flying under the radar is $SABR, the Global Distribution System IT backend that services ALL these industries and benefits directly from increased travel numbers. As travel increases, their revenue directly correlates. In a nutshell, I like this stock for multiple reasons, including a position unique to SABR: a 20% short interest. As the population with immunization increases, pent up travel demand should cause a huge influx of leisure travel. IMO, I think the amount of leisure travel will exceed 2019’s as the world opens back up. Also, SABR is a better reopening play than airliners because business travel loss does not affect them as much.

# What is Sabre Technology?

Market Cap: 4.776B

Total Share Float: 317M

Institutional Ownership: 105% (yep, that’s higher than the float)

Sabre provides the infrastructure that allows major ticketing and booking sites to operate. They provide the data that allows sites like Expedia and Google Travel, and many others to operate. Their customer base includes:

· Expedia: Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotels.com, Tripadvisor.com, SeatGuru.com, Cheaptickets.com

· Booking: Kayak, Agoda, Priceline, CheapFlights, Momondo, OpenTable, RentalCars

· Google Flights and Hotels

· Hilton Worldwide

· Marriot

· Hyatt Hotels

· Caesars Entertainment

Essentially, they cover 35% market share of all travel booking transactions. Competitors include Travelport (not public), and Amadeus (mainly European travel). So, if you want a “picks and shovels” company with heavy exposure to the Northern Hemisphere’s travel industry, this would fit the bill. Another fantastic move they made at the start of 2020 was partnering with Google Cloud to create an AI driven solution that should create more value for their clients, while reducing overhead. The Sabre Travel AI development will be launching this year and bodes well for the technical moat that they are building. The fruits of this partnership should manifest in the coming years.

# Recovery Projections

Due to the close correlation between travelers and Sabre’s revenue, I took the liberty of modeling out the two datasets of Price and Travelers relative to each other.

[https://i.imgur.com/jJbmNRa.png](https://i.imgur.com/jJbmNRa.png[/img])

The correlation is relatively strong, and even demonstrate a breakout in speculation in the recent months due to positive vaccine news. As the number of travelers increase, a reversion to the mean should continue to carry the stock price upwards. I’m pretty bullish on the trend and think there’s plenty of upside to go in Q2 and Q3 of 2021. My price target is **$22** by end of year.

# But What about Business Travel?

The amount of total business travelers is expected to drop in the coming years as people realize they can sit in their bedroom on Zoom and not even put on pants while working. This is true, and SABR is pretty well positioned to handle it. Business travelers account for 12% of airlines’ passengers but drive more profit due to memberships and amenities. In some cases, they represent 75% of certain airlines’ revenues. So decreased business travel is absolutely brutal to airline companies. However, even if 12% of travelers never come back, SABR can shrug it off. Because their revenue correlates with **QUANTITY of travelers** **and not quality.** Looking at the above graph, even at a sustained average of 2M travelers, SABR share price should be trading around $20. For this reason, SABR is a better reopening play than airliners.

# Short Interest of 20%

For reasons that still elude me, Sabre has a relatively high short interest that continue to pile up, despite many signs of recovery. There are currently **61.3M shares sold short, with a total float of 317M.** Considering the daily volume of **\~6M**, we are looking at a situation where shorts will take **10 days to cover the entire position.** The smaller the daily volume, the more difficult it is for shorts to cover their position without causing a spike in price. This means that **SABR** **is poised for a short squeeze**. It may not happen violently like what we saw in some other meme stocks, but at the very least, it may cause natural buying pressure over time as the shorts unwind.

# Bear Case

The risk factors include:

· New debt from 2020 debt offerings and refinancing

· Share dilutions in the amount of \~$500 million

· $4.74B of long term debt (64.85M is current debt, which is easily covered with $1.5B in cash reserves)

· Delay in travel reopening, or more crazy COVID news

· Lower than expected travelers returning. Business travel is expected to decrease, but it impacts SABR far less than airliners.

Ultimately, this is a bet on the travel reopening. This is not financial advice, etc. Do your own due diligence and come to your own decision on what to do here. If you have issues with the DD, please poke some holes in it and let me know your bear case.

It may not happen violently like what we saw in some other meme stocks, but at the very least, it may cause natural buying pressure over time as the shorts unwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bear Case&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk factors include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· New debt from 2020 debt offerings and refinancing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Share dilutions in the amount of ~$500 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· $4.74B of long term debt (64.85M is current debt, which is easily covered with $1.5B in cash reserves)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Delay in travel reopening, or more crazy COVID news&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;· Lower than expected travelers returning. Business travel is expected to decrease, but it impacts SABR far less than airliners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is a bet on the travel reopening. This is not financial advice, etc. Do your own due diligence and come to your own decision on what to do here. If you have issues with the DD, please poke some holes in it and let me know your bear case.&lt;/p&gt;

**Nio is the undervalued EV play to consider in this dip.**

# Introduction

Let's get started. If this looks too long for you, please know that half of it is literally pictures. Just gonna say right here that I'm not going to be detailing this down to the point of analyzing every car model the company sells, even though it's probably important. Mainly because I'm lazy and don't want to write that much, but I am for sure no expert in cars at all and I don't have the qualifications to lecture you on car models. Maybe some car genius in the comments will. Also, I'm not gonna be discussing sector rotation or whatever. Figure out how to play it if based on your market thesis. Alright enough chit chat let's get to business.

Keep in mind the recent price range: $38-31

**Company Biography:**

NIO Limited designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The company offers five, six, and seven-seater electric SUVs. It is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users; marketing, design, and technology development activities; manufacture of e-powertrains, battery packs, and components; and sales and after sales management activities. In addition, the company offers charging solutions, including Power Home, a home charging solution; Power Swap, a battery swapping service; Power Mobile, a mobile charging service through charging trucks; Public Charger, a public fast charging solution; and Power Express, a 24-hour on-demand pick-up and drop-off charging service. Further, it provides value-added services, such as statutory and third-party liability insurance, and vehicle damage insurance through third-party insurers; repair and routine maintenance services; courtesy car services during lengthy repairs and maintenance; and roadside assistance, as well as data packages. NIO Limited has a strategic collaboration with Mobileye N.V. for the development of automated and autonomous vehicles; and collaboration agreements with various manufacturers for the manufacture of ES8, a six or seven-seater high-performance electric SUV.

So to summarize:

\- Sells and Manufactures a variety of luxury cars

\- Offers a multitude of charging solutions

\- Offers BaaS (Battery as a subscription service, meaning NIO owners subscribe and essentially rent out the battery for the car but we'll get to that later)

\- Provides vehicle damage insurance, statutory and third-party liability insurance (Statutory meaning its required by law to own)

\- Offers repair and routine maintenance services and roadside assistance, and data packages

Now that's a handful and we don't have all day, so we'll primarily be focusing on the main event which is their car line and BaaS. This does not mean you should disregard the other packages when viewing it as an investment, it just means I'm too lazy to do research on the other things.

&amp;#x200B;

# Market and Competition

**Market**

Honestly pretty much everyone knows where the EV market is heading and how it's the future, but it's worth mentioning regardless.

The EV market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21%, and hit 30 Million Cars worldwide by 2030. By 2026, worldwide EV revenue is expected hit roughly half a trillion USD, or $500 Billion. (Also, for those who aren't sure what a CAGR is, it means that the market on average is expected to grow by 21%. Not overall, but 21% year by year; take a second to appreciate the compound growth effect that will occur.) What's more, is that the Asia Pacific market (Where NIO primarily is) is reported to have the fastest growth. Here's a graph that represents these projections.

If we take a more specific look to NIO's market, analysts have recently upgraded previous forecasts, now claiming that 20% of the vehicle fleet will be EV by 2025. Beyond that, the forecasts for 2035 and 2050 are 53% and 80% penetration, respectively.

**Strategy**

The Chinese EV market has quite a few players on the board, so strategy is pretty important to differentiate and forge a unique business model. Nio's strategic goal is to have a consistent, stable order flow, rather than a fluctuating order backlog similar to Tesla. (Courtesy of J.P Morgan) By keeping pricing steady, Nio's focus lies on services and customer experience driving a positive reputation in the community and keeping engagement high; it also allows gross and vehicle margin to find stable ground as volumes rise.

We could also discuss their consumer relationship, and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out. [Apparently](https://web.archive.org/web/20210110170556if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kucf6r/chinese_autist_here_gonna_share_you_western/) Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla, but I don't have the experience to confirm that. Regardless, between their own app for owners, special owner events, and communal spaces, it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base.

BaaS. Battery as a Service. Or rather, a subscription. Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner, electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs. This shaves off roughly $10,000 off the price of their vehicles, which in turn boosts Nio's price competitiveness and demand. Also, BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far, and these swapping stations even support the EV's of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV's makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. You may be thinking, does this benefit the consumer in anyway? Sure it does. The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs. Some people aren't able to have their own home charging stations; many don't even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily. Also, consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can't afford to bleed money on certain battery solution, downgrade. Going on a large roadtrip? No problem, just rent a larger battery size. However, the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation. Instead of being stuck with a dated or low-end battery, all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery. What does this mean? Well, basically you don't need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute. Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack, and one size fits all. This improves resale value, and provides a future proof battery system. Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later), but I'm personally a fan because it's very pro-consumer, improves brand visibility (There's hundreds of these things and other EV's can use them attracting more traffic), and offers Nio Inc. another revenue stream. To recap: Extra revenue stream, easy to scale, brand visibility, and very pro-consumer.

Another thing that's worth mentioning is that the Chinese government favors BaaS companies when it comes to benefits, so there's that too.

**Catalysts**

I don't actually have a lot of research in this area, so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I'll add it in.

\- European Market Expansion

\- Rapid Clean Tech Movement

\- New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors

\- NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year

\- Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road. This is pure speculation, but here's an article written by [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-chinese-ev-maker-nio-might-be-coming-to-america-51612892800) claiming that Nio Inc. has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U.S. Market.

**Local environment**

Let's take a quick peek at Nio's infrastructure. As previously mentioned, they've chosen to offer battery as a subscription service, or BaaS for short. Now, we've already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice, but how well are they executing? As of right now, NIO currently has roughly 143 battery changing stations in China, and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more. Additionally, they've partnered with the Chinese state's grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations.

This all sounds great, right? We've discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they've established. There is of course, a predictable drawback that I should mention. Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way, other markets that lack China's battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into, because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio-power network that allows for battery swapping. Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets, because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas. Anyway, let's move on.

Now as you probably know, NIO is a China based EV company. Why is that a good thing exactly? Well, here's why. The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.  On top of that, China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world, and even further, they're the largest investor in renewable energies. OK, IDGAF where's the relation to cars? It's not super concrete, but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China's firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy. They've been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy, so you know they'll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible. Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals, and how large the Chinese EV market is/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow. Actually, let's take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts.

\- China is the *largest* EV market in the world, representing roughly *50%* of worldwide sales.

\- From 2019 to 2020, Chinese EV sales increased *550%,* from 200,00 units to 1,300,000 units.

\- China expects sales to grow nearly *40%* this year despite the pandemic, growing from 1,300,000 units to over 1,800,000 units.

Between these statistics and China's firm stance on clean tech and the EV market, we can conclude that NIO's local environment is well suited for growth and stability.

# Financials and Numbers

Not gonna do much talking here, just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will.

**Q4 Positive Highlights and Outlook**

* Q4 Revenues grew 46.7% Quarter over Quarter, reaching $1.02 Billion, while many expected $1.04 Billion.
* Deliveries reached 17,000 Units for Q4. For reference they sold 40,000 units in 2020.
* NIO projects 20,000+ Units for Q1 of 2021, which is 15% quarter over quarter. Again, for reference they sold 40,000 units for 2020. What's more is that in Q1 2020, they only sold 4k cars but in Q1 2021 they're projected to do **400%** that number a year later. This type of growth is probably the most appealing aspect to potential investors the way I see it.
* Gross and Vehicle Margin grew to 17.2%
* NIO generated positive cash-flow
* Despite the tech restraints from battery/chip shortages, management says production levels will be able to remain 'normal'
* Even with the production constraints through Q2, NIO's outright delivery and revenue growth are visible - the company is on track to deliver nearly the same amount of cars in Q1/Q2 as it had in 2020.
* NIO trades at about 13.1x projected FY21 revenues

**Q4 Negative Highlights**

* Due to the Semiconductor/Chip Shortage, NIO is expecting a bit of a bump in the road in terms of deliveries in the early half of the year
* With the combination of chip and battery constraints, NIO expects monthly production through Q2 to cap around \~7,500 units,  a 25% decrease from Q1 projections.
* Net Loss for Q4 clocked in at $1.3 Billion USD
* Operating Losses weren't reduced a whole lot
* Missed EPS estimates
* No dividend

# Investment Outlook

**Analyst Consensus**

Need a third opinion? This is one of the **biggest green flags** IMO. These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is. Here's a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks. Please keep in mind NIO's recent price activity: 31-38 (As of Mar. 5)

Price targets:

\- HSBC: $49

\- Morgan Stanley: $80

\- J.P. Morgan: $75

\- Deutsche: $70

\- Bank of America: $70

\- Goldman Sachs: $64

\- Daiwa: $100

**Conclusion**

Obviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic, especially the Asia Pacific market, but I'm also a big fan of their strategic approach. Feel free to debate me on that. I've also heard a lot of praise regarding their management, seen a lot of fans of [William Li](https://www.forbes.com/profile/william-li/?sh=894e17911a13), calling him a genius and the 'Elon Musk of China'. There's a couple things I've missed in this DD; I probably should've touched on the competition, their other services/packages, and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles, but I'm really no expert in those fields so I'll leave that to others.

For this thesis, I think it's important to keep in mind how much the price has dipped recently. I mean within the past month it's been as high as 61, and as low as 31. EV's have taken a beating in these red days, and may even continue to decrease. I personally find any prices under 35 extremely appealing, but that general sub 40 area is pretty solid IMO. Hell, it almost went sub 30 on the 5th. I primarily like the growth opportunity Nio presents, especially when considering the discount its been at. It's also important to recognize that these dips may continue with tech/growth/EV stocks, so probably factor that into your opinion and remember to also consider the long term prospect.

This took hours, hope you enjoyed.

My positions: None, I'm absolutely broke, I just like to write analyses and research.

**TL;DR**

**-** Good growth opportunity

\- Good market (Local environment too)

\- Good strategic approach

&lt;p&gt;We could also discuss their consumer relationship, and how their dealerships double as community grounds for owners to hang out. &lt;a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20210110170556if_/https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kucf6r/chinese_autist_here_gonna_share_you_western/""&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt; Nio has even more of a cult then Tesla, but I don&amp;#39;t have the experience to confirm that. Regardless, between their own app for owners, special owner events, and communal spaces, it is clear that Nio strives to form a strong and loyal customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BaaS. Battery as a Service. Or rather, a subscription. Nio has chosen to distribute batteries in a non-traditional manner, electing to not include it with the sale of their vehicles and instead letting consumers chose and rent batteries depending on their personal needs. This shaves off roughly $10,000 off the price of their vehicles, which in turn boosts Nio&amp;#39;s price competitiveness and demand. Also, BaaS acts as an additional revenue source for Nio that will continue to generate cash by nature even if sales take a hit. Nio has hit roughly 1 Million battery swaps thus far, and these swapping stations even support the EV&amp;#39;s of other automakers. This flexibility of compatibility with other EV&amp;#39;s makes Nio-power (The battery swapping stations) much easier to scale. You may be thinking, does this benefit the consumer in anyway? Sure it does. The custom battery solutions offer a chance for consumers to cater to their own needs. Some people aren&amp;#39;t able to have their own home charging stations; many don&amp;#39;t even have a consistent parking spot they can rely on daily. Also, consumers can customize depending on their own driving habits; if you can&amp;#39;t afford to bleed money on certain battery solution, downgrade. Going on a large roadtrip? No problem, just rent a larger battery size. However, the most appealing benefit to consumers is the protection from battery degradation. Instead of being stuck with a dated or low-end battery, all Nio vehicles use the same size of battery. What does this mean? Well, basically you don&amp;#39;t need to worry about the value of your battery depreciating as new advancements make it absolute. Consumers can upgrade to the latest and most powerful battery pack, and one size fits all. This improves resale value, and provides a future proof battery system. Overall the BaaS may attract a decent amount of controversy (it does have some drawbacks that I touch on later), but I&amp;#39;m personally a fan because it&amp;#39;s very pro-consumer, improves brand visibility (There&amp;#39;s hundreds of these things and other EV&amp;#39;s can use them attracting more traffic), and offers Nio Inc. another revenue stream. To recap: Extra revenue stream, easy to scale, brand visibility, and very pro-consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that&amp;#39;s worth mentioning is that the Chinese government favors BaaS companies when it comes to benefits, so there&amp;#39;s that too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalysts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t actually have a lot of research in this area, so if anyone in the comments recalls a catalyst or two share it and I&amp;#39;ll add it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- European Market Expansion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Rapid Clean Tech Movement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- New Manufacturing Base run by JAC Motors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- NIO partnership with Chinese industrial park at Hefei, which will reportedly produce 300,000 clean energy vehicles a year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Speculation: Potential expansion to the American Market down the road. This is pure speculation, but here&amp;#39;s an article written by &lt;a href=""https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-chinese-ev-maker-nio-might-be-coming-to-america-51612892800""&gt;Barron&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; claiming that Nio Inc. has been attempting to formulate an action plan to enter the U.S. Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a quick peek at Nio&amp;#39;s infrastructure. As previously mentioned, they&amp;#39;ve chosen to offer battery as a subscription service, or BaaS for short. Now, we&amp;#39;ve already talked about the strategy and benefits behind this choice, but how well are they executing? As of right now, NIO currently has roughly 143 battery changing stations in China, and they plan to almost double that number by adding 100 more. Additionally, they&amp;#39;ve partnered with the Chinese state&amp;#39;s grid to help establish these new battery swapping stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all sounds great, right? We&amp;#39;ve discussed the benefits of a BaaS system and looked over the infrastructure they&amp;#39;ve established. There is of course, a predictable drawback that I should mention. Because NIO has decided to manufacture and run their company this way, other markets that lack China&amp;#39;s battery swapping infrastructure will be harder to crack into, because they will require heavy investment and development to create a Nio-power network that allows for battery swapping. Just something to keep in mind when considering European and North American markets, because there has been some buzz about NIO entering those areas. Anyway, let&amp;#39;s move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as you probably know, NIO is a China based EV company. Why is that a good thing exactly? Well, here&amp;#39;s why. The Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.  On top of that, China is the largest Wind and Solar energy producer in the world, and even further, they&amp;#39;re the largest investor in renewable energies. OK, IDGAF where&amp;#39;s the relation to cars? It&amp;#39;s not super concrete, but there is one; these pieces of evidence prove China&amp;#39;s firm and absolute take on clean tech and energy. They&amp;#39;ve been busting their butts and paying and arm and a leg in the cause of clean energy, so you know they&amp;#39;ll do everything they can to implement it as much as possible. Also it should make you feel more confident in their goals, and how large the Chinese EV market is/How fast the Chinese EV market will grow. Actually, let&amp;#39;s take a closer look at the Chinese environment with some numbers and facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- China is the &lt;em&gt;largest&lt;/em&gt; EV market in the world, representing roughly &lt;em&gt;50%&lt;/em&gt; of worldwide sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- From 2019 to 2020, Chinese EV sales increased &lt;em&gt;550%,&lt;/em&gt; from 200,00 units to 1,300,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- China expects sales to grow nearly &lt;em&gt;40%&lt;/em&gt; this year despite the pandemic, growing from 1,300,000 units to over 1,800,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between these statistics and China&amp;#39;s firm stance on clean tech and the EV market, we can conclude that NIO&amp;#39;s local environment is well suited for growth and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Financials and Numbers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not gonna do much talking here, just sharing some numbers and you make with it what you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q4 Positive Highlights and Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q4 Revenues grew 46.7% Quarter over Quarter, reaching $1.02 Billion, while many expected $1.04 Billion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliveries reached 17,000 Units for Q4. For reference they sold 40,000 units in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NIO projects 20,000+ Units for Q1 of 2021, which is 15% quarter over quarter. Again, for reference they sold 40,000 units for 2020. What&amp;#39;s more is that in Q1 2020, they only sold 4k cars but in Q1 2021 they&amp;#39;re projected to do &lt;strong&gt;400%&lt;/strong&gt; that number a year later. This type of growth is probably the most appealing aspect to potential investors the way I see it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross and Vehicle Margin grew to 17.2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NIO generated positive cash-flow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the tech restraints from battery/chip shortages, management says production levels will be able to remain &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even with the production constraints through Q2, NIO&amp;#39;s outright delivery and revenue growth are visible - the company is on track to deliver nearly the same amount of cars in Q1/Q2 as it had in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NIO trades at about 13.1x projected FY21 revenues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q4 Negative Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the Semiconductor/Chip Shortage, NIO is expecting a bit of a bump in the road in terms of deliveries in the early half of the year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the combination of chip and battery constraints, NIO expects monthly production through Q2 to cap around ~7,500 units,  a 25% decrease from Q1 projections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Loss for Q4 clocked in at $1.3 Billion USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating Losses weren&amp;#39;t reduced a whole lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Missed EPS estimates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No dividend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Investment Outlook&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyst Consensus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need a third opinion? This is one of the &lt;strong&gt;biggest green flags&lt;/strong&gt; IMO. These ratings really show how undervalued NIO truly is. Here&amp;#39;s a compilation of some price targets from some of the biggest and most influential banks. Please keep in mind NIO&amp;#39;s recent price activity: 31-38 (As of Mar. 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price targets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- HSBC: $49&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Morgan Stanley: $80&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- J.P. Morgan: $75&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Deutsche: $70&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Bank of America: $70&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Goldman Sachs: $64&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Daiwa: $100&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the EV market and the growth opportunity it presents is fantastic, especially the Asia Pacific market, but I&amp;#39;m also a big fan of their strategic approach. Feel free to debate me on that. I&amp;#39;ve also heard a lot of praise regarding their management, seen a lot of fans of &lt;a href=""https://www.forbes.com/profile/william-li/?sh=894e17911a13""&gt;William Li&lt;/a&gt;, calling him a genius and the &amp;#39;Elon Musk of China&amp;#39;. There&amp;#39;s a couple things I&amp;#39;ve missed in this DD; I probably should&amp;#39;ve touched on the competition, their other services/packages, and done a thorough breakdown on their vehicles, but I&amp;#39;m really no expert in those fields so I&amp;#39;ll leave that to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this thesis, I think it&amp;#39;s important to keep in mind how much the price has dipped recently. I mean within the past month it&amp;#39;s been as high as 61, and as low as 31. EV&amp;#39;s have taken a beating in these red days, and may even continue to decrease. I personally find any prices under 35 extremely appealing, but that general sub 40 area is pretty solid IMO. Hell, it almost went sub 30 on the 5th. I primarily like the growth opportunity Nio presents, especially when considering the discount its been at. It&amp;#39;s also important to recognize that these dips may continue with tech/growth/EV stocks, so probably factor that into your opinion and remember to also consider the long term prospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This took hours, hope you enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My positions: None, I&amp;#39;m absolutely broke, I just like to write analyses and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt; Good growth opportunity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Good market (Local environment too)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Good strategic approach&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- The bigwig banks have price targets way higher above where it currently sits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Huge dip (50% at one point)&lt;/p&gt;

I was forbidden from talking to technical support because they already knew about it. I still don't have my money back. They never publicly acknowledged the problem. I'm now going through FINRA arbitration. (Reference myself)

DISCLOSURE: I have about $50k worth of puts on $SCHW, which I purchased after having discovered enough of this. To be clear, though, I bought the puts as a result of this information. Not the other way around.

This is not financial advice. But I do not think you should trust this company.

Also, side note: Schwab owns TD Ameritrade. They acquired them last year.",t2_32e59,False,,0,False,Schwab is a *dangerous* company and may be insolvent. Here's a big list of serious red flags.

&lt;p&gt;Take this all with a grain of salt, and use your own judgment regarding the veracity of these claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwab, after acquiring TD Ameritrade, has over $7 trillion in assets under management, and about $50B in equity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only takes an error of 0.7% of their assets to cause them to go insolvent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over a month ago, a bug made me go naked short GME in my 401(k) cash account (this is illegal). This caused me to lose $180k in my retirement account when I covered it. Schwab had no explanation. I was forbidden from talking to technical support because they already knew about it. I still don&amp;#39;t have my money back. They never publicly acknowledged the problem. I&amp;#39;m now going through FINRA arbitration. (Reference myself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The above bug, if you know how to reproduce it, is an infinite money glitch for criminals. According to other user comments, this infinite money glitch has existed for over 7 months. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2s81j/i_own_negative_shares_in_a_stock/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i2s81j/i_own_negative_shares_in_a_stock/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The big thing that really tipped me off was how many other people are aware of the bug. When I posted about it, I got 60+ &amp;quot;this happened to me too&amp;quot; type comments. Seriously, look for yourself. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Phantom shares&amp;quot;. This is either a grave error, or a hack, or accounting fraud, at any rate another separate and potentially massive disaster.

,stocks,"Hey y'all,

As the market transitions out of growth and tech stocks and into value, I want to position myself appropriately. these same stocks that have gone done 20-30% in the past two weeks are the same stocks that every wanted to buy a month ago, touted by Wall Street analysts but didn't due to valuation and recent growth fallacy. If you could pick a handful of high growth companies to buy and hold for the next few years, which would they be? Looking back on the March dip, it is crazy to see how cheap some of these stocks got.

I'm aiming for 10x on each pick, obviously there is a high likelihood none of these 10x but, to justify investment with a high risk tolerance and long time horizon it makes little sense for me to buy an AAPL or MSFT-mature growth

Looking back on it, I wish I had bought SQ, ROKU, TSLA, SHOP before they blew up these past couple of years into what they are today,. What, in your eyes are those stocks and why? Sure they could still be SQ ROKU and SHOP and I will continue to add these on red days.

My research has led me to consider the following:

**IPOE** (Sofi), I really like Square and may add it but its market cap is already 100 billion. I haven't done nearly enough DD and would love to hear other's take on it. Little scared the lending side of the company comprises too much of the business but it could give the co a nice backbone to pair with their brand's higher growth components: Galileo acquisition and trading platform

**ROKU:** Love the company, obviously tough competition but seems they are outpacing amazon and changing the way our streaming services are monetized- not sure if we'll ever see 400 billion here but I also really like **MGNI** and the pullback its given us.

**SPTK**: to me, this gives off plug energy vibes. It has a relatively small market cap, approx. 5 billion depending on the day and is a market leader in AI, clean energy. Massive TAM. I could go more in depth but I think its well positioned to grow in coming years.

Next up is **Unity(U) and C3 AI(AI)**: I am grouping these together because both are still extremely expensive based on valuation and are recent IPOs but have lots of long term growth ahead in both their respectable spaces, AR/VR and AI

**TDOC:** Huge fan of Cathie Woods but I struggle to develop conviction in this oen and would love to hear what you guys think of it- was a fan of livongo but it seems like that area of the high flying business has been

**PINS:** lotta potential here, theres a reason MSFT has tried to acquire these guys

**UPWK/FVRR**: As society becomes increasingly postmodern, the gig economy will only continue to expand, pricy now and set for correction as we transition out of covid but am long.

**ARKK, ARKF (any one of the ARK funds really)**: set and forget. Harder to get the exponential gains when portfolio allocation is capped at 10% maximum but still offer great exposure to tech with little worry knowing Cathie is running the show

**ETSY:** niche that not even Amazon can compete w, like the company alot esp after how they crushed earnings. Undeniably a benefactor of covid and could see more pull back

Notable mentions: CRWD, NET, ZM, LMND
