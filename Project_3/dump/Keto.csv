,keto,"So, tbh I'm scared af to post this. Like, really scared. But I'm losing some motivation and tried these pants I wore last year and they are so loose! I don't see much difference in my body but the pants are so different. These were my favourite pair last year. 
In a couple days I'm 2 months on keto. Started at January 15th. Goal is to reach that 199 pounds this or next month. 
Right now I'm at 207.  Started at 233. I'm 5'8.

I do feel like it's not going fast enough. I know that is stupid, but I'm not seeing the results in real life so I was hoping sharing this pic does.
I do wanna thank this sub for all those succes stories, I really need them to keep me going.

I don&amp;#39;t see much difference in my body but the pants are so different. These were my favourite pair last year. 
In a couple days I&amp;#39;m 2 months on keto. Started at January 15th. Goal is to reach that 199 pounds this or next month. 
Right now I&amp;#39;m at 207.  Started at 233. I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;8.&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"25F. Freaking out at 2 am. Wondering if my sore throat is because of covid, food poisoning, or keto flu. I'm getting tested just in case but I'd love any insight at all on this. 

Background info: 
I started March 1st. Bought 3lbs of kielbasa and other meats but in the first few days of keto, I've been eating foods that I thought were too salty. Now I think that probably helped me early on. After a few days, I started eating foods with less salt in it. That might have been a mistake. I work on a national wildlife refuge so I'm outdoors pretty often and because its federal, don't encounter many others. I also made keto salmon rolls with seaweed snacks, cream cheese, and cucumber all wrapped together. I kept that in the fridge and had it for lunch yesterday after microwaving it. 

It tasted good but I felt disgusting after (diarrhea, light nausea, no headache no vomiting). I'm mildly lactose intolerant so I attributed it to that but I also wondered if was mild food poisoning. my parents also had salmon (not salmon rolls) but they're fine.

A few hours after lunch, I felt a lot better. But I couldnt get rid of this bitter taste in the back of my throat. And now its developed into a sore throat.

,keto,"Hi everyone! 

Long time lurker, found sooo many answers by reading posts here! I’ve on keto since last August, lost a little over 50 lbs (I’m not sure of my starting weight though), went from a tight xxl to a well fitting large. I’m now 183, 5’7’’ and I’m aiming for 150-155 and getting out of the overweight zone. Best part is I got rid of diabetes!!!! 

Now I have a question I couldn’t find an answer for here. My husband and I are thinking of trying for our last baby soon. But someone on a ttc forum told me conceiving on keto is dangerous. I know it is not good during pregnancy so I was planning on going back to low carb once I get a positive. But she insisted that it is dangerous at the time of conception. She couldn’t give me a clear answer on why, she just stated that not many studies were done, and we don’t know how long the effects of keto lasts. So this is all a little confusing to me, and disappointing. I already have to deal with irregular cycles and a husband who works away on a 14/14 schedule so the timing is already an issue. I don’t want to wait too long, I’m 35 and while I know many women conceive later, all my mothers side off the family went into menopause at 38, and it is likely that the same will happen to me. 

Does anybody here know the actual answer as to why it is dangerous for sperm to meet egg and grow into an embryo on keto, even before said embryo is even exchanging blood with the mother? Women here conceived on keto? What was the outcome? 

And here’s a little less important question; I cheated last Saturday on my birthday. I had pizza, fries, and cake. I avoided weighing myself for 2 days after. But today I’m still 3 lbs heavier than before I cheated. I know most of it is water weight, but would it take that long to go away? This can’t be 3 lbs of fat right???

,keto,"In 2016 I met the love of my life. My income also improved drastically and with it the ability to eat and drink just about whatever I wanted. Life was a celebration and we enjoyed many amazing meals and partied like it was 1984. And with the happiness came the kilograms. We got married February last year and by that time I had Shot up from 90kgs, which for 1.79m was already overweight, to 114Kgs. We have not processed our wedding photos. 

As the weight piled tasks I could normally do with ease became really difficult. I love DIY but having to bend down to look for tools in my toolbox became a huge effort. Everything was an effort. 

I was well aware of the effect the weight gain was having on me, but I knew in order for me to be successful in losing the weight I would need to stop drinking, not something I really wanted to do. 

Even though I would wake up early hours of the morning guilt ridden about what I was doing to myself, I thought to myself, what does a person do if you quit drinking... it seemed really boring. 

We tried to compromise by cutting down on the booze and ate healthier but still nothing was happening and the weight kept increasing. Every day's bottle and some's wine, and whatever else, would leave us waking up lethargic and I would need that extra meal to help myself recover from my hangover, just about every day (won't even mention weekends and holidays).

To get real with myself I would equate my weight with blocks of butter. After struggling to get out of a swimming hole because I could not lift myself up, I took my stepson to the shopping center and packed 60 500g blocks of butter into a block to show him how much I need to lose. The following year or two I picked up another few kgs since then until I reached 119kgs. It's funny concept but the picture kept stuck in my head. Imagine walking around with a few shopping bags worth of butter every day, then  going to bed with that butter. And now stack those cubes of butter all over yourself like a suicide vest and imagine what it looks like. Its uncomfortable, unhealthy and not good. 

A new talent I acquired was to be able to rest a beer on my stomach hands free... it was time for change. It was not worth the everyday backache and foot pain and a general lack of zest for life. Aside from that there was hardly any clothes that fitted when going shopping... a big indictment on retail.

3 weeks ago, after many failed attempts, we finally took the plunge. No booze, 16:8 Intermittent fasting, and a Keto diet. I know they say to ease in, but I knew if we did not see results we would lose interest. 

The results have been astounding and many of the fears I had turned out to be completely unfounded lies we told ourselves that kept us trapped in our apathy. Once we got going it turned out to be much easier than I had anticipated. 

My energy was up, I sleep like that tree that fell in the forest, and I have suddenly found the will to do all the things I had been putting off for so long. 

My skin cleared up, my organs are no longer paining anymore (also no more dread of what conditions I may be getting as a result of my excessive lifestyle),  and I have just an enormous sense of well being. I have lost 6.5kgs, my wife 4kgs, and I no longer am bulging out of clothes that are too small for me. We are also saving ALOT.

I must add, we are not calorie counting for now, but the combination of the 3 is really working well for us. We eat enough but we don't pig out. An Omelette at lunch and a solid meal at night with a meaty snack in between if we need it. If we stall at some point down the road we will become more clinical. 

I know it has only been 3 weeks, but looking back I now realise how we had been slowly poisoning ourselves. 

Our low carb diet has been amazing and has really helped curb my insatiable hunger pangs, but I would never have been able to keep this up if I did not make a break with alcohol. Perhaps others can do it, but for us it would never have worked. We planned to do this until middle may but I am concerned that should we go back and celebrate, the gains we fought so hard for will be lost on a wayward path of small compromises. 

For now, for both my wife and I, the celebration is living a fuller life with more energy, focus and purpose; and I am determined to persevere and finally maintain.

,keto,"Hello. For a long time i have been trying to stay on keto long term, but i have always failed, going no further than 30 days maximum. However, when i did stay on keto properly i saw great results in terms of weight loss, mental health and stable energy levels. I mostly contribute this to the fact that i did OMAD every day with no problem, as i am using Concerta medicine for my ADHD which completely eliminated my hunger for the whole day. My problem is not the food, the fasting and the carb restrictions that generally comes with a ketogenic diet, in fact 95% of the time spent on keto was effortless as i am concerned, and it felt completely natural for me to stay on such a low carb diet for a long period of time.

My problem is the extreme sugar cravings that kick in generally sometimes in the weekends, as my mind gets completely fixated on having a cosy evening watching a movie whilst eating candy and eating pizza (an example). I have always had a sweet tooth, and i cant seem to eliminate it. This is what annoys me so much with the ketogenic diet. It is perfect for me and feels natural almost all of the time, but the fact that i cant cheat just once in a while without feeling completely ill and depressed after having a cheat day is whats stopping me from actually committing to it long term.

Now, i know that there may be several solutions to this, and it may seem weak and low effort of me to not soldier though these moments of personal weakness. Believe me, i have tried different methods to combat this; eating keto friendly snacks at planned moments, drinking sugar free sodas, eating a variety of proper ketogenic foods and getting large amounts of water and sodium throughout the day.

Yet, the sugar cravings always come back crawling in the background, and it is extremely mentally draining when they come. When the cravings come they stay there for several hours, no matter what i do. For me, food and comfort eating has always been mentally relaxing and rewarding, and that does not mean that i do it like every other day. Its just knowing that once in a while i can go all out and have a small feast that makes longevity a possible factor for me. However, cheating and keto is not something thats compatible for long term commitment, and i know this from experience and reading a lot about other peoples experience with the diet.

What made me write this post is essentially the last method that i think may work, but it sounds so radical. As many of you might know, sugar alcohols may stimulate cravings, and i think that may be whats holding me back. I say this knowingly; if i KNEW that eating strict keto and totally avoiding fake sugars would kill my cravings, i would have no problem sticking to the diet. No problem. Yet it sounds so radical to cut out sugar alcohols even though i know that it might be the solution to my problem. I really want to stay on this diet for long period of time, as i know that it makes me feel great in all aspects. Its just that i do not believe that cutting out all foods that may stimulate these cravings will work (foods containing sugar alcohols), so i do not know if its worth to be this strict if it is not going to yield results. Food has always been important to me, and what notion i have gathered among people who have done keto long term successfully is that they start to just view food as fuel, and not comfort. Im gonna be honest, to be it seems that if you want to do keto long term, you HAVE to change the way you view food if you want to achieve a life free of cravings, and it seems too mentally painful and radical to do that.

Im sure some people on here has had this problem in some sort of way, so i would greatly appreciate any personal experiences or ""tips"" that might help me. Im sorry if this post was a bit messy, and please feel free to ask me any questions if it would help understanding my situation better.

,keto,"Hi folks,

I have just got back from working offshore for 7 weeks on an Italian vessel, after the first 3 days straight of pasta/bread/rice I felt awful and vowed to not have another bite of these foods. I decided to start keto on 16:8 and asked the cook for meat and fish (all they had were lean cuts). Unfortunately because I started whilst I was away for work, I didn't have scales to track food or bodyweight and I didn't have any electrolytes to supplement, which meant keto flu struck hard and fast. There was also no onboard gym to exercise so I did what I could in my cabin, a few bodyweight exercises.

Anyway, I struggled through and I'm finally back home, I jumped on the scale and discovered I had lost 22lbs since leaving, having been surrounded by refined carbohydrates the whole time! I am also now loaded up on electrolytes and feel invincible, time to start tracking my food obsessively and smashing the weights to shed the remaining 21lbs!

Keep going folks, with a bit of discipline and perseverance you can and will achieve great results!

I have done keto on a off for a few years. The longest I ever stuck to it was for about 3 months, and I lost 30 pounds, which I quickly gained back (+ more, thanks pandemic stress) when I stopped. The problem I mostly ran into was dinners. I have preschooler twins, and a husband, and keto meals aren't really their thing. 

Now I'm in a panic, because my latest blood work shows I'm pre-diabetic. I also have insulin resistance/PCOS, but I've known about that. So now I really have to get into it, and stick with it. I'm drawing blanks and what kind of meals I can make that while not keto, I can easily swap part of the meal with a keto option for just myself. These swaps have to be EASY. I work full time, and have daycare drop off and pick up each day. 

I need ideas from people who have successfully managed to do keto, while their families not so much, and didn't kill themselves in the kitchen achieving it.

,keto,"I’m here to encourage those who may be struggling, or are undecided about joining our awesome keto Reddit fam.

In late November 2020, I found myself utterly alone.  All of my friends and family had moved out of state earlier in the year, and it left me incredibly heartbroken and lonely, especially at the start of the holiday season.  I decided to pour that negative energy into something from which I could benefit, figuring the distraction would divert attention away from my sadness.  The pic on the left was taken a week after my best friends moved to NC, and I had just started keto.  The pic on the right is at 90 days.  

I had a feeling there were changes going on, because I feel AMAZING, the best I’ve felt since my 20s (I’m 51).

Anyway, I just wanted to put these pics out there for  multiple reasons.  Keto works at any age, and as long as you keep at it, you WILL see change, though it’s not always obvious when we look in the mirror.

The nitty gritty:  I’m sticking to pretty typical keto macros:  75-78% fat, 18-20% protein, 5-ish% net carbs, and 1400 calories per day.  I’m doing CICO and tracking via an app called Lose It, which also picks up on negative and positive patterns so that I can correct bad behaviors and reinforce good ones.  I also wear an Apple Watch and follow a 4 days on, 1 day off fitness routine (500 calories in cardio, plus light weights).

Hope this post reaches someone needing encouragement.  Feel free to DM with questions, or if you need Spotify playlists for motivation.  I have tons!

Sending love and hugs to this community.  I have big goals this year, and have all of you to thank. 💪❤️

 I used the keto calculator to figure out my macros, have a decent caloric deficit, exercise regularly, hydrate well, watch my electrolytes, and I'm always under 20g net carbs. I've tried cutting back a little more on fats to try to get past the plateau.

This is not my first time on keto, and I am far better educated than I was last time. Under the fat, I am actually in better shape than last time too. But for some reason I can't seem to lose the last 15-ish lbs that just seemed to melt off last time. The only difference is I was 1 year postpartum when I started last time, and this time I'm about 8 months postpartum. Is that enough to make a difference?

,keto,"So I struggle with low testosterone and also sugar problems. I got tested way back a few years ago and had very very low test to be 22 . 

I’m skinny have some facial hair but sleep shit and can’t put on muscle. I’ve eaten low carb for probably 5 years

I just started keto recently. It makes me feel good especially after I eat. 


Although someone told me it raises total test

And lowers free test due to increase in sbhg


So I feel bad high carb and a little irritated fasted
I wonder if that’s from test problems


My question is should I continue keto and see my doctor or get off of it and then get tested.

I’m planning to get a sleep study done. I’ve felt so bad the last five years and had no idea what it was until recently.

,keto,"I recently discovered my love for these birds on the rotisserie.....i mean on the ones they sell on the streets, a whole bird, crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside, and that seasoning on the outside, to die for. And best of all, still flaming hot out of the machine.

This is my go to, i have found my fast food place who sells these birds like a hot cake. Best 7 dollars iam spending for fast food and now i get even full after eating that and iam still full in Keto, my god why havent i discovered this before ?

Edit: Because some asked, these are the stands who sell them in germany, open like hot dog cars or inside buildings as a open front door shop.

,keto,"I tried full blown keto for about a month last year and quickly got discouraged because I honestly found it so stressful having to count my macros, log all the food I ate, worrying about having to eat so much fat all day etc etc. I also didn’t really vibe with weighing myself daily because my weight would really fluctuate and the whole, lose one pound gain 2 dance just really got in my head and made me lose motivation.

So I decided that I want to try “lazy” keto this time and just make things simpler!

My plan is, I’m going to cut out all processed sugar and stop my snacking habit (it’s always ice cream and whatever other sweets I can get my hands on after dinner because I love sweets 😭) - I’m also going to do a sort of lax intermittent fasting, and try to adhere to the following eating schedule: bulletproof coffee at 9 am, then lunch at noon, dinner around 6 and a small snack for dessert, no eating after 7 pm.

Some of the things I’m planning on incorporating into my daily regimen:

My bulletproof coffee recipe - black coffee with collagen powder, cocoa butter and a dash of cinnamon (since it helps lower blood sugar and I know I have issues with insulin resistance) 

A cup of bone broth for lunch along with something like eggs and sausage or a couple strips of bacon, or some low carb avocado toast (I need more ideas for things I can eat for lunch lol)

Dinner is usually pretty varied! We usually eat pretty healthy for dinner, it’s usually some kind of good quality meat (salmon, ribeye, chicken thighs, pork chops, shrimp, all sorts of tasty things) with a side of veggies, usually like asparagus, green beans, Brussels sprouts etc. I’m going to cut out things like potatoes, bread and pasta altogether and stay away from starchy veggies in general. I know some things like green beans can have higher amounts of net carbs but idk if I’m trying to go THAT restrictive into keto yet... I mostly just need to stay motivated to create discipline with the way I eat and cut out the really unhealthy habits like eating lots of carbs and sugar and eating late at night.

I just wanted to see if anyone has any tips on whether this routine i have planned out sounds good to you guys? Anything else you would add or do differently?

I also wanted to ask around for ideas for low carb snacks I can look into, and ideas for lunch recipes that I can add into my routine! I’m gonna get bored of eggs + sausage and avocado toast at some point lol

,keto,"I take a magnesium supplement so that doesn't trouble me, but I am finding it hard to get enough Na and K on keto. Very ironic as I was addicted to crisps and salty foods before!

,keto,"[https://youtu.be/VUExZ9FNUCk](https://youtu.be/VUExZ9FNUCk)

The misinformation they spewed in this video is just appalling. This video is only 2 years old, so they don't have the excuse of not having studied this diet. But, they still initially act like it's some kind of fringe diet they don't understand and have barely heard of. But later on, they even mention that people they know, including patients, have successfully used the diet to lose large amounts of weight.

The bulk of their criticism of the ketogenic diet seems to stem from their conflation of ketosis with ketoacidosis. After hearing this garbage, I can't believe these people have medical degrees.

In case you don't want to watch the video, here are some lowlights in their discussion of keto before they start pimping the Mediterranean and DASH diets:

* 0:30 - ""Ketosis -- What can go wrong? (laughter) Sounds a little dangerous.""
* 3:46 - ""When I think about ketosis, sometimes I get a little nervous. I think, gosh, we don't really want you in ketosis.""
* 4:06 - ""Really, when you think about what ketosis is, it's an alternative pathway that our body has to use in times of emergency and times when your brain needs energy and, for some reason, there's not food, particularly carbohydrates, because that's the fuel your brain prefers.""
* 4:44 - ""It's something that historically has alarmed us in terms of...we don't necessarily want people in ketosis. It can be very dangerous. Ketone bodies are considered toxic. Your body has two ways of getting rid of them. You either exhale them through your breath or you urinate them out, and so it's a stressful kind of process on your body too because your body is trying to rid itself of these ketone bodies.""
* 5:25 - ""For them (people who've lost weight on keto), they consider that to be, finger quotes, successful, but possibly we're talking two different languages here. Ketosis and those ketones and things--that's some place you want to be health-wise.""",t2_26jdzrp,False,,0,False,The Mayo Clinic discussion of the ketogenic diet,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Science and Media'}]",r/keto,False,6,sci,0,,,False,t3_m0skef,False,dark,0.44,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Science and Media,False,0,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615273114.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.keto,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/VUExZ9FNUCk""&gt;https://youtu.be/VUExZ9FNUCk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Hello everyone. I’m grateful to this community but have yet to post until now. I did very well on Keto my first time around. I lost around 40lbs. I wasn’t exercising but I think I wasn’t eating nearly enough. I wasn’t starving myself at all-but I did feel weak at times. 

I put that weight back on by going off of Keto and doing whatever I wanted for months and on Feb 10th I was 261 lbs. that’s when I went back to Keto. I’m now at 252. Keto is definitely working. But I’m really putting in the work this time by trying to get in 10,000 steps per day and I began lifting two weeks ago. 

The weight is coming off. But there are days that go by with fluctuations. Like I was 3.5 lbs lighter a few days ago but I never eat too many calories and I’m always in ketosis along with being pretty active recently. I get very frustrated. I’m not stopping at all. I think Keto is the best thing for me. 

My question is where do I go to plug in my age, height , weight and activity level to get the firm number of macros I should be shooting for? I put all of my meals into MyFitnessPal daily. But I don’t know what my keto targets should be. My main focus has been to be 2,000 calories or less, to be eating 70-75% fat and to never go over 20 net carbs in a day.

Before keto I had a near insatiable appetite.

I still get a little anxious when my fridge starts to look empty but I’m able to calmly talk through these issues and know I can go to the store whenever I need anything. 

Also I used to eat like a package of burritos in about 2 days and lots of food just in general.

So I've done keto off and on for almost 6 years, not a beginner to say the least. I love experimenting with it and seeing how far I can tweak it to fit my goals.

Lunch: (Post workout) Broccoli and a chicken breast, 300calories. Dinner: Protein shake, 200 calories. I'm hitting my protein macros, but keeping fat relatively low except for eggs and whatever fat I cook with. Haven't had any adverse affects, full of energy and hunger doesn't come to mind even with fats low. 

My main concern is the deficit, I literally do not feel hungry. Has anyone tried this or something similar? SO far it seems sustainable. Even with a huge deficit.

I also live in an apartment, so freezer space is at a minimum. Would love some feedback on where most of you single individuals like to shop at. I&amp;#39;m based in Alberta, Canada just for reference. Thanks. =)&lt;/p&gt;

Low carb tortillas, zerocarb bread, Lily’s chocolate, rebel ice cream, chicken crust pizzas, truvia/cream cheese cheesecakes, atkins candy, sugar alcohols, and all these things you find out about along the way add up and start to be counter productive.

I noticed this morning that it was an odd angle and felt weird  if I let my heel fall into the groove. It was confusing for a moment to me but then it dawned on me: of course it feels weird.

,keto,"I have been obese all of my life since age 5, I wish this way of eating was a normal thing back then. I was addicted to carbs and I simply could not tolerate them. However I try not to dwell on the past and only look forward and am confident I can be the person I always wanted to be.

====

SW: \~146 kg // 321 lbs, M, 28, 5'11

CW: 128.1 kg // 282 lbs

I've tried keto 3 times and failed twice, the third time was truly the charm. I started working out at the gym a month prior doing lower carb just to get my strength up again before going full keto when I knew I would have lower energy levels for a while. Satisfied after a month of some gym progress, I decided to go &lt;20g carbs a day.

The first 5-6 weeks were very hard. I felt like I had to require far more electrolytes than most people, especially if I was working out. I dropped my works out to 1 or 2 times a week because the supplementation required afterwards was not fun for me. But once I got past the 6 week mark I felt pretty good. I'm on the 12th week and I feel like its smooth sailing now. I've been able to start working out again 4/5 times a week as well since I feel like I no longer have to drink tonnes of salt despite eating the same &lt;20g per day since December. I try and aim for 2 meals a day with maybe a snack in between.

Besides bacon and eggs now and then, meals consist of 200-250g of a protein (steak, salmon, chicken etc.) cooked in butter/ghee + salted, with some steamed vegetable or maybe some mushrooms. Snack might be some walnuts, or macadamias (expensive) or quest bar/cookie (also expensive, only get in bulk when on sale), cheese + vegemite/marmite (vitamin b), some liver pate.  I keep it quite simple and I am always satisfied. I don't track carbs with an app, I just make mental notes of any foods with more than 1g of carbs. Tracking with an app may accelerate my progress I think.

**NSVs:**

\- Possible cognitive benefits (memory/concentration?): Picked up piano again after 10-11 years of not playing, and my progress has been astounding. Can almost play an intermediate level song after 3 weeks and almost feel like I'm back to my old level (played from 5-17).

\- While talking about my piano hobby, can see my tendons moving in my hands again. I don't know why but this was a big deal to me.

\- Constant energy, I can whip out of bed and be alert within a minute or two.

\- After the 6 week point I felt much better and had some noticeable strength gains at the gym. Require far less salt supplementation than I did in the first couple of weeks.

\- Pants falling down all the time.

\- Best sleep I've had in 7-8 years, able to fall asleep easily and sleep for longer periods of time.

\- Most importantly, finally hopeful for the future.

,keto,"Hello, long time member but this is my first post.

I've been on keto before and it always worked, from losing weight to feeling better, the whole thing.

Almost a month ago both me and my girlfriend decided to get on keto again and suffice it to say it's not working as expected and we don't know why.

The signs of being in ketosis are there, lower appetite, smelly pee and breath, short term fatigue etc.

But very little weight loss, we both lost about 4 kg 8 lbs in the first week and now zero weight loss for the past 2 weeks.

This hasn't happened before and I really don't know what should change.

We are eating less calories than our normal daily intake, getting between 10-25g carbs a day, fat as needed, enough to be more than protein intake and drinking 2L of water a day.

Is there something I'm missing ? What would be the reasons to have a really slow fat burn even in the beginning ? I've been on keto 2-3 times before and the first 2 weeks were always the ones where I'd lose a lot of weight (even if it was mostly water weight) and then constant weight loss, even if in small increments.

We've also been pretty sedentary since the pandemic and I don't know how much that impacts keto, I wasn't working out or doing anything other than normal day to day things when being on keto in the past either.

,keto,"I started my weight loss journey October last year, started doing keto around the start of November. Each month from November to January I would lose exactly 5kg each month. So I've lost 15kg so far.  But for the last 5-6 weeks I've lost absolutely nothing. It's becoming frustrating and depressing for me. 

I'm trying to work out why I'm no longer losing weight. Since starting keto I have only been calculating carbs to make sure I'm at a maximum under 50g a day, but aiming for under 30g a day. I have not been calculating calories, I've read quite a bit about the keto diet and I haven't seen anyone say you should calculate calories to ensure you're under your calorie limit, is this something I should do? This may make me sound stupid, but what is the point of the keto diet if you're counting calories? Why not just eat 'normal' under the calorie limit? So what benefits does being in ketosis have for weight loss?

I'm trying to think how my eating has changed over the past 2 months to see why I've stopped losing weight, most of all the stuff I've been eating is the same however I think I've started to eat more cheese, I thought cheese was perfect on keto because there is about 1g of carbs per 100g in the cheese I eat, however it is very high in calories, the cheese I've been eating is 400cal per 100g and I've been eating 300-450g a day. (So about 1,200cal a day just in cheese alone, that's a lot)

The other foods I eat are mostly just rump steak, chuck steak, beef mince, chicken thigh, chicken breast, bacon and eggs. In the weight loss calculator it says to maintain weight I can have 3300 calories, to lose about 5kg a month (which I had been doing) I can have 2000 a day. Does this sound about right? I think if I just wipe out the cheese I've been eating (or just eat a really small amount) I should be able to reach that goal.

This is day three of Keto and unless I’m experiencing a full on placebo, I hope I never have to go back to a traditional diet. For the past two years I’ve been experiencing mystery GI Tract problems. I’d always have stomach aches as a kid but after my freshman year of college I knew something else entirely was up. I was in chronic pain, needed to use the restroom twice as often as before, and was woken up day in and day out by stomach aches. I had every test possible conducted seeing multiple Gastroenterologists as well as naturopaths and Cranial Sacral. Only the naturopath detected some irregularity in my gut but nothing that would explain my daily chronic pain. She recommended a gluten and dairy free diet that I’ve been on for the past year. While the diet in combination with intermittent fasting helped, it was only a bandaid on a bigger problem. Fast forward to this Thursday when I decided to try Keto.

Now I’m writing this on Sunday at 10:45 am. I woke up 5 minutes ago free of congestion, full of energy, and most importantly free of the chronic stomach pain that has been plaguing me for the past two years of my life.

Hi all! I get excited to share my progress with you all and it keeps me motivated! I’m super excited to get into ‘onederland’ though I don’t track in pounds haha (I’ve never seen the 80’s range on a scale before, so also excited for that!)

Week 5: 0.5kg
Week 6: 1.1kg
Week 7: 0.2kg
Week 8: 1.2kg

I also had a ‘pause’ at week 3, where I lost 0.2kg (0.4). When looking at the bigger picture, it’s easy to see that weight loss is non linear, and I just have to be patient if the scale doesn’t move much one week, two, or three. 
The weight loss will happen because I am eating at a deficit. I find that being on keto makes it easier to overcome the disappointment of loosing just a little a week, because I don’t feel like I’m depriving myself of anything!

,keto,"I'm one of those people who are on a strict 20gr or less keto diet as a treatment for epilepsy, so please keep that in mind.

I've had a helluva past couple of weeks. I've had explosive diarrhea and EXTREME GI bloating and nothing is abating the symptoms, except Tums™ which I've consumed a bottle.

I have NOT been able to adhere to my keto diet as I've digressed to simple starches as in the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast). NONE of those items are keto friendly.

As a result, I am now having seizures.....so now I'm having to go back on max gabapentin, whose side effect is..... diarrhea. I'm also taking Beano™ before I eat anything.

I'm waiting on a Dr. appt, so I'm not self diagnosing at this point, but going on past experiences. 

Aside from lots of water, any suggestions on diet modifications that are gentle keto friendly so I can transition back to keto while I wait for this appt? I'm exhausted from the lack of sleep and feeling like I shit my insides out.

***Edited to add***: I have MRSA due to a SSI for nearly three years after a double mastectomy with reconstruction. I was on heavy doses of abx for seven months due to NF and when the abx were stopped, I started growing MRSA cysts.

This last year I've been battling cancer and after one of the surgeries my friend MRSA came back and by the time I got to the hospital, I was in septic shock. Heavy duty abx.

As a result, I take a daily probiotic and protein shakes with natural yogurt. I've never had a problem until 2 weeks ago.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a helluva past couple of weeks. I&amp;#39;ve had explosive diarrhea and EXTREME GI bloating and nothing is abating the symptoms, except Tums™ which I&amp;#39;ve consumed a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have NOT been able to adhere to my keto diet as I&amp;#39;ve digressed to simple starches as in the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast). NONE of those items are keto friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I am now having seizures.....so now I&amp;#39;m having to go back on max gabapentin, whose side effect is..... diarrhea. I&amp;#39;m also taking Beano™ before I eat anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m waiting on a Dr. appt, so I&amp;#39;m not self diagnosing at this point, but going on past experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from lots of water, any suggestions on diet modifications that are gentle keto friendly so I can transition back to keto while I wait for this appt? I&amp;#39;m exhausted from the lack of sleep and feeling like I shit my insides out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited to add&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: I have MRSA due to a SSI for nearly three years after a double mastectomy with reconstruction. I was on heavy doses of abx for seven months due to NF and when the abx were stopped, I started growing MRSA cysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last year I&amp;#39;ve been battling cancer and after one of the surgeries my friend MRSA came back and by the time I got to the hospital, I was in septic shock. Heavy duty abx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, I take a daily probiotic and protein shakes with natural yogurt. I&amp;#39;ve never had a problem until 2 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"tl/dr: Did Keto improve/eliminate your BO, and if so, was it a lasting effect? or temporary?

Hi, I've been doing ""clean"" (lots of veg, hq protein, no processed foods) keto (90% of the time) since January 7, 2021. Lost about 23 pounds (M46 6'0"", SW 290, CW 267, GW 220).

I started regular exercise (30-60 minutes bike/rowing 5-6x week, but upper body weights 3x week) a few weeks ago. It was then that I noticed that I no longer have body odor. I don't mean versus the first few weeks of keto, I mean versus the past 30 years. I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this, as I can't find anything about it online - just lots of posts/articles about bad odor on Keto.

What I mean by no BO is that I can put on deodorant (right after showering) and two days later I can still smell the scent of the deodorant, and NO ""sweaty armpit"" smell. (No judgement... we're still in a pandemic.) Even after some of my more strenuous and sweaty workouts I still smell like Arctic Edge for a few hours (until I shower), and I never do develop the ""stinky pits"" scent at all... My pits still do get sweaty, when exercising or in stressful situations, they just don't stink at all now...

My dietary changes weren't really that drastic to do Keto. I have not eaten a lot of ""junk food"" or ""fast food"" for the past 20 years or so (fast food once or twice a year maybe, never anything like doritos, candy bars, etc) just wayyyy too much bread/carbs - and way way too much beer. Also, I am not doing any ""sugar replacement"" or keto-bread/pizza/etc. things - so, not using any keto-friendly sweeteners of any sort or any nut flours,  just lots of green veggies along with butter/olive oil, and proteins (chicken, fish, beef, uncured bacon, etc.), and only 1-2 alcohols/week (red wine, or vodka/rum), instead of 12-20ish beers per week. 

I'm mostly wondering if anyone else has had this happen, and if so, was it permanent, or at least for the duration of being on keto?

,keto,"Hi there.

I have been in an eating habits journey for about a year. Mainly driven by the pandemic and the need to cook more to control my weight.

Meat is my nemesis. Especially red meat of any sorts. I was a vegetarian for about 3 years a while ago, and only switched back because the time required to cook was too much, and vegetarian meals are expensive.

I have been doing CICO with the help of my nutritionist, but time after time I have seen that reducing sugars is key to a sustainable weigh loss and reduce binge-eating situations.

Do you guys know of a meals plan with low sugar and a way to avoid meat?

,keto,"So I was reading through the FaQ and unless I managed to skip over it I didn't specifically see anything stating these things. I am entirely new to macros in general and keto as well. Now ignoring the fact that almost every calculator seems to give me a bit of different answer my questions are these:

The degree of difficulty in sticking to it doesn't concern me as I have a very... interesting living situation and I'm stubborn enough to stick to it regardless.

1. I understand there is a hydration calculator and all that, but assuming my only liquid intake is water can I drink as much as I want? or do I have to limit it?

(I love water. I know it stated electrolytes are important and stay hydrated but will over hydrating impact the process?)

2. if I blend up all my macros that are calculated into one ""shake"" a day, will keto still work?

 (My living situation doesn't allow for much storage of anything and money is difficult, so I was thinking of blending up things that meet my macro into individual meal bottles.) 

(Don't care to get into it but taste as of recently is not an issue for me as I can't taste much anyway. So as gross as it may sound if I have to blend a tuna, asperagus, egg mixture it truly wouldn't bother me.)

3. I get that protein is the goal, fat is to keep you feeling full and fat calculations are more of a limit than a goal, and carbs definitely a limit. but from my understanding I've heard pendulum swings of answers on fat where some say: 

a.) ""Fat doesn't matter that much cause you just want to have more fat than carbs to coax your body into taking the fuel source bait and switching over""

others say:

b.) ""Hitting pretty close to this set amount is very important but don't go over cause that's not good, just try to creep up on it. This is because if you hit your protein, and your fat is low then the body fuels on the protein instead of the fat defeating the purpose.""

if b.) is true.
how low is too low of a fat assuming you hit your protein amount?

here is an example:

1571	kcal Daily Calorie Intake
19	g Carbs (5%, 76 kcal)
130	g Protein (33%, 520 kcal)
108	g Fat (62%, 975 kcal)

Assuming I hit protein, 
what would be the minimum requirement of fat for a macro plan like this? is there a number such as a ""it's good to hit a minimum of X% of fat assuming 100% protein consumption"" ?

Hi keto fam, in honor of my one year of being keto, I just want to write a post to celebrate my on going success and hopefully this will encourage/motivate others.  In January of 2020, I found myself at my highest weight - 182 lbs. which is a lot for my 5’4” frame.  I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and had to sleep with a cpap machine.  In addition, my doctor had to increase my blood pressure medication. I was miserable. I had a toddler I could not keep up with physically and I was always, always tired. So with the new year, I decided enough was enough. I started off low carb to ease myself into the diet. I knew nothing about calories, macros, tracking, what was clean and what wasn’t. I basically ate a lot of protein.  The weight started to drop but after a month, it plateaued. After tons of research, reading, following successful keto people on IG, and watching videos from keto experts, in March of 2020, I started a strict keto diet. I got my macros, and started logging in my food and made sure all my macros were met every single day. I ate very very clean and did not cheat for 6 months straight. 

The hard work paid off and in 7 months, I went from a size 14 to a size 4, a size I had not been since I was 18 years old.  It was a fantasy size I never thought in a million years I would see again. (Note: I lost the weight with no exercise. It was 100% diet. Now that I’m more comfortable with my body, I’ve been incorporating exercise which make me feel so much better.)

Once I got to my lowest weight of 127 lbs, I decided it was time for maintenance. I’ve been on maintenance since August of 2020. I’m currently 130 lbs. and I could not be happier. The lifestyle change wasn’t too hard for me. I get to eat amazing, clean, and satiating foods. I eat a (keto) dessert every day sometimes twice a day. I don’t feel like I’m deprived of anything. My sleep apnea is gone and my blood pressure is so much better. I’ve never been healthier.

It was a fantasy size I never thought in a million years I would see again. (Note: I lost the weight with no exercise. It was 100% diet. Now that I’m more comfortable with my body, I’ve been incorporating exercise which make me feel so much better.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/wlQE5PS""&gt;Highest Weight vs. Lowest Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/jVOzzcO""&gt;Prom Dress Try-on 18 Years Later&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got to my lowest weight of 127 lbs, I decided it was time for maintenance. I’ve been on maintenance since August of 2020. I’m currently 130 lbs. and I could not be happier. The lifestyle change wasn’t too hard for me. I get to eat amazing, clean, and satiating foods. I eat a (keto) dessert every day sometimes twice a day. I don’t feel like I’m deprived of anything. My sleep apnea is gone and my blood pressure is so much better. I’ve never been healthier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I just thought I’d celebrate by writing this post to inspire others and to show them that with hard work, you really can fit into your high school clothes again! 🤣&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Hello, I wanted to see if anyone might have some insight into some issues I’ve been having.

I’m 31, F, 5’5”/165cm, 120lbs/55kg, and Ive been doing keto at 20-25 carbs/day for... years now. Just recently decided to include IF/OMAD into the lifestyle as well.

Only problem is, it makes me sick as a dog after I eat!

I’ve always had a sensitive stomach, though nothing has ever been found medically wrong with me (no gallbladder issues, etc.) Keto has, in the past, eased a lot of these problems, but the last few days have just been miserable. Terrible nausea and sluggishness after my meal.

I eat around 1pm, with a goal of 60-70 protein, &lt;20 carbs, and the rest fat. Normally I’ll have something like 1-2 cups bone broth with hydrolized collagen mixed in, an avocado, and an egg scramble with 4 eggs and some mushroom/kale/cheddar, ending up with a calorie total around 1200. I also make an electrolyte drink with a tsp of Natural Calm, some potassium salt, and pink sea salt. I also sprinkle salt into my water throughout the day, ending up around 3g a day.

Taking a ginger supplement typically seems to calm it all down and ease the nausea, but I am curious if this is just part of the adjustment period (this is only day 3) or if I’m doing something wrong to make myself feel so sick after eating. I was planning on cutting down my caffeine consumption tomorrow from 3 cups of coffee to 2 cups of coffee and seeing if that makes a difference, but I thought in the meantime I’d check in with the Keto subreddit for ideas!

,keto,"Okay so a few months back I tried keto for about a week and a half but I fell off. I already do intermittent fasting but I have a lot going on in my personal life right now with suddenly getting custody of my niece and I’ve never been a mom before. I’m super stressed out but I know I need to focus on my health so I can be around for her and keep being the fun aunt who does stuff with her. 

About a month ago I got down to 208 with IF down from 244.8 in august. I ended up gaining about 15 lbs back due to stress but I want to get back to it and lose more weight and be healthier through keto. 

I could really use some encouraging words, motivation, success stories, and tips and tricks. I’ve just got so much on my plate right now but I know I need to add my health to the plate also. 

As for the chicken in the title, my dad gets tons of cooked and frozen chicken for free from his work and he always gives it to me. So I’ve got about 80-100lbs of cooked chicken in my freezers.

I already do intermittent fasting but I have a lot going on in my personal life right now with suddenly getting custody of my niece and I’ve never been a mom before. I’m super stressed out but I know I need to focus on my health so I can be around for her and keep being the fun aunt who does stuff with her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I got down to 208 with IF down from 244.8 in august. I ended up gaining about 15 lbs back due to stress but I want to get back to it and lose more weight and be healthier through keto. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could really use some encouraging words, motivation, success stories, and tips and tricks. I’ve just got so much on my plate right now but I know I need to add my health to the plate also. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the chicken in the title, my dad gets tons of cooked and frozen chicken for free from his work and he always gives it to me. So I’ve got about 80-100lbs of cooked chicken in my freezers. Some is breaded (which I won’t eat), some are strips, some are breasts.

,keto,"Hello,

I need some help understanding why I am failing on Keto... again..

I am no keto newbie. I have tried over the years quite a few times to adhere to the diet. I started my journey again about 3 weeks ago and everything was going great! Within my first two weeks I dropped 8 lbs, my meter was always between 2.8-3.7 - I was so excited!

Then comes week 3. I start my week off with a hike, excited to see what is in store for the changes in my body this week! Then.. nothing.. I haven't even shed an ounce.

I get on the scale this morning and I have GAINED weight. I haven't changed the diet from the first 2 weeks. Last night my meter reading was 2.7. This is a typical day for me as far as menu:

**Morning**

Black Cold Brew Coffee with a little heavy cream

**Lunch**

Hard boiled egg and a 1/2 of Good Culture Cottage Cheese with 1carb French dressing (Sometimes I swap out the cottage cheese for half an avocado)

**Dinner**

Cheddar sausages with peppers and onions

or

Steak/chicken or pork chop with roasted low carb veggies

**Snacks**

On the rare occasion that I snack I usually eat a couple garlic jalapeno stuffed olives, sometimes I eat 10-15 Whisps, sun flowers seeds or rarely a couple small pieces of cheese.

I only drink water, coffee, occasional sugar free red bull and some vodka mixed with club soda.

Also I eat between 18-20carbs/day

I feel like I'm losing my mind over here. I have been trying to lose my baby weight for almost 10 years and nothing has been successful for me. Keto is the only thing that fit with my lifestyle that has shown SOME results, but I ALWAYS end up stalling on the weight loss after the initial drop and I don't understand why. I have researched and researched and just can't seem to find the answers, so I'm hoping someone here can help with with their expertise/experience.

If you read this I really appreciate you taking the time and I wish you luck and positivity on your journey and if any of you are willing to share some wisdom I would welcome it with open arms.

,keto,"I started Keto a little over 6 months ago, and have lost 17.4kg/38.3lbs during that time. Weight loss has been steady, and I've allowed myself to cheat (within reason and limits) for special occasions.

I'm extremely proud of myself and am happy with my progress so far.

I have 11.5kg/25.4lbs to go to reach my initial desired weight of 75kg/165lbs.

I started doing intermittent fasting about 1 month ago to boos my weight loss (and it helped with a slight bump in weight loss) and then started exercising (light interval training for 20min a day). My fasting is 16-8 which I am comfortable with, and I can only do light exercise due to a brain condition (the exercise which I already do sometimes leaves me KO from pain).

I am now picking up and losing the same 300g day to day for the last two weeks, and this has not yet happened on my keto journey. I know one needs to have patience and celebrate non-scale wins, but I still get a little frustrated.

I'm looking for anecdotal advice from others of a ""tweak"" they have done in their keto journey that helped give a boost when progress was slow or they were plateauing. For example, cutting out a certain item or so (just a random example).

Thanks so much!

Tasty things I eat on some days:

Exercise:

**Edited to add my response to a comment below re: carbs/caloric intake:**

My daily carb intake is usually between 5 and 10 grams, but essentially I keep it to under 17 grams max. Calories typically max out at around 1000 but sometimes as high as 1100 or 1200. That said, I don't exercise much apart from my walks and I am currently working a desk job from home, so I don't expend a lot of energy. I'm also therefore not that hungry – I've gotten used to eating small snacks throughout the day and not really sitting down to three square meals like I used to pre-Keto.

,keto,"*EDIT: More accurate title: Husband isn’t losing weight as quickly as anticipated and feels stalled.*

Hi,  everyone. Trying to help a guy out here! He’s asked me to reach out.

I did keto a few years back and lost about 10 lbs during my first month. My husband’s been on keto now for 4 weeks, and has bounced around with the same 5 lbs. 

Before that, for about 4 weeks, he was just counting calories, but having the same experience, which is why he switched to keto, to see if limiting carbs would be helpful to him (both for weight and energy) as he’d seen me and others have success with it. 

To boot, he also quit drinking completely around the start of the year. He was consuming on average anywhere from 500-1200 calories of beer per night. He wanted to get sober for obvious reasons, however he’d also heard of people dropping weight like mad after quitting drinking and has been disappointed that it hasn’t happened for him. 

He exercises a minimum of 4x/week, doing push-ups and walking about an hour on the treadmill with some light jogging. 

He is getting so discouraged with his weight loss or lack thereof. 

Two main theories he has right now about the slow speed of his weight loss: 

-keto “breads” (ie. those low-carb tortillas or loaves of bread from the store, which he eats about once a day or so) 

-keto sweets (He’s always had a sweet tooth so having keto sweets was important to him. I make him things like peanut butter fat bombs, and he often grabs himself a spoonful of peanut or almond butter here and there. He has keto ice cream he enjoys and sugar-free hard candies as well. He quit vaping this year too so the sugar free hard candies and sugar free gum help keep his mouth busy. In general he has maybe 2-3 sweets a day, such as a fat bomb, a keto ice cream, and a couple hard sugar-free candies.)

He’s probably gonna take a break from these things for a day or two to see what happens, but in the meantime, what are your experiences with this? 

He just figured that quitting drinking completely, cutting his carbs, and exercising would result in a quicker drop, since he’s seen that happen in so many people. He knows every body is different, but of course it’s always helpful to double-check with a community. :)

*EDIT (again): I provided his stats in a comment and it sounds like it would be helpful to post here too, so here they are.

“He’s bouncing between 220 and 225. He’s 5’11 and just turned 33. He’s using a food scale. He checked his food-logging app and said he’s been netting 1000-1600 (netting, as in these are calorie totals after exercising) but says he generally sticks to 1500-1600 cals a day even when he exercises. Fat/day averages 100grams and protein is average 100grams. Carbs are averaging 20-25/day.”*",t2_4fu2x9ro,False,,0,False,Husband isn’t losing weight on keto.

&lt;p&gt;Are there any ways you have all dealt with this? It is frustrating feeling like people are rooting for me to fail just to prove a point.&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"I started keto on January 4th, 2021. 24f, about 5’3, and my starting weight was 170. During quarantine, i got depressed, and when I stepped on the scale in December I was so disheartened. I am SO glad that I channeled that negativity into bettering myself. 

I fell off the wagon for a week. I live in Texas and when the winter storm hit, I was at my partner’s. We got hit pretty hard and so we could not go anywhere. We had to eat what we had (which was mostly pasta and rice based dishes) Prior to this, I had lost ten pounds. I felt like I had probably gained back everything I already lost, and decided not to weigh myself for a couple of weeks and just get back on keto. 

Today, I had a really hard day at work, and almost had a cheat meal. Literally drove to the drive thru, waited in line, felt too much pre-guilt and drove off. Then tonight I was thinking “would it even matter, I feel like I haven’t lost anything.” I couldn’t help it and weighed myself (I shouldn’t weight at night, I know) I was fully prepared to step on the scale and realize I was back where I started. I couldn’t believe it when I saw 155! I literally started dancing and singing We like to Party by Vengaboys lmfao.

I know it’s not the most dramatic of success stories, but it has really made me want to keep going and I’m so happy I didn’t cheat today. Anyways, I really wanted to tell someone :)

,keto,"Hey all,

This may be TMI, but I feel like we are a family here. I started keto a little before 2021. Then added IF, eating at a 40% deficit while strength training for 30 minutes and 30 minutes of cardio every morning but Sunday. I am 30 lbs down (188lbs to 158lbs) and below my original goal weight.

Looking for a bit of advice.
I lost 2 stone 6 months ago switching to a KETo lifestyle and really enjoy eating KEto.

In an attempt to get fitter I now do an hour and a half exercise every day (run,cross train, weights, row) and my weight isn’t dropping like I’d have hoped.

I seem to be fluctuating up and down a pound each week. 
I’ve been doing workouts since Christmas so I’m hopeful that the muscle mass is now built and I am more toned in appearance but I need to tackle the weight.

Any ideas for those who are doing both? Can I sneak a banana in after workout? Is Keto even a good match for this level of exercise or am I better with low fat?

Any ideas lovely people?!

,keto,"Well I’m a little over a month in and I’m down 14lbs total. I hit a little bit of a plateau for about a week but weight is on the move down again.

The biggest changes I can see are not on the scale as usual- I can already tell a difference in the mirror and in my clothes, which is encouraging! 

One thing that’s different with Keto from when I started out in 2018 is that there are now so many more keto-friendly foods on the market. I know many here are against substitutes for things like sweets or bread, but they help me stay in ketosis and not just give up altogether (yay Quevos and the Enlightened Keto line!).

NGL, when I’m having a grief day I want sweets and being able to do it in a way that doesn’t take much  effort and doesn’t throw me off track on ketosis is awesome. 

I do check my blood ketones daily as a way to keep my mind on track, but it does also help me identify things that I thought were ok (like White Claw) that lower my ketones and risk knocking me out of ketosis. I know it’s not a necessary thing to do but it helps my motivation and routine.

,keto,"The [London Telegraph reports](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/03/uks-covid-death-toll-fuelled-obesity-epidemic-say-experts/) that a study of 100 countries by the World Obesity Federation found that 2.2 million of 2.5 million deaths occurred in countries with high levels of obesity.

The study noted that death rates were discovered to be **10 times higher** in nations where more than 50% the population was overweight. 

According to the study, in countries without obesity problems, the death rate from the virus was no higher than 10 per 100,000 population.

***“We now know that an overweight population is the next pandemic waiting to happen,”*** noted Dr Tim Lobstein, the author of the report, senior policy adviser to the World Obesity Federation and visiting professor at the University of Sydney.

Britain, which has the third highest COVID death rate in the world, also has fourth highest obesity rate. On the flip side, Vietnam has one of the lowest levels of obesity in the world, and also has the lowest COVID death rate.

The new study backs up findings from *Lancet* published research last year which noted that obesity [increases the risk of death from Covid-19 by around 50 per cent](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/obesity-fuelling-covid-19-deaths-britain-globally-lancet-disease/).

The findings have prompted stark warnings from the World Health Organisation, with Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general noting ***“This report must act as a wake-up call to governments globally.

,keto,"Hi I was considering quitting keto because I'd been getting palpitations that made me too worried to continue, but in a last ditch effort to make sure I'm getting all my electrolytes (because I'd been trying to just get them all through my diet) I bought magnesium citrate pills.

I've just taken them and within 20 mins my palpitations have stopped, and I have a tangy metallic taste in my mouth. I'm not sure if this is a placebo effect, 20 mins doesn't even seem like enough time for the pill to fully dissolve and reach my bloodstream. But it is a pill without a coating so maybe it could be that fast. Has anyone else had that response to magnesium citrate? 

I had been taking about 3-4 mg of salt a day in a glass of water, spread throughout the day (ironic as I went keto to lower salt levels I was consuming) and that made no difference.

But I'm not sure if I should be taking a potassium supplement too? I've read a lot of people of here talking about lite salt, but here in the UK it doesn't seem we can get that. And I've read warnings about potassium supplements. But I know for a fact I don't consume anywhere near the daily amount, I have less than 1000mg per day and that is a struggle.. the volumes of food I would have to eat to get between 3000-4000mg would be ridiculous.

,keto,"Hey guys, this is my first time posting. I started the keto diet in June of 2020, and stayed consistent with it since I was desperate to lose weight. Combined with weight training and bike rides multiple times a week, I lost 22 pounds in 2 and a half months and gained plenty of confidence since, even though I still overweight, I was able to fit into my clothes more comfortably and reaching my goal seemed in reach. 

When I started my junior year of high school, I ended the diet since I became too stressed out with school and became eating impulsively late at night, usually ordering fast food and other unhealthy crap. I gained the weight back and more, making my current clothes a lot tighter than before I even started the diet In June. I want to get back on the diet but it’s so hard given that school and the SAT’s are stressful and my first impulse is to eat, along with the fact that my family isn’t the best when it comes to nutrition and often makes/orders unhealthy food, tempting me to eat it with them. 

I apologize for the block of text but I thought that context would help better, but my question is how do I stay consistent with my keto diet despite urges to eat when stressed and bad influences around me tempting me to eat junk food?

Combined with weight training and bike rides multiple times a week, I lost 22 pounds in 2 and a half months and gained plenty of confidence since, even though I still overweight, I was able to fit into my clothes more comfortably and reaching my goal seemed in reach. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my junior year of high school, I ended the diet since I became too stressed out with school and became eating impulsively late at night, usually ordering fast food and other unhealthy crap. I gained the weight back and more, making my current clothes a lot tighter than before I even started the diet In June. I want to get back on the diet but it’s so hard given that school and the SAT’s are stressful and my first impulse is to eat, along with the fact that my family isn’t the best when it comes to nutrition and often makes/orders unhealthy food, tempting me to eat it with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the block of text but I thought that context would help better, but my question is how do I stay consistent with my keto diet despite urges to eat when stressed and bad influences around me tempting me to eat junk food? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR- lost weight on keto diet last summer, gained it back and some more due to stress from school and negative influences, need help on getting back on the diet and staying consistent with its&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Hi- 70 y.o. F, 5'5"",SW 228#, CW 204#, GW 160 ish

I've been on keto and fasting anywhere from 16:8 to 20:4 with a couple of 40-hr fasts thrown in. 

I'll pose my question first and fill in background at the end. 

Q: Will increasing protein help me return to super-woman status? Or is it something else?

After about the first week of this regimen, I felt better than I have in years. Mental clarity, mood, energy level through the roof. At about 6 or 7 weeks in, these effects seemed to wane a bit. After 10 weeks now, I still have tons more energy than before but am starting to notice a return of sleepiness after eating and am occasionally napping again which I used to do on a daily basis when I was a carb-eating-machine. I have lost that feeling of elation I first experienced.

Previously was on a mostly pescatarian diet- lots of fruit &amp; veggies, beans, fish &amp; seafood, home-made breads and PASTA with junk snacking after dinner.

I am tracking on Carb Manager. I never 'cheat' (like eat potato chips or pie) and don't eat outside of an 8 hour or less window, but sometimes I do get lazy with my tracking. I usually have trouble eating my allotment of calories but I won't eat if I'm not hungry- I hate feeling stuffed. I rarely exceed my carbs or calories but have had trouble getting all my protein.  I just got a protein powder so I'm hoping that will change.

I am currently 20, and I weigh at least 115kg. That's around 18 stone. I have always been heavy but right now is the heaviest I have ever been, and truth be told - I'm sick of it.

,keto,"Hi everyone! I’ve been lurking this sub since I officially started keto and have loved seeing everyone’s hard work paying off. 

I’ve always had an active lifestyle but my diet was undisciplined until September 2020. I come from a Hispanic and Italian background, and if you know anything about those two cultures when it comes to food you know that it is basically anti-keto when it comes to carbs and sugar. Last year was particularly challenging - a bad break up and two sudden deaths in my family topped with financial instability. I tell you this because I tend to be an emotional eater, so that was a huge factor of my overindulgent/careless behavior last year. I turned to comfort foods to make myself feel better and it was starting to get out of control. 

I finally had enough.

I never even thought twice about changing my diet until a good friend of mine suggested I try keto. I decided to commit and I’ve honestly never felt better...

My family is supportive and have all noticed a big shift in my mood, confidence and overall appearance. It took me longer to notice my own physical progress but I knew this lifestyle change was actually making me feel good from the inside out so I just kept up with it. 

I wish I had a before picture but didn’t think it would  matter at the time...if you haven’t done so already, take progress pics now! You’ll be blown away. KCKO

,keto,"I’ve posted before but I guess this is more like a formal introduction. Prior to covid, I’d been working out like a maniac and hit all my personal bests. I got up to 205 lbs as my high and I was pretty muscular, especially for that weight and only being 5’8”. Long story short, I haven’t been able to hit the gym and while I hadn’t gained weight, I watched my body get squishy.

Flash forward to 2 Fridays ago and I decided to start Keto on a whim. I’d already been doing IF during the week and that helped me not gain weight but I wasn’t losing any. So I combined IF with Keto and within two weeks I’ve lost 20 lbs. Last time I did Keto it took about 4 weeks to lose this weight. This time around has been much easier than the last.

Ultimately I’m already halfway to my weight goal. I’d love to get down to 165 then come back up to 175 but with muscular growth, not fat. 

This diet has worked wonders for me. Kicking energy drinks was easy and having the two cheat days on the weekend kills my sugar cravings during the week. Honestly I can’t wait to eat keto foods by Sunday night lol.

I can’t wait to finally get back to a comfortable weight and begin loving myself in the mirror again.

,keto,"Hi all,

I've started keto on 2/4, it is now 3/4 and NOTHING lost. I've been tracking my macros (under 20 net carbs/day; \~90g protein and 100-110 fat), I'm at a 1400 cal deficit, and taking measurements weekly.

Started at 158.8, now at 157.4 after a month. I did Whole30 the month prior (January 4-February 4) to acclimate to lowering my processed carb intake, but was living on apples and bananas. I lost 10lbs in that month. I thought cutting out those carby fruits and foods that got me through w30  and doing the keto switch would bring me those amazing results everyone says about how the weight just ""falls off"".

I work a desk job, so I don't frequently exercise, and I really. need to be better about drinking water. But otherwise, I'm following the meal aspect pretty rigidly. I am usually hitting 20g net carbs each day, and hitting my protein goal daily. I never usually hit the fat goal, but I make sure its higher than the carb count.

I've had a 1-2 cm loss in my waist measurement which is encouraging, but my problem area is my thighs and those haven't budged. Neither has the scale. Should i be doing the OMAD trend? 

I have a history of ED and I try to avoid overly restrictive diets, so OMAD seems a little triggering and I'm hesitant to fast a lot... but is fasting the key to the dramatic results?

,keto,"https://ibb.co/twf7XLT (bought a renpho scale half way through my weight loss)

I’m 33, 6 ft, 250 pounds

I’m not at my goal yet. Will post before/after pics after I reach my goal.

I was in good shape prior to meeting my wife: https://ibb.co/4R753PN however after living together for years and having a kid my diet went down the gutter. I was still moderately active and could run/lift: https://ibb.co/Fb9NjMB however I had to stop going to the gym due to covid.

My weight exploded. I was 6 ft, 350 pounds on October 22nd and I knew I had to make a change. I started with just Keto. Then added omad. Then alternate day fasts. I have been able break my diet for short vacations without repercussions. My weight balloons for a week then falls. It’s all water.

I’m currently a medical student and recently had a lecture from a bariatric surgeon about how all diets ultimately are statistically the same with regards to weight loss. He recommended that someone with my former BMI would be able to reach a normal weight via surgery. 

I feel like keto is different and it’s possible for large weight loss with this diet (I know it’s a personal anecdote) - I don’t experience hunger. I’ve tested this to 72 hour fasts and I feel fine.

I have no underlying medical conditions and I make sure to get blood work regularly and my electrolytes/albumin fell about 2 months in so I upped the protein, lowered the fat (switched from ribeye steaks to chicken breast) and supplemented with more ketoaid and the issue fixed itself.

I didn’t think it would be possible to lose weight this quickly. I just wanted to thank this community for all the information that is readily available for people like me.

The one negative I would say is that I’ve lost a lot of muscle. I doubt I could bench even 2 plates atm.

,keto,"I recently read **The Case for Keto** by Gary Taubes and it was extremely eye-opening.  It became my new bible or big book or whatever.  I realized how bad I needed to do this WOE - because of my carb addiction.

My carb addiction was causing my insatiable hunger and food cravings. My food cravings were causing UNCONTROLLABLE eating and poor habits.  I would get up out of bed feeling hungry and go shove my face full of crackers just so I could lie down and sleep.

This book helped me understand that it's not my fault - *I'm not weak-willed*.  I needed to break the carb-feed-carb cycle and thus quit the foods that my glucose and insulin were addicted to feeding off of.  Being on keto has done this for me. I am able to stay full and satisfied without judgment or shame for 5 hours between meals now.  It's a miracle.

""And you don't cure an addiction with moderation; you do it with abstinence"" - page 181.

""With diabetes and obesity, your body is essentially a sugar or carbohydrate addict. Telling our patients to moderate intake is telling them to do something that is almost physiologically impossible and keeps the addiction alive.  What we're fighting against is the concept of moderation. It doesn't work."" - page 181.

,keto,"Hi guys,  


I have a tough time losing weight when I eat carbs. I've been following a 40c/40p/20f diet for the last 2 months but I haven't lost 1 pound! My weight fluctuates between 224 and 229 lbs. I had a blood test recently and my doctor said I was not insulin resistant. I don't have diabetes or pre-diabetes. He told me I had high cholesterol though. 

Why am I posting this in the keto section? When I did keto (actually it was the carnivore diet)  back in 2018 I lost 54 pounds in 16 weeks. The weight just melted away. It was so easy to lose weight.  


Has anyone else been in this same boat? ie You're not insulin resistant but can't lose weight when you eat say 150-200g of carbs a day? If so, why do you think that is?

,keto,"I started going to the doctor's office in September to see about weight loss.  I was feeling so heavy and unable to do much.  At the end of November I hit a horrid number.  I was at 480 lbs.  I was just so angry at myself, so deflated.   The weight loss clinic suggested Keto, which I started on December 8th.  I am very fortunate that my wife decided to do it with me.  We really only eat Keto in our house now, but we cook rice and pasta for the kids.  (We usually just go without pasta or use cauliflower rice and cabbage for rice).   I just crept under 440 today, and I feel amazing.

I don't know if it's the lack of gluten, or the glucosamine that I'm taking, but my knees feel fantastic.  I think it's the lack of gluten, which I would have just scoffed at before. All I know is my knees haven't felt this good in over a decade.  I couldn't get off the ground without a crutch or something of some kind.  This isn't a problem anymore.

I have ZERO carb cravings, even for popcorn (my biggest weakness).  My kids can have it near me and I don't care.  (In fact, I don't eat all the snacks anymore, which they used to have to hide from me.)

I really felt out of control back in November.  Right now, I'm feeling amazing, and I can see where I am headed.  I'm losing an average of 2 pounds a week, which is a good rate for me.  I still can't really see it in my body quite yet, because honestly I stopped upsizing my clothes a few years ago.  

My wife has lost many sizes as well. (I don't want to put from what to what  because that's just rude).

I want to go back because even healthy carbs like potatoes make my stormach hurt and i am so terribly bloated but this study scares me because it is not your usuall ”40% carbs” junk epidemiology but a study where they acually where on keto. 

The question is this though : was it just maybe one kid in one of the groups trowing of the data maybe? 
They didn’t seem to say that the arteries where stiffer but just that they where markers of it. 


Some might say that since it is a theraputic keto diet it is not relevant to nutritional ketosis , and i Don’t think being in ketosis on its own would cause stiffer arteries , but maybe they where eating a lot of some fat , it would be interesting to see which one.

,keto,"Been on Keto a little less than a month. I dropped 17 pounds! I was so excited as I deal with PCOS and I’ve been bigger most of my adult life. I cried because I’ve never been able to lose any type of weight. Recently though I’ve been on a slow weight gain. My lowest so far has been 229 and now I’m 232*. I know it may not seem as much but it sucks. I dealt with an eating disorder in middle and highschool and finally got over it and then started gaining rapidly and couldn’t lose then was diagnosed. I count carbs and give myself a 20carb limit but I really just eye things. I’ve been working out and doing cardio Sunday and Monday and weight training the rest of the days. I work all day and go to school full time so it’s really hard to fit in the work outs. I heard that you lose the water weight at the beginning and that’s what the big steep drop is. I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for me. I’ve been on a plateau for about 1.5 weeks now and small bit steadily growing. My thoughts on what could work:

1. Really counting carbs and limiting them mostly all together or trying 15 carbs. Although TMI I’ve been not passing any number 2s. 
2. Getting off Keto for a week and then trying again? 
3. Get more cardio in vs weights 
4. Just helps please lol

I dropped 17 pounds! I was so excited as I deal with PCOS and I’ve been bigger most of my adult life. I cried because I’ve never been able to lose any type of weight. Recently though I’ve been on a slow weight gain. My lowest so far has been 229 and now I’m 232*. I know it may not seem as much but it sucks. I dealt with an eating disorder in middle and highschool and finally got over it and then started gaining rapidly and couldn’t lose then was diagnosed. I count carbs and give myself a 20carb limit but I really just eye things. I’ve been working out and doing cardio Sunday and Monday and weight training the rest of the days. I work all day and go to school full time so it’s really hard to fit in the work outs. I heard that you lose the water weight at the beginning and that’s what the big steep drop is. I’m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for me. I’ve been on a plateau for about 1.5 weeks now and small bit steadily growing. My thoughts on what could work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really counting carbs and limiting them mostly all together or trying 15 carbs. Although TMI I’ve been not passing any number 2s. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting off Keto for a week and then trying again? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get more cardio in vs weights &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just helps please lol&lt;/li&gt;

,keto,"Hi all,

This is my second time doing keto. First was during a 12-day retreat (9 days of keto, 3 days fasting). Now I am about month in with a ""cheat weekend"" that I regret. (I felt much worse in my body and didn't enjoy the cheating as much as I thought I would.) I weigh about 75kg, down about 3kg a month ago. I spiked to nearly my pre-keto weight on the Monday after the cheat weekend and by Friday I am only 1kg off. I am guessing that I lost about 1.8kg of water weight and about 200g of fat and/or possibly muscle (a guess based on CICO).

Several years ago I was able to complete a week-long cycling trip with hilly terrain. I started out able to ride 15 miles the first day (and hating it) to being able to ride 45 miles or so on the last day. That was probably my best cardiovascular fitness. I am now riding 5 times a week on an indoor trainer using /r/Zwift. I am ramping up my exercise intensity gradually. Now I am doing about an hour to an hour and a half on the bike 5x a week, mostly in zone 4 heart rates. My goal is to check off Zwift's hardest route—173km and 2496m—in 3 months. I'll be patient with myself and listen to my body.

I am currently targeting a 500-calorie/day deficit so I can lose what I think is a conservative 1 lb/week. I would also like to improve my cardiovascular fitness. I am limiting carbohydrates from 20–25g daily and intermittent fast for 16–18 hours daily. I have a tendency to go over with the protein and under with the fat, so I plan to learn how to eat less meat and switch to higher fat/protein ratio foods such as high-fat dairy, 100% MCT oil, seeds, etc. I live in a place that has very good quality meat, fish, and dairy.

As I ramp my exercise from about 2 hours a day 5 days a week to possibly more than double that as I pursue this challenge (the later rides will entail upwards of 6 hours at relatively high intensity), I'm beginning to wonder if the standard macro formula will work. I am currently using my average Active Energy and Resting Energy stats to adjust total caloric intake and my macro calculations (using [keto.app](https://keto.app)'s formula but with a lower carb goal).

,keto,"Hey everyone I’m looking for some help/advice I’m feeling really down. 

Last May I started with Keto I did a 28 day cycle,a 2 week IF keto and then started maintenance(25 day). My first 2 weeks I went down 7kg. But then that was all the scales budged for the rest of my time with this. That was pretty upsetting but I saw major changes in my body so I was ok with it. And then thankfully after I finished maintenance I was able to keep my weight steady at 97kg. I took a few months off  started another cycle in September but only  lost 4kg, and didn’t see much changes in my body. And my weight wasn’t as steady as the first time. Stayed low carb low cal after that cycle and now here I am again, with 1 week left of my 28 day cycle and only 1.5kg down...and not much body change.. i drink A LOT of water 128 oz not including any black coffee or tea one thing is I’m not running to the bathroom to pee as much as the first cycle. Also not as regular with #2 as I used to be...  I  know I’m not over eating can I be under eating? Definitely not too much protien or carbs staying under 20 gr every day. I haven’t had much appetite at all this month i may have sabotaged myself by not eating as much as I should but what else could be the problem I’m just feeling so defeated.. I just wanted to lose a couple more Kgs and would have been happy but now I’m just stressing. I just placed an order for Ketochow and I’m going to pick up some MCT oil as well. And try that. 

I had a plan made out for me which had my macros at 20g carbs 125g fat and 75g protien which had my calories around 1200. All of my food is weighed out!

,keto,"About me; 32m, 6’5”, SW: 503 CW: 484 GW: 280 Lean Body: 270 - On keto for a 1.5 weeks this time

I was on keto with 2-3 fasting days a week for 6 months 2 years ago and lost 170lbs but gained much of it back after a bad living situation and worse choices.  I’ve been back on since Tuesday of last week, cut out all added sugar, no more diet Dr Pepper, I only drink water and the occasional Bang. Here’s my issue, my TDEE is estimated at 4475 calories (which I know is not 100%) and from the damnripped calculator, a 50% daily calorie intake is 2237, which is way too high for me to eat. In fact between the appetite suppression from keto, and the appetite suppression from my ADHD meds, I’m averaging about 8-15 grams of carbs and my calorie tracker (I track everything and eat simply so it’s easier to track) averages about 1100-1300 calories per day. The problem is I’ve tried eating more and I’m just not hungry. I drink at least 1 full gallon of water per day and I think that helps keep me sated. Should I drink less?

,keto," Hi,

So I am very keen to incorporate bone broth to my routine as it has so many wonderful minerals. I tried beef bones and chicken feet and both put me off, I don't know...it was just too intense for me. I barely eat chicken and fish in my diet, I don't like beef and pork maybe that's why. 

We do eat chicken wings quite often so I was wondering if I should use the wings instead.
The questions are will the wings produce as much quality as the chicken feet would? Also after baking them in the oven for quite a bit, would it still yield good quality broth?

,keto,"I have been a long, long time lurker.

I am 40/F, 5'4"" and have been on keto for two weeks as of yesterday, coming off a diet 90% fast food.

I do OMAD and have three meals I prep and rotate (one chicken, one seafood, one beef).

When I started I weight 151lbs and my use the Keto app, which calculated my macros at:

1189 calories
103 grams of fat
15 grams of carbs
51 grams of protein.

I made my OMAD meals within 5-10 grams of this, and always under with carbs and calories. I also walk 5K a day, and do NOT include that in my macros (ie: I don't eat more).

The first week, Wednesday to Wednesday, I weighed in and went from 151 to 142 (water weight, I know). But then, eating the exact same foods and exercising the same way the next week, when I weighed myself yeterday I was at 147 and I feel suuuper bloated and my clothes are fitting more snug.

I read up online and saw that bloating can happen as your body adjusts to the fibre, but that usually happens during the first week.

Otherwise, I feel incredible, but I'm just confused about the weight thing (it's also not shark week, I know that can change things.)

,keto,"One of my heart’s secret desires is to get a tattoo on the inside of my right arm. I have had this dream for a long, long time, but have been so hesitant because it’s a nerdy tattoo. I don’t mind being a nerd with a nerd tattoo, but I never wanted to end up a fat nerd with a nerd tattoo, so I’ve never gotten around to it.

I’ve been doing keto for a few weeks now, have been feeling good, haven’t slipped once, and have been seeing real results! While I don’t want to reward myself *now*, since I know it’s WAY too early, I would like to at some point, and I would love for that to be my tattoo.

They wreck my stomach, making me a gassy bloated mess. I know some of you will preach that cutting out sugar will help adjusting tastebuds, but I really enjoy baked goods. Plus, it would be nice to not try to kid myself that baked goods using that nonsense even tastes good when I know I’ll be hurting within an hour after eating them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I found out about Bocha Sweet. Has anyone tried it? If so, can you chime in on how it compares to erythritol or any swerve/lakanto kind of sweetener that includes erythritol? I specifically want to know if it causes stomach upset. And if you know of ANY sweetener that doesn’t cause stomach upset, please share! I’m willing to try if it’s worth a shot at baking again and not feeling like crap afterwards. Thanks!!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; ## Abstract
&gt; 
&gt; In the past three decades, total fat and saturated fat intake as a percentage of total calories has continuously decreased in Western diets, while the intake of omega-6 fatty acid increased and the omega-3 fatty acid decreased, resulting in a large increase in the omega-6/omega-3 ratio from 1:1 during evolution to 20:1 today or even higher. This change in the composition of fatty acids parallels a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Experimental studies have suggested that omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids elicit divergent effects on body fat gain through mechanisms of adipogenesis, browning of adipose tissue, lipid homeostasis, brain-gut-adipose tissue axis, and most importantly systemic inflammation. Prospective studies clearly show an increase in the risk of obesity as the level of omega-6 fatty acids and the omega-6/omega-3 ratio increase in red blood cell (RBC) membrane phospholipids, whereas high omega-3 RBC membrane phospholipids decrease the risk of obesity. Recent studies in humans show that in addition to absolute amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid intake, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio plays an important role in increasing the development of obesity via both AA eicosanoid metabolites and hyperactivity of the cannabinoid system, which can be reversed with increased intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is important for health and in the prevention and management of obesity. [View Full-Text](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/8/3/128/htm)

&gt;
&gt; ## 6. Conclusions and Recommendations
&gt; 
&gt; -   Human beings evolved on a diet that was balanced in the omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids.
&gt;     
&gt; -   A high omega-6 fatty acid intake and a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio are associated with weight gain in both animal and human studies, whereas a high omega-3 fatty acid intake decreases the risk for weight gain. Lowering the LA/ALA ratio in animals prevents overweight and obesity.
&gt;     
&gt; -   Omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids compete for their biosynthetic enzymes and because they have distinct physiological and metabolic properties, their balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio is a critical factor for health throughout the life cycle.
&gt;     
&gt; -   Adipose tissue is the main peripheral target organ handling fatty acids, and AA is required for adipocyte differentiation (adipogenesis). The increased LA and AA content of foods has been accompanied by a significant increase in the AA/EPA + DHA ratio within adipose tissue, leading to increased production in AA metabolites, PGI2 which stimulates white adipogenesis and PGF2α which inhibits the browning process, whereas increased consumption of EPA and DHA leads to adipose tissue homeostasis through adipose tissue loss and increased mitochondrial biogenesis.
&gt;     
&gt; -   High omega-6 fatty acid intake leads to hyperactivity of endocannabinoid system, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lead to normal homeostasis (decrease hyperactivity).
&gt;     
&gt; -   High omega-6 fatty acids increase leptin resistance and insulin resistance, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lead to homeostasis and weight loss.
&gt;     
&gt; -   Because a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio is associated with overweight/obesity, whereas a balanced ratio decreases obesity and weight gain, it is essential that every effort is made to decrease the omega-6 fatty acids in the diet, while increasing the omega-3 fatty acid intake. This can be accomplished by (1) changing dietary vegetable oils high in omega-6 fatty acids (corn oil, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils) to oils high in omega-3s (flax, perilla, chia, rapeseed), and high in monounsaturated oils such as olive oil, macadamia nut oil, hazelnut oil, or the new high monounsaturated sunflower oil; and (2) increasing fish intake to 2–3 times per week, while decreasing meat intake.
&gt;     
&gt; -   In clinical investigations and intervention trials it is essential that the background diet is precisely defined in terms of the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acid content. Because the final concentrations of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are determined by both dietary intake and endogenous metabolism, it is essential that in all clinical investigations and intervention trials the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are precisely determined in the red blood cell membrane phospholipids. In severe obesity drugs and bariatric surgery have been part of treatment.
&gt;     
&gt; -   The risk allele rs 1421085 T to C SNV in intron 1 and 2 in the FTO gene functioned similarly to AA metabolites, PGI2 and PGF2a increasing proliferation of white adipose tissue and decreasing its browning respectively, whereas the knockdown of IRX3 and IRX5 genes functioned similarly to omega-3 fatty acid metabolites increasing the browning of white adipose tissue, mitochondrial biogenesis, and thermogenesis. Therefore, further research should include studies on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in blocking the effects of the risk allele (rs 1421085), which appears to be responsible for the association between the first intron of FTO gene and obesity in humans.
&gt;     
&gt; -   In the future studies on genetic variants from GWAS will provide opportunities to precisely treat and prevent obesity by both nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions.
&gt;     
&gt; 
&gt; Obesity is a preventable disease that can be treated through proper diet and exercise. A balanced omega-6/omega-3 ratio 1–2/1 is one of the most important dietary factors in the prevention of obesity, along with physical activity. A lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio should be considered in the management of obesity.

I was able to maintain that 220lb to 230lb range up until about this time in 2019. Since 2019 I have gained \~45lbs and my food intake hasn't really changed.

Does your body adjust over time to where keto is no longer as effective? Has anyone else experienced this?

Would it benefit at all to completely stop keto for a few weeks or a month and then restart?

&amp;#x200B;

The picture on the left was taken on the beach in Lima, Peru, around October of 2019. December 25th of 2019 is when began following keto strictly. My last update was roughly 8 months ago, and I was taking keto a lot more seriously at that time. Weighing most foods, trying not to surpass 25 net carbs per day, and routine fasting were a huge part of my life. These days, I'm on dirty keto. I'm a little sloppy with the carb counting, I reach for the food replacements a little more than I should (low carb tortillas, rebel creamery, quest snacks, etc), and I cheat probably once every two weeks - and when I say cheat, I go a little off the rails for the day.

When I started this journey at the end of 2019,, I landed on a arbitrary number - 175. I'm a little bummed I never made it, but I can say I've broken my addiction to snacking, binging, and making poor food choices. I am able to slip back into a strict version of keto/fasting with no problem, coming off of a cheat day. I know this is a slippery slope for a lot of people, and I feel grateful to be able to say this, but I finally feel like I beat an addiction to carbs and sugar. It feels good to not be afraid of food anymore. It feels good to be able to eat something I know isn't good for me, and realize I can stop at one piece, slice, bag, etc. I don't have to devour everything in sight in excess. Discipline is what I lacked, and I still do in a few areas of my life, but no longer with food. It is liberating, and it's a sense of freedom I've never known with something I clearly struggled with.

,keto,"Hello everyone, 
Last summer (2019) i’ve lost around 10 kg on keto in about a month, which was pretty amazing. 
However, because of the stress about COVID and work (also, the lockdown didn’t help) i’ve regained much more than i’ve lost. So, for the last month i’ve been back on keto and so far no results... 

I’m 1m71cm (5’7) and 100kg (220 pounds) at the moment.

I’m eating around 130grams of fat, 70g of protein and 6g of net carbs. Also doing intermittent fasting and some physical activity. 

I’m feeling pretty good, not hungry, no cravings, so it kind of shocks me that there is no progress so far. 

Also eating clean keto, with the only exception of cheese. I’m thinking of cutting it to see if it helps, but I have no idea where to get my calories from otherwise.

As for working out, I was three weeks into the workout program when I started this WOE. I noticed a small loss of energy and stamina in the 1st week( I do cardio/weightlifting in a fasted state) but now that I’m fat adapted I have no problem with my workouts!

,keto," 

I have some tolerance issues with  eggs. But I find mayo/hollandaise sauces make keto so much better and  easier to do. I'd swear the fats are easier to digest from those emulsion fat sauces. 

So I wanted to  figure out how to make an eggless sauce. I searched online, found some recipes. But from comments, and the few recipes I tried, they weren't like a real mayo/hollandaise/bernaise sauce. Wrong consistency, flavor wasn't right, mouthfeel not smooth/creamy but more gloppy/gel-like, how it 'rests' on food or reacts to being used as a dip wasn't right either.  Even the emulsification didn't seem to be right. I noticed with eggs the taste of olive oil remains, but the acidity/tingly is reduced and you get a 'smoothness'. But with the 'eggless' versions, the acidity/tingly remains. 

Eventually, just through making observations of cooking over  time, I figured something out. I'm not sure how to share the my 'discovery' though. 

The sauce I've  learned to make is creamier and richer than mayo and hollandaise, can be  emulsified with water to get the right consistency, works exceeding  well with a reduction for added flavor, does not require an acid allowing a wider range of flavor profile, does not have any raw products, has more depth of flavor than eggs provide (if you tried other  eggless recipes you know they can be bland by comparison, this one is  big on the background flavor)...  
I think what I've found really is superior. It's  also easier to make to some extent. There's no need for double boilers or complicated temperature control to prevent egg curdles, and the sauce doesn't 'break' as easily as hollandaise/mayo. 

One drawback is it requires  some more prep. But even that prep is not really a 'new or additional task'. Think of it more like the  difference between boiling a potato and just eating it as it, versus  boiling it and then mashing them down. It doesn't take much more effort  or time, you just have to plan things out differently.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't find any mention of making sauces using this cooking technique on the internet. I find it hard to believe no one else knows about it, but that's what seems to be the case. So, I'm not sure if I should publish it myself on a  website, or sell it to someone with a 'keto food blog', but it seems like I might want to be careful and do more digging.

So part of figuring things out is seeking feedback from other people on a HFLC/ketogenic diet.

,keto,"Hi, my girlfriend is a t1 diabetic, and we've recently started doing keto + intermittent fasting. It has only been a couple of days but she managed to reduce her amount of bolus (mealtime) insulin units to 4, which is great. Her basal (dripping) insulin was at 33 yesterday and we hope that will go down in time as well. (Considering her regular daily total amount was at 50-60s just last week, it's great progress) We mainly started this for weight loss, but hope to stay doing it for the long term cause it's great for her a1c as well. 

My confusion is this: I follow Dr. Eric Berg and other sources and I've read that even tiny amounts of insulin in the blood can take you out of fat burning, so for people without t1 diabetes, they suggest fasting and low carb, but since a t1 diabetic needs the constant stream of dripping basal insulin all day long, does that mean they won't be able to go into fat burning mode even though they are doing keto + if? Or does dripping insulin doesn't effect it that much?

My girlfriend uses a pump for her insulin, she doesn't use different types of insulin for mealtime and dripping, she sets it on the pump and the same type on insulin is injected as basal, and after the meals she manually sets how much she needs and that's her bolus.

,keto,"Hello r/Keto! 

I've  been quietly doing low-carb for a few months now and recently added a 16:8 IF/TRE to the mix and have been loving it so far! Recently I had my annual check up and was kinda surprised by how high my LDL-C  and total cholesterol got. It got me worried enough that i thought of getting a Coronary Artery Score, but apparently for my age it would not show anything anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past two years I've eaten healthier and healthier but my LDL-C and total cholesterol has been increasing. (Although my all-important HDL/TG Ratio is great, more on that below). My GP believes its Hypercholesterolemia because of the trend, and wants me on 10mg statin. I'm not 100% comfortable taking the statin as T2 diabetes runs in my mothers side, and although my glucose has never been an issue (even when i was fatter) and my weight is down, I don't want anything to push it in the wrong direction. (as well as the other possible side effects of a statin). 

&amp;#x200B;

There may be a family history of FH on my moms side, but it's hard to tell as ALL the family members that have had heart disease had T2D! My grandpa on my moms side has ""high cholesterol"" but he's 87, never had heart disease, SMOKES, and is doing just fine other than A-Fib (which is common at that age and he's healthy enough to get the corrective surgery!)

&amp;#x200B;

In late 2019 I discovered through an allergy test I have celiac disease. it was later confirmed by endoscopy biopsy. This is what eventually led me to the low-carb diet. I'm not sure if there is any causation/correlation between celiac disease and total/LDL cholesterol levels but it seems lo have gone up since the diagnosis.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets get to the numbers! I have records all the way back to 2015

&amp;#x200B;

10/27/15 (I was 100% Plant Based during this test)

&amp;#x200B;

Total: 182

TG: 62

HDL: 48

VLDL: 12

LDL: 122

TG/HDL Ratio: 1.0

&amp;#x200B;

3/24/2017 (This year I was drinking more beer, eating more crap and not plant based)

&amp;#x200B;

Total: 260

TG: 86

HDL: 52

VLDL: 17

LDL: 191

TG/HDL Ratio: 1.8

&amp;#x200B;

5/11/2018 (This year I also was a heavy beer drinker but with less junk food, but after this I started getting it together)

&amp;#x200B;

Total:209

TG: 98

HDL: 41

VLDL: 20

LDL: 148

TG/HDL Ratio: 1.9

&amp;#x200B;

1/11/2019 (This is the first test after starting to eat a lot better and basically quitting beer)

&amp;#x200B;

Total: 193

TG: 53

HDL: 55

VLDL: 11

LDL: 127

TG/HDL Ratio: 1.3

&amp;#x200B;

2/18/20 (This is the first test after my celiac diagnosis. After this I doubled down on eating better) (Also this is new DR and doesn't list the VLDL for whatever reason)

&amp;#x200B;

Total: 216

TG: 59

HDL: 49

NON HDL: 167

LDL: 152

TG/HDL Ratio: 1.2

&amp;#x200B;

2/24/21 (This is the most recent and concerning one as both my total and LDL-C jumped up and is the reason my GP thinks it's FH and prescribed a low dose statin)

&amp;#x200B;

Total: 268

TG: 66

HDL: 55

NON HDL: 213

LDL: 196

TG/HDL Ratio: 1.2

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've read on here, the Cholesterol Code, and other sources; the main number to look for is the TG/HDL Ratio which got a lot better! My GP made no mention of this ratio and jumped straight to a statin.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my questions are; Is this uptick of Total/LDL-C consistent with FH? Does celiac have an effect on cholesterol even when following a gluten-free diet? Is there other tests I should ask for, and do  I really need to keep taking a statin when my TG/HDL ratio is nowhere near a heart disease risk?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or insight would be much appreciated.

&lt;p&gt;1/11/2019 (This is the first test after starting to eat a lot better and basically quitting beer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total: 193&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TG: 53&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HDL: 55&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VLDL: 11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LDL: 127&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TG/HDL Ratio: 1.3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/18/20 (This is the first test after my celiac diagnosis. After this I doubled down on eating better) (Also this is new DR and doesn&amp;#39;t list the VLDL for whatever reason)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total: 216&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TG: 59&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HDL: 49&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NON HDL: 167&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LDL: 152&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TG/HDL Ratio: 1.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/24/21 (This is the most recent and concerning one as both my total and LDL-C jumped up and is the reason my GP thinks it&amp;#39;s FH and prescribed a low dose statin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total: 268&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TG: 66&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HDL: 55&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NON HDL: 213&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LDL: 196&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TG/HDL Ratio: 1.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I&amp;#39;ve read on here, the Cholesterol Code, and other sources; the main number to look for is the TG/HDL Ratio which got a lot better! My GP made no mention of this ratio and jumped straight to a statin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess my questions are; Is this uptick of Total/LDL-C consistent with FH? Does celiac have an effect on cholesterol even when following a gluten-free diet? Is there other tests I should ask for, and do  I really need to keep taking a statin when my TG/HDL ratio is nowhere near a heart disease risk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help or insight would be much appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

Hello! I’ve been doing keto since Jan 4th and have recently started adding in working out at the gym as well. I’m wondering if there’s any adjustments I need to do to my macros/calories I’m consuming? The scale isn’t moving anymore even at a calorie deficit and working out three times a week. 

Right now my calorie allowance is 1300, 20g or less carbs, 75g protein, and 115g fats (I don’t normally hit my fats completely).

,keto,"I am around 5'9 and I started Keto in October at about 230 pounds.  I haven't weighed myself in a while, but last time I checked I was at 185.

Anyway, my weight loss had slowed down for a while so in February I ordered some clothes that were 36/30 and a mix of medium and larges. I was in shock when they fit, even though I measured myself before ordering them.

Then, right before the winter storm hit Texas, I ordered some aspirational 34/30 pants. One pair of pants to try on when the scale wasn't showing weight loss. A pair of pants to work towards and keep me going.

Anyway, they were delayed because of the storm and arrived today.

And they fit. Like, they looked good. 

The 45 pounds is great, but this means I've lost about 6 inches in my waist in a few months and my next goal is 32 inches in the waist and not 34.

Keto is working for me. Every once in a while I see someone post they lost X amount in Y time and get a little disheartened if it is more than I have, but I'm realizing it is different for everyone and we all just have to keep trucking on.

This is now my 5/6 time doing keto.  I tend to get to my GW or near it then gradually go back to my former carb lifestyle then cycle back once i see the scale heading the wrong way.  I think this time I am going to keep it going,  add a little more calories and actually try to lift weights as well.  My advise for those thinking about trying keto is make sure you drink plenty of water and electrolytes your first week,  this has always helped me immensely getting thru the Keto flu,  and in fact this go around I didn't even have any negative side effects.

,keto,"Granted, I still get cravings from time to time, but I’m enjoying the process so far. My diet has consisted of eggs with butter or coconut oil, cheeses, beef, broccoli, avocados, sardines, Brazil and macadamia nuts, cheese, and keto-friendly yogurt. Keeping it simple so far. Been also supplementing with mct oil mixed in with buttered coffee. I also take Creatine for my workout sessions.

I feel like I’m able to be more creative with my dishes as opposed to the other diets I’ve tried in the past. At the cost of lowering my carbs to about 20g or lower, I honestly feel like I can do without foods like white rice and bread. It’s still an adjustment process, but I feel it paying off day by day. 

I also intend to combine keto with intermittent fasting.

Pros so far:
- Clearer skin
- Slimmer waistline (lost about 10lbs)
- Mental clarity
- Discipline 

Cons:
- Slight fatigue
- Lackluster workouts 
- Some insomnia 
- Agitation from time to time

Been also supplementing with mct oil mixed in with buttered coffee. I also take Creatine for my workout sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I’m able to be more creative with my dishes as opposed to the other diets I’ve tried in the past. At the cost of lowering my carbs to about 20g or lower, I honestly feel like I can do without foods like white rice and bread. It’s still an adjustment process, but I feel it paying off day by day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also intend to combine keto with intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros so far:
- Clearer skin
- Slimmer waistline (lost about 10lbs)
- Mental clarity
- Discipline &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons:
- Slight fatigue
- Lackluster workouts 
- Some insomnia 
- Agitation from time to time&lt;/p&gt;

Hi! Started keto adventure a month ago - with starting weight 97kg (213lbs/15 stone). 
I however seem to be losing weight very slowly. 

First week I have lost 2kg (which I’m assuming could be water weight) but now the weight seems to be stalling (last week -0.25kg). 

I use Carb Manager App if anyone with some experience would like to take a look and tell me where I’m going wrong? 😊

The best advice I can give to people trying to lose weight and trying to keep it off is to ask them how do they want to live their life?

,keto,"1. Actually started cutting out gluten and sugar at the on 1/28 and keeping carbs low, but not tracking them, on 2/20.  On 2/24 started keto in full and using the Chronometer app.
2. When I started cutting out gluten, after a few days I noticed my knee joints didn't ache.
3. When I started tracking with Chronometer app, SW was 201.  This morning I weighed in at 193.  That is 8 pounds gone, and even if it was water weight, I have always had a struggle.
4. Donated blood.  My local blood bank measures your cholesterol and reports that to you.  Last time in December my cholesterol level was 222.  This time it was 181.
5. I have had success in the past with Weight Watchers but found it both tiresome and expensive.  Plus, after reading up on keto and carbs in general, I realize that for a lot of people telling them fruits, including bananas, are ""zero points"" is a recipe for disaster, as well as giving low points to things like ""fat free"" stuff.   And it was hard not to be hungry all the time.  Now?  I'm not hungry.
6. I have A1C levels that I need to watch, and I don't want to develop Type 2 diabetes and wind up on medication.  I realize that like it or not, for someone like me, carbs make me bloated, cause me to break out, gives me heartburn . . . and crave more carbs.
7. I will be 60 on my next birthday, so I have had a lifetime of eating things that were not the best for me.  That means adapting to a new way of eating is not so bad.  In fact, bread now to me is somewhat boring - I would rather appreciate the filling for the sandwich.    That being said, I like Aldi's L'Oven bread as a handy sandwich ""holder"" and I like the slight, sweet-ish flavor of coconut flour for a 90-second mug keto bread - the latter reminds me of savory cornbread (I live in the South and cornbread is usually not sweetened like a cake because it is meant to accompany things like BBQ and beans).
8. Who says I can't have some ground beef and cabbage sauteed in a pan for breakfast?  That is one thing I have going for me, I have never thought that any meal ""has to"" be something because it is breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
9. Kerrygold butter from Ireland is wonderful.
10. Tried a bulletproof coffee today because I wanted a cup of coffee on my way home from photographing a proposal (I'm a photographer).  I found it . . . meh.  I might order it again if I pass by that coffee kiosk in the future, but a regular cup of coffee and a buttered 90-second keto biscuit on a rainy afternoon is a nice treat at my desk.
11. If you have a Kroger brand grocery store near you, check out when they discount packaged salads (the ones with the ""woo-hoo"" stickers.  A lot of them are kale, brussel sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage instead of lettuce.  Toss out the pre-packaged dressing and other things and use the greens for stir fry (or a salad but I like stir fry better).",t2_3itcd,False,,0,False,Day 7 - My Observations,[],r/keto,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_lwbrsx,False,dark,0.91,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1614745899.0,text,6,,,text,self.keto,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

,keto,"I wanted to follow up a post I made three weeks ago. My Dad joined me on keto and has been steadily and healthily losing weight since new year. So far he’s down 30lbs, he loves the lifestyle and he’s not had a drink since new year either. Family were sceptical, and outright objectionable following my Dad’s minor stroke three weeks ago. 

In a follow up appointment, my Dad’s doctors were nothing short of astonished, he’s making a great recovery and not only that, his health is the best it’s been in years. And he has reversed his type 2  diabetes! The doctors have told him to stick with keto and said everything he’s doing is absolutely the right way forward. Family are now so on board they are virtually claiming credit for his lifestyle change. My Dad and I find this hugely entertaining!

About two months ago something happened. I am not sure what, but something changed. I randomly decided to step on a scale and realized I'd somehow lost a decent amount of weight.

But it took so long I'd get discouraged in the 180s. When I stepped on the scale, I was in the 180s already and something just sort of clicked. I just decided I was ready, I guess. 

What I find interesting, and something I didn't notice right at the time was that my attitude has been completely different this time.

I’m curious to know the ideas and opinions you all have.

As you all know, your appetite can and often will go way down when fat adapted. 

My question is:

When one meal of let’s say 700 cals plus a 100 cal coffee fills you up and you have zero desire to eat more, should you force yourself to ensure you come in at a minimum recommended cals?? 
Or
Because you’re fat adapted and your body is using fat stores for energy, it’s not a big deal that you’re under minimum calorie recommendation? 

I’d love to know your ideas.

,keto,"(23F 176cm/5’9)

A month ago I did a body scan through F45 and got 17.9% body fat and weighed 65kg/143lbs. 

I started keto a few days prior to the scan and focused on hitting my macros for the next month (&lt; 20 net carbs etc). I’m pretty active, hitting 20k steps most days and attending F45 classes 5-6 days a week. 

I didn’t really worry about calories, I just wanted to get used to the lifestyle and foods. With that said, I just ate until satiated with some days indulging in more. 

It’s been a month and I did an update body scan to see how I was going on keto. My body fat was exactly the same, 17.9% but I gained fat (~400g) and muscle (~1.5kg). Overall, I gained about 3kg (6.6lbs)- from 65 to 68kg. 

Im obviously stoked about gaining muscle but really wanted to decrease my body fat %. Aesthetically I can see I’m softer as well. 

Would tracking and cutting down my calories to 1500 a day strictly but still following keto be the solution to this? I really wanted to follow something maintainable long term where I wasn’t thinking about calories constantly (hence why keto)

Perhaps the lack of energy in the transitional stage of eating carbs to keto meant I didn’t work out as hard?

I can’t sleep. I’m tired (exhausted) but I can’t sleep. I’m up until 3am ish most nights then up with the baby around 6am. This is really killing me and making it difficult to loose weight. 

Any insights? I used to be a bad insomniac so I am not napping (napping is the worst thing for chronic insomnia), have good sleep habits (no phone in the bedroom, no screen directly before going to bed, cool comfortable room, etc). Given that I’ve been using my sleep routine for ten years to address the insomnia and it suddenly isn’t working makes me think it might be keto?

,keto,"Hey all. Ive been lurking around the forum for the longest and its helped so much. Ive been meaning to join and make a post for the first time so here we go.

I guess you can call this a success story although lately ive been stalled and feeling up and down in terms of health. ( Please let me know if you guys would like to hear about what brought me here )

The short story: Last February I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I weighed 410lbs. My A1C was 10.7. I started Keto in the middle of March right about the same time covid started getting really bad. Since then I've lost 125lbs and my A1C is now 5.6. It seems crazy to say it and I still dont beleive it somedays but my fat pants tell the truth everytime I'm wearing them and I have to pull them up. 

I accomplished this by just dietary changes alone averaging roughly 20 - 30 carbs per day. I've had this irrational fear of physical activity for the longest time which fueled my lack of movement as well as the stay at home quarantine. 

During the journey I had a few health scares that could have possibly been attributed to lack of electrolytes however I've had about 5 blood panels completed since I started and my doctor never advised that they were low/ high. 

One of the scariest things that happened was a couple of months ago when I had this very strange aching pain in my left arm, left jaw, chin, and left side of my chest. My doctor chocked this up to gastrointestinal pain and ordered an ultrasound which showed that I have gall stones but no blockages. The pain has come and gone a few times now and when I have one of these attacks it lasts for weeks at a time. My cholesterol has also creeped up and it was normal before I started. Not blaming keto but im not sure why its gone up.

Recently my chest/arm pain has been at bay but now a new thing thats been happening is this dull aching pain at the back of my head, below the hair line which sometimes causes me very short headaches. (Few seconds at a time) I think this area is where the occipital lymph nodes are based on google-md.

My doctor says it's most likely muscle strain as I have a desk job and stare at a screen most of the day. My gut/ anxiety is telling me it could be something else as ive never experienced pain like this before. Its been going on for a few weeks now and im at a loss. 

I've been feeling pretty bummed about my health otherwise, even though I know I should be proud with how much weight I've lost. The random scary pains keep taking away any feeling of accomplishment that I should have and keep reminding me im not out of the woods yet. And to top it of, I've hit the longest stall that I've had since starting keto last year and have basically gained and lost the same 5 - 8 lbs over the month of February. Im still trying to KCKO but the health concerns really suck for my mental state. Im all for any input/questions!",t2_8myyig2b,False,,0,False,Bittersweet feelings after 1 year on Keto.

Anyways, ive been reading up on electrolytes and other things, I have been drinking water, powerade, even mixing some salt in my drinks at times. I also bought on Amazon some keto electrolyte suppliments, but nothing seems to be working and I dont know why.

The trouble is I feel like I have been through a car accident and wake up the next day soreness. mainly in my back area. sometimes if I move my arms or back/muscles around, ill get these sharp pains that shoot.

my muscles still feel severely fatigued when I get up to do anything, so I cant really exercise yet. However, they dont feel as fatigued as they were when I started 5 weeks ago. At least now I can talk and hold my mouth open without feeling jaw fatigue.

But... the extreme muscle soreness doesn't really want to go away. And I don't understand why or what I am doing wrong. I also had a high ferritin level which I did a blood donation to help alleviate that, and will have to give another one in a couple of months.

,keto,"(32/F/5'4/187) So like the title says, my husband and I are starting keto and this is his first time. I did keto pretty consistently for about 8 months and I felt incredible and lost a good amount of weight. But quarantine stress eating definitely brought me back a few steps.

Now, I'm pretty solid with keto meals and how your body goes into ketosis and generally how it all works, but I'm really struggling to figure out what meals to make for us because he is a pretty picky eater. I'll likely have to adjust the meals I'd make for myself and just not include the things he doesn't like. That doesn't sound too bad, I mean I made modifications to the meals before so that it was keto for myself, but now I'm trying to come up with meal ideas that will not dishearten him and make him want to quit.

So here's the deal, he doesn't like cheese or really dairy in general; so no cheese, cream cheese, heavy cream (or creamy dishes), no sour cream, etc. But there are so many meals that are centered around baking with cheese, and adding it as fat, etc. Not a fan of pickles or olives, so that's not really a good snack option, and he's not interested in taking electrolytes (hopefully I can sway him on that since they're so vital). He also doesn't really like cauliflower rice, at least he tried it, but didn't like it and it's doubtful he'll want to try it again. He'd rather just not have it at that point. Thankfully he's mostly fine with vegetables and he's a big meat eater, but beyond a meat and sautéed veggies every night, it means meals are going to be boring and repetitive and maybe not with enough fat to keep him satiated or may be not filling enough. 

It's already a stretch that he's trying keto, and it's very likely he's going to quit, but I really want to try to encourage him and make the meals as enticing as possible. Any ideas for meals or ways to add fat for him? He does like avocado, butter, and nuts, so that's a good start but may not be enough. Don't really know how open he'd be to trying fat bombs, but I have a feeling the texture and the keto sweeteners would be a turn off.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s already a stretch that he&amp;#39;s trying keto, and it&amp;#39;s very likely he&amp;#39;s going to quit, but I really want to try to encourage him and make the meals as enticing as possible. Any ideas for meals or ways to add fat for him? He does like avocado, butter, and nuts, so that&amp;#39;s a good start but may not be enough. Don&amp;#39;t really know how open he&amp;#39;d be to trying fat bombs, but I have a feeling the texture and the keto sweeteners would be a turn off. And now you see my dilemma, any advice?!&lt;/p&gt;

Quarantine led me to being the heaviest I’ve been in my life. I’ve always tried to not get out of control with my eating so I’ve never been obese per say, but I was eating burgers and pizza nearly everyday because I was upset at the world. Still working on being an emotional eater. 

Eventually I started to be able to grab on parts of flab that didn’t exist on my body before, my clothes were grabbing on some parts it never did.

The most I’ve ever lost in my life. It may not sound like a lot, but as a short woman it’s been incredibly hard but I’m proud of where I’ve come so far ! Still a lot to lose. 

Anyway, so during quarantine one thing that made me the most insecure were these rolls I would get on my back on my sides, whenever I slightly leaned to the side or pushed my shoulders back they’d appear. I hated them so much. I always liked how I looked in a tight t-shirt cause all my gained weight would be waist down. It was the only part of my body that gave me confidence. But not anymore.

,keto,"I’m a 34/m, and I started keto — more or less — right at the beginning of last September. I was hovering right around 250 lbs, having packed on about 70 since I graduated from college back in 2010. 

In the summer of 2019, I suffered a stroke (caused by a neck injury, but I wouldn’t doubt my unhealthiness contributed to some degree). During my time in the hospital, they also said I needed a sleep study because, during the night, my blood oxygen levels were getting too low. Long story short — and I’m sure you know the answer here — I had sleep apnea. The ol’ one-two punch (tho, to be fair, apnea was a little lower on the “oh shit” scale than the stroke). But lemme tell you, that kinda stuff definitely puts life in perspective; I decided I wanted to not only maximize the quantity of life, but the quality as well. Following that, I managed to knock off a whopping 10 lbs — 260 down to 250 — but then just...nothing else happened.

So another year passes and I’m still stuck at 250, and I finally decide it’s time for a *real* change. My wife and I had dabbled on keto in the past, but usually didn’t last longer than a month. This time was gonna be different.

Since it’s the first of March, I figured we’ll call today 6 months of being on keto. I’ve pretty consistently lost about 2 lbs per week. On August 25th, I had a weigh-in for a health screening and I was 253 lbs. This morning I stepped on the scale and was 202 and change. I went from obese to overweight, and although I haven’t been retested, my snoring has drastically decreased and I awaken feeling more refreshed. Sooooo glad I finally stuck with it. And, bonus, I just had a physical last Wednesday and my labs all came back normal (blood pressure and cholesterol are still up in the air as I’m still on meds for those, but the docs have decreased some of the dosages so even that’s a plus).

So the moral of the story: keto does work if you’re diligent. Also, don’t wait for something to break before you make the change; it’s easier to maintain than it is to fix.

,keto,"So I am 23 F, 5’ 7”, 180 lbs. GW: 145. 

Summer of 2019 I gained weight rapidly (about thirty pounds in 2-3 months) and was tired, losing hair, major brain fog, cold all the time, etc. Went to a not awesome doctor who told me to just take antidepressants. Fast forward to August 2020 and I’m getting ovarian cysts, gyno does bloodwork and find out I have hypothyroidism. I have been taking 75mcg of Levothyroxine since the beginning of February, was on 50 before that. I am also pretty anemic and have been taking an iron supplement since that time.

The weight still has not come off with thyroid treatment or going to the gym (I started being pretty active around December when I felt I had a bit more energy once again) and decided to try keto with the encouragement and advice of my endocrinologist.

I’m two weeks in and haven’t had a single movement. I have read the FAQ’s and I am tracking everything. Right now I am eating 1,500 calories a day, 20 (sometimes 25) grams of carbs, 92 grams of protein (I almost always hit this), and 115 grams of fat (I have never hit this goal). This is based off the Keto calorie calculator in the FAQs. I get enough electrolytes and drink a ton of water. I also take a multivitamin, vitamin D, and vitamin B by the request of my doctor and vitamin deficiencies.

Idk I just haven’t felt any different nor has the scale or tape measure moved at all. I’m getting my thyroid levels checked again Wednesday but last time I got them done they were within range but not ideal (hence why I went up in dosage).

Any tips or advice?

,keto,"I’ve tried keto several times, the longest I’ve made it was 3 weeks then I decided awh, I’ve been good I can have one cheat meal, then that cheat meal has caused me to spiral out of control then eventually completely forget about keto all together.

Last year for a little while before COVID happened I started to workout with friends and was doing pretty good, I got down to 332 then once COVID shutdown the gym I just spiraled out of control just eating whatever I want sometimes that would be damn near a whole dozen of doughnuts from Krispy cream. On top of that I’m a truck driver so my activity is virtually non existent. I had gotten new work shirts that I couldn’t even wear because they were so tight, I ended up buying new jeans that eventually I had to unbutton while driving because they were too tight for such a long drive.

When I decided to start keto mid January I was 370 my heaviest that I’ve ever been. I decided to start again since my parents started keto. (They are down 30-40lbs each themselves!!)

Since then today I stepped on the scale, I am currently 326.8!!!!! Down over 40lbs! The work shirts that I had gotten fit, those pants I bought fall off me if I don’t wear a belt. I have never gone this long on keto and it’s amazing to me, I’ve thought about cheating but I don’t have a craving to do so. I have developed a whole new mind set without even initially intending to do so. I have felt my confidence grow drastically. What’s even better is since I wear a warm big Carhart(I live in Colorado) been growing out my beard and since we have to wear masks I feel no one has really noticed.  So when the summer months come around I start to shed the layers, I feel like it’s going to be a coming out party with my weight loss, since I have not told anyone until now how well I’ve been doing! 

I cannot wait as well to get my physical this year in July since it will be the first time in a while I won’t have to stress out when I go to get it!

So when the summer months come around I start to shed the layers, I feel like it’s going to be a coming out party with my weight loss, since I have not told anyone until now how well I’ve been doing! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot wait as well to get my physical this year in July since it will be the first time in a while I won’t have to stress out when I go to get it! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!! Here is to future me, when I look back at this post and I’m under 300 the first time I saw a 2 in front since high school!&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday, after many months of long conversations, confusing emotions, and pain, my best friend and person I would spend the rest of my life with, rejected me. 

I've not only lost the potential to be with the woman I love. But I may have lost my greatest friend I've ever had. 

Everytime I've failed to stick to this way of eating, one I firmly believe is the right way for me, it was using food as a coping mechanism. The last year I've been sorting out mental health issues I've had my entire life, and I attribute my current success to that. 

Words cannot express the grief and hurt I feel. The metronome of my heart ticks from numbness to abject sorrow. 

But, at least I'm not using food like a junkie. I feel no desire to numb the pain with sugar. If anything I'm more motivated to hit goals so I can get a fleeting taste of positive emotion.

,keto,"I know a lot of you guys keep it secret that you’re doing keto but how do you get away with it when you’re living with family and someone else cooks for you?

I’m a college student currently away for school right now so I can fully control what I eat. But when I go home for the summer, my mom is going to be doing a lot of the cooking and I don’t know if I should tell her I went keto. (I am planning to cook as much as I can but I’ll also be working a 9-5 job and my family eats around 4:30pm sooo). 

I was already lazy low carb for 6 months prior to keto (aka no white processed carbs, sugar, etc) but that was already a huge adjustment for me and my family. I cut out 90% of my old diet and even rice, our staple food. It was hard but not too bad because all I had to do was avoid the carb part of the meal. Now that I’m keto and actually tracking carbs, I realize how many carbs are in EVERYTHING, and it feels impossible to avoid without at least letting my mom, the main cook, know and being an active part of the cooking process. 

How do you guys deal with home cooking? My mom knows I’m low carb and I told her I feel better this way and it’s for my PCOS, so she respects it despite being worried for my health (I’m 20F/5’6/116lbs) and occasionally forcing me to eat complex grains like farro. She adjusted her cooking so we don’t eat much bread or noodle/pasta based dishes anymore (aka she makes sure there’s always something for me to eat), and she started buying keto snacks and baking using monkfruit and almond flour, but this is a totally different ballgame. This would involve micromanaging ingredients and weighing them while she cooks, and tagging along on as many grocery trips as possible, lol.

,keto,"Here is the journey of carbs in our body in a large perspective

1. Carbs are break down to glucose

2. Glucose is offered to cells

3. Cells accept whatever they need and reject the surplus

4. Whatever that is not absorbed by cells is traveling to liver

5. Liver stores some of the surplus glucose as glycogen for consuming in near future

6. Glycogen storage is very limited. Once it is full then liver starts converting glucose to lipid and send them out to lipid cells

7. Lipids are saved in lipid cell and this makes us a bit fat

8. In some stage lipid cells cannot accept more lipid then they start to reject them

9. Now liver has no option except saving the produced lipid in its cells or distribute it in the blood. This ends up fatty liver and high trygliciride in your blood test

10. Once liver is fatty enough it refuses to accept more glucose hence glucose can not find a home. Homeless glucose find its way to blood and to organs like eyes, etc.

,keto,"A normal meringue is whipped egg whites stabilized with an acid and a metric poopton of sugar. They can be made keto friendly by substituting the sugar for another sweetener such as allulose or erythritol. If you use pasteurized eggs or carton egg whites you can consume it raw and there is no danger of salmonella poisoning. If you're a volume eater you've found your jam because 100 grams of egg whites will whip up into a huge bowl of fluff that is only 52 calories, 10.9g protein and 0.7g net carbs.


First, why not just use whipping cream? The answer is cream is loaded with fat and it's very calorie dense. Yes, I know fat is not too be feared on keto, but sometimes you just can't spare the calories. Plus some people are avoiding dairy. Egg whites have no fat.


Let's talk eggs. Pasteurization changes the makeup of the whites and some brands whip easier than others. I've had the most success with the Walmart house brand Great Value. The Costco Kirkland brand was a complete failure for me. Dried egg white powders also work, but reconstituting them with the right amount of water can be tricky.


Use a hand or stand mixer with a wire whisk attachment and a glass or stainless steel mixing bowl. Plastic bowls can hold grease which will prevent the whites from whipping. It's very important to wash the whisk and bowl before starting even if they are clean. Airborne grease can float around and settle onto surfaces, so wash everything with dish soap and rinse well.

I usually make 100g of whites at a time measured by weight, so the ratios given here are for that amount. You can play around with the amounts. Unlike meringue used in recipes this is very forgiving as long as you have clean tools and follow a few basic steps.


Measure your egg whites and let them come to room temperature to get the most volume. If you're in a hurry you can just whip them right from the fridge, they just won't rise as high. Add a pinch of cream of tartar or a small amount of lemon juice and beat on slow speed until the whites start to foam. Add your sweetener a little at a time (I usually use Lakanto granulated and start with half a tablespoon) and increase the speed. The whites will take on a smooth, shiny appearance. Whip until the whites reach the soft peak stage, then you can taste for sweetness to see if you need to add more sweetener and add your flavoring.


Vanilla extract is the old standby, but there is a huge variety of baking and candy making flavors that work great. Basically anything that is not an oil or has an oil base. Oil will deflate your meringue. You can buy them from Amazon, vape suppliers, hobby shops and baking/candy making suppliers. These are very powerful and since you're not cooking the meringue they don't bake out so little goes a long way. Just a few drops will usually do it. Some of my favorite flavors: butter pecan, butter vanilla, raspberry, peach and kiwi.


Whip until everything is incorporated and enjoy immediately. I eat it right from the bowl.

&lt;p&gt;First, why not just use whipping cream? The answer is cream is loaded with fat and it&amp;#39;s very calorie dense. Yes, I know fat is not too be feared on keto, but sometimes you just can&amp;#39;t spare the calories. Plus some people are avoiding dairy. Egg whites have no fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk eggs. Pasteurization changes the makeup of the whites and some brands whip easier than others. I&amp;#39;ve had the most success with the Walmart house brand Great Value. The Costco Kirkland brand was a complete failure for me. Dried egg white powders also work, but reconstituting them with the right amount of water can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a hand or stand mixer with a wire whisk attachment and a glass or stainless steel mixing bowl. Plastic bowls can hold grease which will prevent the whites from whipping. It&amp;#39;s very important to wash the whisk and bowl before starting even if they are clean. Airborne grease can float around and settle onto surfaces, so wash everything with dish soap and rinse well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually make 100g of whites at a time measured by weight, so the ratios given here are for that amount. You can play around with the amounts. Unlike meringue used in recipes this is very forgiving as long as you have clean tools and follow a few basic steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measure your egg whites and let them come to room temperature to get the most volume. If you&amp;#39;re in a hurry you can just whip them right from the fridge, they just won&amp;#39;t rise as high. Add a pinch of cream of tartar or a small amount of lemon juice and beat on slow speed until the whites start to foam. Add your sweetener a little at a time (I usually use Lakanto granulated and start with half a tablespoon) and increase the speed. The whites will take on a smooth, shiny appearance. Whip until the whites reach the soft peak stage, then you can taste for sweetness to see if you need to add more sweetener and add your flavoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanilla extract is the old standby, but there is a huge variety of baking and candy making flavors that work great. Basically anything that is not an oil or has an oil base. Oil will deflate your meringue. You can buy them from Amazon, vape suppliers, hobby shops and baking/candy making suppliers. These are very powerful and since you&amp;#39;re not cooking the meringue they don&amp;#39;t bake out so little goes a long way. Just a few drops will usually do it. Some of my favorite flavors: butter pecan, butter vanilla, raspberry, peach and kiwi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whip until everything is incorporated and enjoy immediately. I eat it right from the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the length. It didn&amp;#39;t look that long when I was typing it out. 🤣&lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Hi everyone!

It’s been a while since I’ve revisited this community. I wanted to share a little bit about my progress with keto when I first started February 1st 2019 until now, February 28th, 2021.

When I started keto I was very heavily invested. And went down from 182 to 153 in the span of 4 months. When 2020 hit, I had lost track slightly but maintained at 155. When covid-19 started I vowed to remain on track despite gym closures and lockdowns. 

But after 4 months of strict keto and meeting my goal weight of 145, I started to lose mental strength. I was revisiting depressive states. 

I’ve been doing some researching and reading other user experiences. Keto takes a lot of mental willpower to get started. Once you have that foundation and ketosis going it’s hard to shake those habits as I’ve learned, but depression can take control due to unforeseen circumstances (COVID for example).

Anyways, after going through 2020 and it’s awful awful challenges (family getting sick and passing away, job struggles) I fell into darker and darker moods and just gave up essentially. Needless to say I gained the majority of my weight back. I am at about 173 now and just really hate myself so much for letting myself get off track like this. 

I wanted to share this with you all and myself because I plan on starting from experience once more. Starting tomorrow, March 1st I will go back to my strict keto regimen and reach my goal weight of 145 again. I will fight my depression because I miss being happier when I was at that weight. I hope this can inspire those who have fallen off track and I’m sorry for it being so long. I want to be strong for myself and my happiness and I won’t give up this time.

Since then I started business trips again which stopped my progress, but I'm super proud that it didn't revert it, which was my biggest fear, because I don't have a kitchen on my long 3 moths business trips, which makes calorie counting practically impossible, but OMAD is a big help there.

,keto,"Hi all,  


I (M/34)  have attempted keto a few times, but it always ended after drinking on a night out and being unable/willing to get back on it.  


This time - I started on 1st Feb 2021.  I just cut carbs out, and generally kept it below 20g a day.  


**Weight:**

I had a cracking first week, losing 9.4lb.  And I was confident I would continue to smash it (but not at those numbers of course).

I have tracked my weight daily, and there were 4 instances of me gaining weight.  Each of those instances were after I had cheated.  I would have a takeaway, and then gain weight.   It would then take a few days to sort of continue my weight loss.

I finished February 12.6lb down - so I'm still happy with that generally.  


239.2lb &gt; 226.6lb  


**Snoring:**

The main thing I have realised, is that when I am sticking to it - my (horrendous) snoring pretty much stops.  On those cheat days, the snoring kicks straight back in.  I am going to be tracking  and experimenting this, and introducing foods to try and pinpoint what kind of food seems to make snore.  

**Struggles:**

I have been much better than previous attempts, but have had a number of struggles when I didn't eat early enough, and that is when I would fall off and have a takeaway.  After each of these times, I would gain weight and usually feel like shit the next day.  So I have definitely gained an understanding that ""if I want it, I will pay the next day"".  It is like going out on a night out, I will be hungover the next day.

On a good note though, I have got back on it the next day with no real issues.  If I felt hungrier than usual, I would eat more, but kept it Keto.  In the past I would have just been like ""screw it, I failed"".  This time, I acknowledge I messed up but got back on it rather than giving up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Realised Benefits:**  


* I have lost weight.
* I feel much, much better without all the sugar.
* I am not as bloated anymore - I needed to put another hole in my belt.  
* I made fat bombs - they are amazing! Cream cheese, Peanut butter, Desiccated coconut.
* I realised I loveeeee crispy bacon.  
* No chocolate or crisps for a month = happy partner, because she doesn't have to look at empty containers
* My snoring decreased to the point that my mrs quite often didn't need to put in ear plugs, so she slept better.
* Have realised that meal planning for the week usually helps.  Indecision leads to failure! If I know what I am going to eat, then It is easier to stick to.

&amp;#x200B;

**Plan for March:**

* Introduce strength training.  I know people say you don't need to exercise - but I really want to.  I want to get strong (will introduce light cardio in April I think).
* Get more food quick keto food in the house, so if I start to feel tempted, I can just grab the food before I get tempted to eat carbs.
* Try some more varied meals

&amp;#x200B;

So overall, ups and downs, but generally I am happy with the first month.  I have been better than usual attempts, although it usually included a weekly mess up.  I know I feel much better on Keto than my usual eating pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

My weight loss target was to lose 2lb a week, and my goal target is 75kg, so that would mean sticking at it until mid Octoberish.  However, weight aside, I want to get healthy.  I want to feel that I can move without feeling crap.  I want to get out and do more things.  I want to get back into kickboxing.  I don't wanna be a fat guy anymore.

&lt;p&gt;I (M/34)  have attempted keto a few times, but it always ended after drinking on a night out and being unable/willing to get back on it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time - I started on 1st Feb 2021.  I just cut carbs out, and generally kept it below 20g a day.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a cracking first week, losing 9.4lb.  And I was confident I would continue to smash it (but not at those numbers of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tracked my weight daily, and there were 4 instances of me gaining weight.  Each of those instances were after I had cheated.  I would have a takeaway, and then gain weight.   It would then take a few days to sort of continue my weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished February 12.6lb down - so I&amp;#39;m still happy with that generally.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;239.2lb &amp;gt; 226.6lb  &lt;/p&gt;

,keto,"Hi everyone! 

I started my health reboot journey mid September 2020. 

Routine:

1. IF
2. Cut out sugar and junk food entirely 
3. Walked my steps on some days

I’m down 55 lbs and I have around 80 more lbs left to go. 

I understood that I just couldn’t continue living my life at 122 kilos. My face was breaking out continuously, my hair stopped looking healthy, and I hated living in my own body!

I’m in a much happier place mentally and physically. 

I have a wedding to attend in exactly two months and I am so excited to lose more weight by then. I have such gorgeous outfits in mind - I’ll be sharing those pictures when the time comes haha!

I had a very toxic relationship with food and my outlook was extremely negative. I found no reason to be happy. Now? Now, I don’t need any reason to be happy, I just AM!

Hello everyone... I want to be very careful when I write this, because I want these words to act as a talisman of healing instead of a trigger... 

Without getting too much into detail, I have suffered from probably every eating disorder possible. It began as anorexia, then turned into bulimia, with ""chewing and spitting"" disorder. I've binged and purged and chewed and spat, and denied and withheld for probably about 13 years now. I've tried everything, been in therapy (which has helped immensely, please go to a COMPETENT therapist!!!), and still though-- I would return to my same addiction of chewing/spitting and then denying myself food for so long that I would purge. 

It was hell. Honestly. 

But as you all know, eating disorders come to us as charlatans, and whisper to us that ""they can keep us safe from our pain and trauma."" But gosh it's a lie. 

In the morning I eat eggs and a heaping two tablespoons of butter. I've started using grass-fed Kerrygold butter and it makes me feel full and it has cured my from my sugar addiction (which led me to binge and purge). 

I'm so happy it hurts. I haven't felt this freedom since I was a child. 

Keto probably saved my life. Eating butter is the only thing that prevents me from binge/purging... I don't know how, but it's magic. 

I eat the entire egg now. And a heaping two tablespoons of butter. And I allow myself to enjoy the taste. 

I love butter. And eggs. Especially the yolk. 

Grateful for the Keto community... and for butter! 

Sending everyone here all of my love and healing.

It’s been a month since I lost weigh to in a week and I’m down 2 lbs in the last 4 weeks. I had alcohol for the first time in 2 months which might of done it. I had a bottle and a half of red wine over the course of last weekend but I didn’t think this would cause me to gain 4 lbs in a week. 

I lost about 80 lbs on Atkins 12 years ago,  and kept it off with low carb eating for about 9 years staying between 220-245 until I medically discharged from the Army 3 years ago. I was happy at this weight and played rugby and other sports. Though I was big I could run for miles and was overall happy. I just had a baby and during a life insurance check found out I had ballooned to 333, I thought I was 290ish so this was quite the shock. 

My diet does not include any processed food except for Trader Joe’s 0 carb salami here and there which I eat with cheese. I mostly eat eggs, bacon, cheese, chicken, ground beef, turkey, and avocados. I thought I was overdoing it on the mixed nuts which were stalling my weight loss through the last few weeks so i stopped that. I tend to avoid many of the Keto type recipes and instead keep it simple except for a meal on the weekend. This would be like Keto pizza dough or cauliflower rice and curry that I make. 

Do you all think more broccoli with like lunch and dinner can help me keep my overall calories down? I do have 2 nuun 2g sugar tablets a day and that seems to help with the headaches I sometimes get. I also try and exercise 5+ days a week which is sometimes just a walk but often 1-2hrs of low intensity heavy lifting, intensity varies based on how much my back hurts and I do about 20 minutes of medium intensity cardio. Overall my wife seems to think I’m having NSVs but it’s damn demotivating to not be dropping weight. 

For breakfast I’ve been having 4 scrambled eggs, hunk of cheese, and 2-3 pieces of bacon . Lunch will be like 4 chicken thighs. For dinner I often have a lb of ground beef with maybe cheese of guac. And then I’ll often have a fancy cheese plate with some sausage. I eat like this most days and I just don’t really get why I’m not dropping.

I’m happy to have gotten to the point where this is no longer the case and my pursuit of health comes from a place of kindness and understanding.&lt;br/&gt;
I hope this resonates with some of you if you’re using keto for WL. I hope you ignore the self-hatred and try to find positive sources of motivation, too. You can do it!&lt;/p&gt;

With the UK in full lockdown it seemed the perfect time to finally give keto a try after lurking here for years. Have hit it pretty aggressively (under 20 net carbs each day) combined with lots of walking and some running too (trained up to running a 10k a couple of weeks back).

Used the Diet Doctor intro trial and then have used their service since then to make my own meal plans. Much easier than counting calories. Mostly don’t eat breakfast and roughly do 18:6 fasting. Even allow myself 2 squares of 90% dark chocolate as a treat after dinner each night (0.1 net carbs per square).

Crucially, using my Apple Watch to make sure either way I clock up 1,000 calories of activity each day. 380km+ cumulative total in walking/running in February.

Was discussing my weight with a nurse in mid-January and he said that if I could get under 100kg that would be huge. Well, here I am already and now I’m inspired to keep working and get myself down to a completely healthy weight.

Not sure if I can maintain keto once ‘real life’ resumes, but it’s definitely working for me at the moment. Best diet I’ve ever tried.

,keto,"Hello

Recently I have been thinking about why there is so many successful stories with keto and how much it made people happier. Many diets can lead to weight loss but that weight loss itself won't make you feel better as much. I heard/read once and I still remember that on keto you start to be healthy to lose weight not lose weight to be healthy and that changed my thinking about the diet and diets overall.

I think it is safe to say that keto is so good because on top of weight loss you are starting to feel better, healthier and have more energy. It makes you start just doing more things in life. Maybe finish things you always put aside or finally looked around you and thought what can you do about it or how to improve you life. I started reading more books and finish old ones. Started learning more and spending more time on doing something rather than nothing. It is well known that brain thrives on ketones and I am not sure if that is the reason but might be.

,keto,"Hello,

So I started this keto journey back in September 2020, and everything was great. I've lost 4 kg in 3 months. It was a bit slow slow, but every bit lost was a win for me. Went from 65.5kg to 61kg. 

Everything fell back on Christmas when I spent 2 weeks on my parents house, needless to say more, I went back to 64kg.

  
Coming with the new year's resolutions, I started back on keto again. I lost 1kg in January and got my weight back in February.

I'm doing everything right, I'm doing less than 20carbs  and 1100 calories per day (sometimes even less), I've been counting my macros everyday, but I still can't lose weight at all. :(

Even started working out more 2 months ago, and still not losing weight at all, I'm not even sure what I'm doing wrong.

My main meals have been chicken legs, beef, pork, broccoli, lettuce, eggs, bacon, sometimes I do a fathead pizza but its like once per week. I've also cut on cheese by a lot as well, still didn't work.

Apart from not losing weight, I do still feel better though, not tired anymore, sleep better (although I do have to pee twice per night so I wake up a few times).

&lt;p&gt;Coming with the new year&amp;#39;s resolutions, I started back on keto again. I lost 1kg in January and got my weight back in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing everything right, I&amp;#39;m doing less than 20carbs  and 1100 calories per day (sometimes even less), I&amp;#39;ve been counting my macros everyday, but I still can&amp;#39;t lose weight at all. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even started working out more 2 months ago, and still not losing weight at all, I&amp;#39;m not even sure what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main meals have been chicken legs, beef, pork, broccoli, lettuce, eggs, bacon, sometimes I do a fathead pizza but its like once per week. I&amp;#39;ve also cut on cheese by a lot as well, still didn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from not losing weight, I do still feel better though, not tired anymore, sleep better (although I do have to pee twice per night so I wake up a few times). But the non weight loss this is just saddening me overall.&lt;/p&gt;

I started Keto on the 2nd of September at 350lbs. After 25 weeks I’m at 275lbs. 
I’ve lost 75 pounds in only a few months. I'm halfway there. My goal is to weigh under 200 pounds.

Now some backstory about myself:

I’ve been obese my entire life. I was bullied throughout elementary school for being fat, this only caused me to find comfort in food. I started so many diets, beginning when I was in 4th grade. Only once did I lose a lot of weight with diets, this was in 2013/14 when I lost about 23kg (50 pounds). But after I managed to lose all of that weight, my family and I moved to the United States. Shortly after moving here, I gained back way more than I lost. Speaking little to no English was tough. I used to be an extroverted person with lots of friends, but suddenly I was alone. I became someone who would not leave the bedroom unless it was necessary. I started having thoughts and feelings of self-hatred in 2015, and they keep intensifying as time passed. No person in my life knows about it but I've been depressed for about six years. I used food to cope with my emotions. I would eat all day and I wouldn't stop eating until I physically was not able to keep going. I wondered how normal people knew if they were “full,” as “full” to me meant “when your stomach aches and you are close to throwing up.” I was consciously eating myself to death. 
Fast forward to early-2020. I meet this girl at work and we become extremely close friends, we're both the same age and into the same things. I have never believed that girls would be interested in me, not only because of me being extremely overweight but because I have a very low opinion about myself. We would talk ALL THE TIME, we would play video games together, and we would stay up until 6 in the morning texting and sending each other funny pictures of ourselves. After some time she started to constantly send me flirty texts, however, I believed she didn't mean them like that because who the fuck would ever be flirty with me? As I learned later, it seems that she liked me, and.. well... I REALLY LIKED HER, I liked her more than I have ever liked anyone in my entire life. But being insecure and thinking no girl could ever like me led to me not doing shit about it. She thought that I wasn’t interested, then she was having problems at home and moved to a different city and kinda stopped talking to me. This, plus a lot more shit that happened in between sunk me even deeper. I hit rock bottom mentally. I felt truly torn to pieces. Life hadn't had any meaning for years, but then I somehow felt even worse. I started a journal, in which I would write my thoughts mostly every day. I tried taking a look at it a few days ago and I simply cannot believe I felt like that. Those were the worst months of my life. I couldn’t function. I couldn’t do things that I would previously do all the time. I couldn’t watch movies or series, I couldn’t play video games, I couldn’t talk to anyone, I couldn’t even think clearly. All I could do to pass the time was to go on 5-6 hour drives listening to The Smiths and Joy Division, and playing “I Know It’s Over” (by The Smiths) and “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You” (by Led Zeppelin) on a loop. According to Spotify Wrapped, I listened to the Smiths for around 400 hours, and I listened to “I Know It’s Over” 440 times. I’m impressed with that considering I started listening to the Smiths in June 2020. 

About a month later, seeing all of this self-hatred and hopelessness, I said to myself “fuck it, I might as well try to get better, what can I lose?”
So I made a list of things I had to work on, 12 things that I wanted to change/improve. So I took action. I started seeing one of my school’s therapists, I picked up drumming again, and I chose to start Keto, amongst other things. All I knew about keto was that one of my aunts was on it and she had lost a bunch of weight. I started Keto on the 2nd of September, three days after making that list. Now it's been over 25 weeks and I have lost 75 pounds. My goal is to lose 150. I love to be Keto, and I truly want to stay on it for the rest of my life, as Keto saved my life. 

Now, I wouldn’t say that I’m happy, but I am in a really good place compared to where I had been for the past few years. And I am motivated to continue and at the very least reach a point where I feel comfortable in my own body.

,keto," I have done keto before and I lost about 7 kg. I couldn't get a lot of the ingredients due to the covid lockdown , so i had to eat what I got .

So I need to somehow fit the fasting with my workout, etc. 
I would need your suggestions as to what you think makes sense? 

This is my schedule: 
8 am : coffee with MCT oil 
11 am : eat meal ( I eat most of what I have to eat here)

7 pm : gym 

I generally drink whey after a workout, but I am not able to fit it in this current schedule because it would interfere with my fasting. I can't really go to the gym in the mornings because I have other responsibilities aka walking my dog , etc plus I work late sometimes so I would want an extra hour of sleep some days.

First, I read the rules &amp; the FAQ's.

I have gone weeks  maintaining sub 50g carbs per day (no starches, grains etc) and I have been feeling absolutely depleted after working out.  I have tried to combat this with sleep, extra calories, electrolytes, broth, fat bombs etc.  I hired a nutritionist to check my macros and calorie counts.  However, nothing worked thus far.  I broke down and had some carbs after a deadlift day and it was like I was super-charged and felt amazing.  I hit a personal best.  However, I don't like the cravings and crappy feeling that comes with eating starches (over time) so I would like to continue on this path and be able to work out hard.
