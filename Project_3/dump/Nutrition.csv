# The Subreddit Rules

***Note: Avoid asking for exemptions since the rules and moderation should be applied fairly and equally to all. Fully read any response you receive from a mod, including automoderator, before messaging for an appeal.***

**1) No dietary activism for or against any diet** - Diet wars are NOT welcome here. Crusading is usually off topic and often intended to be inflammatory. Participants in this subreddit have a variety of dietary requirements, beliefs, body types, and goals. Being a diet fan is fine.  Being a jerk fan or jerk anti-fan of a diet is not okay and will result in a ban.  **DO NOT**;

* **engage disrespectfully towards other diets/beliefs** - inform instead. Talk TO them, not ABOUT the other person / group,
* **downvote due to someone's diet preference**
* **promote or argue ethics and morals** 
* **promote diet absolutism** - no diet is the *only* healthy one.  You CAN say ""this is best for me"" and explain why and what it emphasizes
* **make specious claims** - chronic disease cure claims are not allowed.  Saying it ""can control the symptoms of"" is fine if that is the case
* **engage in pitchforking or brigading** - avoid doing it to this or any other subreddit or the posts therein
* **bias whine** - is not helpful. ""I'm downvoted because I eat (name diet)"" is just shit stirring and trying to play martyr
* **excessively advertise a diet based subreddit** - talk about your favorite diet but only advertise the sub for it in no more than 1/10 of your activity

**2) No personalized nutrition inquiry posts. Instead ask in the comments section of the** **[/r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2)** - If your post contains *ANY* personal context (it pertains to you, your diet, your family member(s) or anyone within your sphere) and/or a diet evaluation request (something you or someone in your life ate, are eating, or thinking about consuming), *it will be removed*, no exceptions. **Trying to end run this rule, pretending it is unclear, or making any kind of baseless, false, disingenuous, or entitlement based appeals will result in a ban.**

**3) [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) is required** - Avoid flame wars and vote complaining. Trolling, insults, brigading, or antagonism towards the subreddit participants, the moderators, or even the community itself may also result in a ban. Instead of bashing, share sources, citations, and studies, as well as accept when your positions are going to differ. Walk away if something angers you.

**4) No blogspam and/or self-promotion** - Any form of linking, referencing, or mentioning of things you are affiliated with will be removed and likely result in a ban. This applies to your sites, videos, media channels, books, articles, surveys, etc.  The sub is here to talk about nutrition science, not what you've created. Do not try to use the sub to drive traffic to something you are involved with, even if it is free.  IRB approved surveys may be approved if a request is sent to the moderators.

**5) No requesting or providing medical advice** - these problem posts usually involve a disease, a diagnosis, a lab value, and/or discussion you've had with a health professional.  You can ask how nutrition impacts humans in general but you may not ask for advice about treating or managing a medical conditions or how a nutritional choice would impact your specific medial condition (or a family member).  *All medical questions should be directed to a physician, dietitian, or other qualified and licensed health care provider who has access to your personal medical records.* It is dangerous to solicit medical advice on an internet forum. It is also illegal in most cases and against health care codes of ethics for users to provide it to you in this forum.

**6) All links must be direct links** - The reddit site filter removes uses of link shorteners.  Use a direct URL instead. Submissions of links using link tracking services will lead to an instant ban.

**7) No posts from brand new accounts and negative karma accounts** - Brand new accounts may not make new posts in this subreddit.  However, you can comment on other posts while you get to know the site and subreddit. Negative karma accounts cannot post or comment here.


# Suggestions

These suggestions are offered to improve your experience in the subreddit.

* Refrain from a ""once-size-fits-all"" stance regarding nutrition.  Accept that there are other approaches which you may not agree with, other body types, and a variety of goals.

* Include proper, relevant, and useful information when asking or answering questions.  Provide links to studies, articles, research, papers, etc. when offering your viewpoint.  Need to find the evidence? Check out [**PubMed**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) or [**Google Scholar**](http://www.scholar.google.com).  

* It may be FAQ. If you have a question, [**search**](http://www.reddit.com/help/search) before you post or take a look at our new [**FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/wiki/faq#/c/purple/) which we've started

* Report posts and comments which violate site or subreddit rules. Don’t report comments and posts over disagreement. It is a waste of time and is report abuse.


# User Flair

You can set your user flair to indicate your level of nutrition expertise/education. Do not select a user flair you are not qualified for. Anyone who is not able to verify their user flair status when asked to do so may be banned.

# Moderators Needed

As our sub has rapidly grown, so has our need to expand the moderation team. We are looking to add several experienced Reddit users who have a passion for nutrition and a desire to help curate [/r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) as a collegial space for informative nutrition discussions.

Here is what we are looking for from applicants. Please send applications to [modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nutrition).

1. Mods should have a strong history of **positive** contributions to [/r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition). Please send us several direct links to comments from your account history to substantiate this.
2. We are looking for mods of all backgrounds, but particularly for RDNs or others with formal academic training in nutrition. Please tell us about your educational background and your current field of work.
3. Modding experience on Reddit is great, but not required. Ditto for having a little coding experience. Let us know whether you mod any other subs and if you have any relevant experience like moderating other forums/pages, using back-end web tools, etc.
4. Mods need to be frequent Reddit users. The ideal mod is someone who pops into Reddit multiple times per day, can devote some time to addressing moderator issues when logging on, and foresees continuing to do so in the future.
5. You should be a team player who is on board with following processes and procedures including using communications channels so that we stay on the same page and present a united and consistent front that prioritizes [r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) and its core users.
6. You should be someone who is comfortable enforcing rules and able to handle receiving harsh/critical feedback from strangers on the internet without breaking down, losing your temper, or giving in.

If you are interested in applying, please [message the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nutrition) with *a note which addresses all the points above (please use numbering)*. Do not leave your application as a comment here.

I practice intermittent fasting and have recently decided to increase my protein intake substantially. I go to to work at 6:30 AM and typically have my first meal at 4:00 PM. It took me a long time to find my perfect lunch box which basically includes the following:

* A bowl of mixed greens with a light dressing (balsamic vinegar &amp; olive oil) on the side
* 2 grilled cheese sandwiches in Saj (Markouk) bread
* A fat handful of sliced coloured peppers and cucumbers
* A handful of almonds and walnuts
* An apple

This is the best combination of foods that I could think of that would be nutritious and safe to eat given that they'd be out of the refrigerator for quite some time. However, I've recently started weightlifting and I need to increase my protein intake significantly. Obviously, foods like eggs and meats are out of the question since they'd be out for so long so I've been trying to find some protein-rich foods that wont spoil by 4:00 PM. I don't want to double or triple my almond intake because they're quite dense in calories and also they'd get pretty boring pretty quickly. It's worth noting that I store my lunch in a *thermally insulated* lunch bag; however, I try not to rely on that too much.

Customization of mental health therapies needs to consider the differences in degree of brain maturity between young (18–29 years) and mature (30 years or older) adults as well as brain morphology among men and women. The aim of this study was to identify the significant dietary and lifestyle contributors to mental distress in these sub-populations. Independent repeated cross-sectional sampling was performed for over a 5-year period (2014–2019) to collect data from different populations at different time-points and seasons. A backward stepwise regression analysis was used on 2628 records. Mental distress in young women was associated with high consumption of caffeine and fast-food, and it was negatively correlated with moderate-high levels of exercise as well as frequent breakfast consumption. Mature women shared several common factors with young women; however, high fruit consumption was negatively associated with mental distress. For young men, high exercise, moderate consumption of dairy, and moderate-high intake of meat were negatively associated with mental distress. In addition, high fast-food and caffeine consumption were positively associated with mental distress in young men. For mature men, strong negative associations between higher education, moderate intake of nuts and mental distress surfaced. Our results support the need to customize dietary and lifestyle recommendations to improve mental wellbeing.

,nutrition,"Years ago I remember reading about a comment from a Roman soldier who despised athletes and had a strong dislike for Roman sports (even gladiator fighting). He stated athletes live under such luxurious comfortable conditions with very fine foods and the lots of rest time. While being a soldier meant having minimal rest and some generic yucky food like raw cereal grain and bland porridge. It is this reason why he prefers being a grunt in the frontline because he prides himself as being so tough from having experienced hell in the wars he fought in. He cannot understand the appeal behind sports and why Roman citizens revere athletes like GODS. This does bring a question.

Throughout military history, there are multiple stories of soldiers fighting for days nonstop without proper food, water, and even sleep. They are already exhausted from prior skirmishes and marching so theoretically they shouldn't have the energy to continue holding a fortress or charge on with an aggressive attacks. Yet against impossible odds they succeed in such missions.

Dien Bien Phu is one such example in which during the final months of the battle, the French ran out of proper diets, adequate water, and have not had days of sleep. The fortress should have fallen about a month earlier but even under such conditions the French soldiers were able to last a month longer than should be possible.

In the battles of Antioch, the Crusaders were already starving to death by the time they took the fortress from the Turks and had a few skirmishes with outside Turkish forces that came as an answer a message requesting for aid sent by the now dead ruler of the city prior to its capture. Yet in the battle that occurred just a few days later, the heavily outnumbered European knights were able to fight off a much larger well-fed Turkish army that haven't even exerted real energy in battle.

In the Civil War, the primary reason for Confederate soldier to aggressively attack larger Union forces was to find food because they were starving and its more impressive due they actually succeeded in such engagements!

But in the athletic world, attempting to compete without proper nutrition for even a few days is suicidal. Even the sturdiest athletes with the strongest willpower like James Braddock would be massacred if they don't have a proper specialized diet. Not even modern soldier rations (which are healthy when compared to all the junk food out there) can be sufficient for an athlete for one full day of regular training. Athletes need very specialized diet that would be too expensive (or too precise to create) for the general public to indulge in.

Even taking out minor details of the diet like a single serving of meat or all the vegetables would prove devastating to athletic performance. But as I mentioned soldiers are able to perform well without proper diet and I listed many examples in which soldiers are already starving themselves to death are able to fight fiercely for a last stand and even gain miraculous victories!

Are there certain lids, which help?

Also fermenting with vinegar would not be an option I guess.

What about lactofermentation? Bad idea?

I’d be open to ferment anything: sauerkraut (juice), blueberries, fish, quail eggs, egg yolks (is that even possible?), organ meats...

But I’m a very sensitive to grains, seeds, nuts, nightshades and dairy (yes, A1 and A2 dairy unfortunately, even if goats cheese is awesome), which is why I’d avoid doing anything with them.

Coconut works a bit, and I’d be interested in how to ferment that when you do not have any fresh coconuts but only the canned milk.

Also- can you ferment things which previously have been frozen? Such as frozen tuna? I thought about fermenting some by adding store bought lacto-fermented cabbage juice.

Which strains can you recommend for histamine intolerance? I know, it’s possible to ferment foods just by themselves, but wouldn’t it be beneficial to add some beneficial strains?

Also I’ve got chronic Epstein Barr, maybe you can recommend some beneficial strain against that?

Let's say I want to take it to 650. 

I found one tablet of 500 mcg. Let's say I figure out average absortion rate based on the type and average on population. 

So I run the calculation of one year supplementation. Is there any app calculator / graph that show me how the serum levels would act? Would be 500mcg be enough to get there someday? Would the levels plateau after some time? or would they continue increasing indefinitly? 

(All based on aproximations, I know it depends on each individual abosortion rate and particular metabolism, and no forecast will be better than a plain blood test. But just would like to get a feel of it based on average assumptions and numbers)

My assumption is that the various co-factors in the root itself are more bioactive than the powdered form but maybe the difference is not significant.  The root seems to hold a lot of water; therefore, the powder is likely much more concentrated.  I have no idea how much raw to ingest to get an equivalent amount provided in a teaspoon of powder.  Does anyone have thoughts or a source to answer these questions?

One a related topic, I was looking whether to supplement with turmeric vs curcumin.  I came across this write up on the ATP Science Project which is run by naturopaths.  This article is response to a 2017 scientific study says there is absolutely zero science showing any benefit from curcumin.  The naturopaths response is that curcumins should be ingested by using turmeric which the body will properly process in the gut and liver which is a requirement to make it bioavailable/efficacious.   They also advise against using pepper to make turmeric/curcumin bioavailable.

I'm a little confused though. Most nutritional information I have found for a raw pound of chicken wings is anywhere from 1k and up.

Then the USDA says there is 240 calories in 3oz of cooked edible portions of a chicken wing.

So theoretically, 1 pound of raw chicken wings would equate to 6.08oz edible yield (.38), with the USDA info would result in 486.4 calories.

**Abstract**

**Background**
Dietary recommendations regarding protein intake have been focused on the amount of protein. However, such recommendations without considering specific protein sources may be simplistic and insufficient.

**Methods and Results**
We included 102 521 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative between 1993 and 1998, and followed them through February 2017. During 1 876 205 person‐years of follow‐up, 25 976 deaths occurred. Comparing the highest with the lowest quintile, plant protein intake was inversely associated with all‐cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91 [0.86, 0.96]), cardiovascular disease mortality (HR, 0.88 [0.79, 0.97]), and dementia mortality (HR, 0.79 [0.67, 0.94]). Among major protein sources, comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of consumption, processed red meat (HR, 1.06 [1.01, 1.10]) or eggs (HR, 1.14 [1.10, 1.19]) was associated with higher risk of all‐cause mortality. Unprocessed red meat (HR, 1.12 [1.02, 1.23]), eggs (HR, 1.24 [1.14, 1.34]), or dairy products (HR, 1.11 [1.02, 1.22]) was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. Egg consumption was associated with higher risk of cancer mortality (HR, 1.10 [1.02, 1.19]). Processed red meat consumption was associated with higher risk of dementia mortality (HR, 1.20 [1.05, 1.32]), while consumption of poultry (HR, 0.85 [0.75, 0.97]) or eggs (HR, 0.86 [0.75, 0.98]) was associated with lower risk of dementia mortality. In substitution analysis, substituting of animal protein with plant protein was associated with a lower risk of all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and dementia mortality, and substitution of total red meat, eggs, or dairy products with nuts was associated with a lower risk of all‐cause mortality.

**Conclusions**
Different dietary protein sources have varying associations with all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and dementia mortality.

,nutrition,"For example - 

- 100 grams of **Chicken breast, skin eaten** (NCCDB) -  184 calories, 27.4 grams of protein, and 7.4 grams of fat.

- 100 grams of **Chicken, broilers or fryers, breast, meat and skin, raw** (USDA) is 172 calories, 20.9 grams of protein, and 9.3g of fat.

My conclusion here is that the NCCDB entry is for cooked chicken, not raw, and so the calories differ for that reason (water weight changes). 

So let's adjust the calories to be equal, and then compare macros. 

I haven't even looked at micronutrients, but if macros can be so different, I assume micros can, too.

So we still have, for example -

- 100 grams of **Chicken breast, skin eaten** (NCCDB) -  184 calories, 27.4 grams of protein, and 7.4 grams of fat.

And then also

- 107 grams of **Chicken, broilers or fryers, breast, meat and skin, raw** (USDA) is 184 calories, 22.3 grams of protein, and 9.9g of fat.

,nutrition,"From what I understand, some people frown upon using seed/veggie oils for cooking due to their generally high omega 6 to omega 3 ratio, as well as the harmful compounds that form when such oils are heated. How much influence an oil's smoke point has on the formation of harmful compounds seems to be variable--was it [this study](https://actascientific.com/ASNH/pdf/ASNH-02-0083.pdf) saying it doesn't matter much? idk

Anyway, barring the expensive price, **does anyone know whether chia oil is suitable for cooking?** One website has its smoke point listed at a very high value of 486 F (252 C).

How much influence an oil&amp;#39;s smoke point has on the formation of harmful compounds seems to be variable--was it &lt;a href=""https://actascientific.com/ASNH/pdf/ASNH-02-0083.pdf""&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; saying it doesn&amp;#39;t matter much? idk&lt;/p&gt;

If&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;drinking water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;at the same time, what&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;are actually doing is diluting the digestive juices being released to digest your food, thereby hindering them from breaking down food.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can someone elaborate on which of these answers is correct?&lt;/p&gt;

,nutrition,"I've been looking into the subject of cutting off sugar from one's life, and when trying to learn more about the subject, I realized that when people talk  about ""removing sugar"", they actually mean removing ***added***  sugar from their lives. The terminology ""removing sugar"" greatly confused me, because when delving into the subject and looking at ""no  sugar"" challenges, people merely remove snacks and other extras from their lives.

In the instance of someone having a healthy/balanced diet (i.e, no white sugar/bread/rice, making home-made bread, etc), are small amounts of sugar alright? When checking nutrients contents, I've realized that most foods contain some sugar. An example is this pack of red rice I'm looking at which has 0.6g of sugar in total. Another example, a pack of wholemeal flour I sometimes use has got 2.0g of sugar. 

I'm European, so the way this looks on packages is ""carbohydrates: \[amount\], of which sugar: \[amount\].""

Should sugar be COMPLETELY removed from one's diet, as in not a single trace of it at all anywhere? Or are small amounts alright, or even necessary? I'm trying to understand because the majority of people talking about the subject seem to be Americans trying to rid themselves of excess snacks/processed foods/junk foods, which should go without saying, but they use the terminology ""removing sugar."" After doing some reading, it seems that ""removing sugar"" has a number of health benefits, but I'm still unclear on whether that's ALL sugar or just excess sugar.

The terminology &amp;quot;removing sugar&amp;quot; greatly confused me, because when delving into the subject and looking at &amp;quot;no  sugar&amp;quot; challenges, people merely remove snacks and other extras from their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the instance of someone having a healthy/balanced diet (i.e, no white sugar/bread/rice, making home-made bread, etc), are small amounts of sugar alright? When checking nutrients contents, I&amp;#39;ve realized that most foods contain some sugar. An example is this pack of red rice I&amp;#39;m looking at which has 0.6g of sugar in total. Another example, a pack of wholemeal flour I sometimes use has got 2.0g of sugar. &lt;/p&gt;

Evaluation of the deleterious health effects of consumption of repeatedly heated vegetable oil

Abstract

Consumption of repeatedly heated cooking oil (RHCO) has been a regular practice without knowing the harmful effects of use. The present study is based on the hypothesis that, heating of edible oils to their boiling points results in the formation of free radicals that cause oxidative stress and induce damage at the cellular and molecular levels. Peroxide value of heated oil, histopathological alterations, antioxidant enzyme levels and blood biochemistry were determined in Wistar rats treated with the RHCO. RHCO revealed higher peroxide value in comparison to oil that has been unheated or singly heated. Histopathological observation depicted significant damage in jejunum, colon and liver of animals that received oil heated repeatedly for 3 times. The altered antioxidant status reflects an adaptive response to oxidative stress. Alteration in the levels of these enzymes might be due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through auto oxidation or enzyme catalyzed oxidation of electrophilic components within RHCO. Analysis of blood samples revealed elevated levels of glucose, creatinine and cholesterol with declined levels of protein and albumin in repeatedly heated cooking oil group. Hematological parameters did not reveal any statistically significant difference between treated and control groups. Results of the present study confirm that the thermal oxidation of cooking oil generates free radicals and dietary consumption of such oil results in detrimental health effects.",t2_6m2x7,False,,0,False,"Consumption of repeatedly heated vegetable oil by rates caused ""significant damage"" in the small intestines, colon and liver.

Assuming there is the „set point“ at which you can eat slightly more or less without gaining or losing significatly:
If you enter a field of „moderate deficit“ out of that area, you will lose weight,
If you overshoot, your metabolism slows down to retain energy, resulting in a decreased speed of weight loss maintaining the same deficit. Which is why many dieticians recommend eating „more“ for a while, when hitting a plateo.

According to that, a chronically starving/anorectic person would enter a massive plateo very quickly, and gain significantly faster when refeeding, than a normal person with equal surplus of calories (hypothetically)

My questions would be: 

How quickly does ones metabolism adapt (roughly)? Can that be in a day/week/month range? Does it depend on the length of accurate feeding/starvation time beforehands? 

Is it metabolically more affecting to be in a constant calorie deficit (like skipping a meal/ chronical restriction) or to go through waves of severe deficits alternating with overshooting periods (lets look at 3/7 fasting days and 2 overcaloric days for example, or restrictive tendencies with bingeing behavior ).
In other words: bingeing for a chronically starved person would be causing more weight gain than if a metabolically normal person would binge the same amount?

(This is all hypothetically of course, it for sure depends on the individual)

If you enter a field of „moderate deficit“ out of that area, you will lose weight,
If you overshoot, your metabolism slows down to retain energy, resulting in a decreased speed of weight loss maintaining the same deficit. Which is why many dieticians recommend eating „more“ for a while, when hitting a plateo.&lt;/p&gt;

The basic idea is that, shockingly enough, its not the carbs or even the sugar intake that is killing us and exploding obesity, its the seed oils.

Sugar intake for Americans peaked about year 2000, and yet obesity has continued to rise. Meanwhile seed oil consumption has kept near perfect pace with obesity rate.

He shows how the Tukisenta native people of Papua New Ginea had a diet of 96% carbs (sweet potatoes)! And yet were lean, healthy, zero obesity, and near zero heart disease.

Meanwhile the Maasai of Africa eat a diet of 45% saturated fat! According the Amer. Heart Assoc they should all be keeling over and dying of heart disease by age 40. And yet they are slim, robust and have near zero heart disease.

The common factor here being these peoples eat ZERO seed oils. None.

He claims seed oils disregulate the insulin system and get oxidized much easier than saturated fat molecules. And the oxidized linoleic acids from the seed oils create ROS's which wreak havoc

 the reason I'm asking this is because I remember reading this health article 4 years ago where the doctor was saying the type of calcium you get is super important and he was saying the body can't even use calcium carbonate and that type is a toxin that just calcifies organs because that is taken from rocks . and the body evolved to absorb calcium not from rocks but from natural foods such as plants or milk or eating bones which contain special types of calcium that plants and animals have modified into more absorbable forms..

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been working okay for me i think&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks I&amp;#39;ve been doing research try to find out what the types of calcium are in food and what are the types that exist in food and I&amp;#39;ve been having a hard time finding information for that on Google . a website will say the calcium content in an orange but not what type of calcium&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i ask... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What type of calcium is found in...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A orange&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animal bone marrow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lettuce&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomato&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone know any of these?&lt;/p&gt;

,nutrition,"First off, I'm wondering if there's any rule on how many grams of (complex) carbs you should/can eat in one meal and still keep being insulin sensitive (prevent insulin resistance (IR)/type 2 diabetes (T2D)). Also, my question kind of stems from intermittent fasting (IF)... Because, if people who do IF skip breakfast they basically skip a meal. So that would mean that they would ""have to"" eat fewer meals, but higher in carbs, during the day (and yes, I know people have different diets and it doesn't HAVE to be like that, but let's say that is in fact the case). I also know that some people already eat high calorie diets so they can skip a meal without compensating for it, but my question is more targeted to people that wouldn't meet their caloric needs if they skipped a meal without compensating for it in the meals they don't skip.

I've heard IF is good for blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity, but I have also heard that meals heavy on carbs are not good for blood sugar. I am really confused on what would be the best approach for people to prevent IR and T2D regarding this. 

So, is there a definite threshold or something on how many grams of carbs a meal can contain without affecting blood sugar/insulin in a negative way? And as the title says, is it better for blood sugar/insulin to actually have meals lower in carb, but eat more meals during the day..

,nutrition,"This is going to be a stupid post with a stupid question and I'm sorry in advance, but I'm still confused.

I'm buying lamb leg steaks from the store. Calories listed on the label are 187 kcal per 100g raw weight. So, I measure the calories for the whole steak, raw.

After cooking the steak, a substantial amount of fat falls out as drippings. I measure the fat removed, find out how many calories are in that weight of pure lamb fat, and subtract those calories from the initial raw weight calories.

Example: let's say I have a steak weighing 230g raw.
187 times 2.3 is 430
So the raw weight is 430
Then I cook it and measure the fat at the bottom of the pan. Let's pretend there's 20g of fat.
20g of lamb fat is 117 calories.
So 430 calories for raw weight, minus 117 calories for the fat lost is 313. So I would log the steak as totaling at 313, keeping in mind that it's mostly fat lost and very little protein lost from the initial nutrition panel of the raw steak.

""But why don't you just weigh the cooked steak instead?""
Because I intentionally like to overcook my steaks as I like that crispiness when you cook lamb well done. So I'm also losing a huge amount of water (zero calories) that the precooked calorie measurements don't account for. So they might say a cooked steak is 230 calories for 100g, but a lot of that is water that isn't present in my overcooked and dry steaks.

So, what I want to know is how accurate my method is Vs just weighing a cooked steak. Am I doing this horribly wrong? Is this fucking myself over and making me miscalculate everything? Is there a better way of doing this? Please tell me if there's a more accurate way of calculating.

The biggest variations are obviously that some cuts of meat are just naturally fattier than other cuts, but I want to try my best with this as much as I can and be as accurate as I can be.

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m looking to find out specifically is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the amino acid profile for Tofu comparable in nutritional quality to meat alternatives? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it really beneficial on a plant based diet to have a mix of protein sources? Rather than just the 1, or is this just a myth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is a large part of the meat-eating community adamant that there is no way to match the quality of protein derived from meat products? Is it just marketing from the meat industry? Or are there actual truths in these arguments?&lt;/li&gt;

Anyone who likes quest protein bars, have you also noticed a difference in taste and size of the bars when you purchase a full 12 batch vs the smaller boxes??
