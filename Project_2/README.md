## Conclusions

This project's model predicted sales prices with a root mean squared error of 31,165. Baseline score is approximately 55,000 and Kaggle's leaderboard top 50 scores are around 20,000 to 33,000.

1. Model had low usage of location features (only MSZoning was used). Most location features were categorical and dummy variables take up too many feature space.
2. Best predictors are area and overall quality.
3. Occam's razor stands true - feature engineering did not provide big benefits.
