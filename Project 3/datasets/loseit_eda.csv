"I met my goal! 175 to 138 over the course of a year This past year I went from an ""obese"" BMI (which I'm pretty sure I didn't look, I carried those pounds like a champ)  to a ""normal"" weight. Face gains can be seen [here!](https://imgur.com/a/1UgSqTb) For reference, I'm 5'4.

I've always been an active person. I was a competitive dancer from ages 5 to 14, and a three-sport athlete as a teenager. I had always been *tiny*, until puberty hit. At that time my metabolism slowed, my chest grew exponentially (32HH UK sizing at its largest), and I hated how I looked. I developed an eating disorder and fought my curvy adult body type until I was in college. I got therapy, started to heal my relationship with food, and my weight steadily went up and up and up. I continued to exercise; hiking, weight lifting, skiing. I was diagnosed with some chronic health problems around that time, including a vein disease, multiple-strain chronic lyme's disease, and chronic pain due to my chest size. I stopped exercising for the most part, because it *hurt*. 

By the time I met my now wife, and finished college, I knew I needed to make changes. I just felt really unhealthy. Obviously, the change I made was to enroll in doctoral-level graduate school! My stress went through the roof, and I also developed hypertension! Second-year of my grad program, I decided to try and get my health and stress under control. My career involves helping others be mentally healthy, and I wasn't healthy myself. So I got surgery to correct my vein disease. I did physical therapy for my chronic pain, and a few months later, I had an insurance-covered breast reduction surgery. Being able to stand on my feet without pain, and with my back pain greatly reduced, I was able to start exercising again.

Then COVID! I gained a good 15 pounds from drinking excess alcohol and eating excess junk food due to boredom and being stuck inside.  I hit my peak of 175, and I knew a ""lifestyle change"" was in order. I was worried about CICO due to my history of eating disorders, and initially had my wife plan my meals for me and count for me. Eventually, I was able to take over control and eat more intuitively, as I had a good understanding of what my portions should be. I'd estimate for Sept 2020 - March 2021 I ate within the range of 1200-1600 calories a day. I also stationary bike most mornings, walk a mile or two every day and hike most weekends. I eat what I want, just small portions and in a mindful way. 

I haven't felt this good ever. The last time I was this thin I was in high school, and actively purging. Now I am thin and strong because I have taken care of myself. I am really proud and sad I can't really share this with most people in my life. My wife is proud of me, as is my mother. My clients haven't noticed, and neither have my friends? Unless it's just hard to tell over Zoom or they don't feel comfortable telling me. It's an odd thing to celebrate. I am so happy I can eat at maintenance now!"
"obese to healthy BMI in 5 months: here is exactly how i did it **a little back story:**

i want to preface this by saying that i spent ten years subscribing to fat acceptance logic, ultimately believing calorie-counting etc. was incongruous with my feminist politics. i still believe fatphobia is a thing; i grew up in a family that was pretty fatphobic, and my parents were consistently derogatory about my aunt's weight. she was morbidly obese and died of bowel cancer in her early 60s. her death was clearly related to her weight but at the time i was just sad that my dad couldn't even have a funeral for her without commenting on her size in pictures. so i know the reasons why fat acceptance logic gets lodged in your brain - it's angering that fat folks are dehumanised to the extent they are, and yes 100% i think that it's wrapped up in misogyny. 

anyway, i was a tall and slender child but also gender-nonconforming from a young age. idk if i would consider myself trans now but i was always non-binary as hell as a kid. puberty and adolescence was extremely traumatic as a queer in a rural village with a lot of homophobia and transphobia at school. so i was body conscious as fuck and desperate to fit in, but always remember riding the wave of my slimness and tallness to insulate me from the additional shame of having excess fat. then i discovered alcohol in my early teens and drank consistently to deal with my sadness, for a very long time. at university this habit really took flight, and wasn't helped by the fact that from my late teens throughout my 20s, i was a touring musician. i was in bars and venues almost every weekend, and often for stretches of a few weeks at a time. my eating and drinking habits went out the window, particularly because payments for gigs for many years incorporated drinks riders and buy-outs. i got used to the idea that i was just going to be 'hench' or a 'big, strong person', which also fitted with my identity as a relatively masculine-of-centre woman who is also a guitarist. 

i discovered exercise properly at about 27, when i decided to try and learn how to jog for my mental health. i loved it but felt like i could never advance properly because i was always recovering from drinking or eating too much. i was vegetarian from age 20 to 29 so was also riding the wave of not eating meat, in terms of my weight remaining relatively stable, despite being above healthy BMI. then i met my partner, a food-loving canadian who is just over 4 years younger than me. she introduced me to the world of north american meat: chicken wings, ribs... we enjoyed ourselves so much as we were getting to know each other but good god: because i hadn't eaten meat really as an adult, i was on meat holiday in a big way. i really went to town, and the whole time i was reading more and more fat acceptance stuff, learning from fat activists in my music scene and community, and touring more than i ever had in my life. i could sense myself expanding but was becoming gradually more alienated from my own body. at the same time, i was deepening my relationship to running, and even did a half marathon. so i was like: yeah, big people can be athletic! and eat whatever they want! woo! 

NOT woo. so from 28 to 31, i was doing a phd. the last year, in particular, involved pretty much sitting all day long. my eating habits and alcohol consumption were also beginning to make exercise less appealing and less possible; i would go for runs and have to break every 10 minutes. alcohol was having a cumulative effect on my mental health: i would have terrible insomnia, i couldn't regulate my temperature, i was consumed with negative thoughts about myself, i had eroding trust in other people and was convinced this was just what life became when you lived in a capitalist hellscape. obviously i figured the best way to deal with these emotions and mental illness was just to....keep drinking whisky and eating M&amp;Ms. and this is the kind of shit i was consuming on instagram too: that i should just listen to my intuition and eat whatever i want because that is self-care.

so anyway, the pandemic comes along and me and my partner - who had become my wife by this point - go HAM with the ham, effectively. we literally spent two months playing breath of the wild, getting shitfaced and ordering mcdonalds. it was, tbh, really fun. but my head and my body were suffering. and i was starting to seriously dislike the way that i looked. thing is, this wasn't a new thing: from childhood i had felt disparaging about my body for obvious reasons, and didn't look in the mirror, for example, for years. when i did look in the mirror it was just for confirmation that i still sucked. but photos of me at gigs from before covid were unavoidable and i was progressively shocked at how overweight i looked. still, these thoughts and feelings came attached to inside voices shaming and policing me for critiquing my own body, as if i was being a terrible feminist and terrible ally to my fat friends. so i just buried it and continued on my merry, buttery way. 

in september i got my first full-time academic job and something in me just totally flipped. i realised i literally couldn't continue drinking in the way that i had been if i wanted to do well as a lecturer. my wife and i were going through an eviction by an evil homophobic landlord that lived in the house above us and the stress of that was also pushing us more and more to shit food and the bottle. i realised i wanted more mental and physical resilience and to live my best life, if only to stick it to people like her. so i bought a scale for the first time in my life. i had not had a scale for my entire 20s, believing them to be oppressive to women and part of the auditing, measuring culture that contributes to stress and feelings of inadequacy. 

anyway, i got this scale and i stood on it and sure as day, i was 234 lbs. in my wildest imaginings of where my weight had gotten to, this was a distant number. i immediately took to the NHS BMI calculator and there it was: BMI of 32.7 (i'm a tall human), you're obese baby. for the first couple of days i was in denial - i googled things like 'i don't look obese but BMI says i'm obese'. in my head, obese people looked like my aunt or lizzo. at the same time, i was also still struggling against the fat acceptance narratives in my head: i'm obese, isn't this something i should celebrate or something? literally it makes no sense to me now but that is something i genuinely thought. i'm not exaggerating. so after a couple of days of denial, peppered with anger and dispair, i was just like: yeah i'm gonna have to fix this. i figured out that i needed to lose 56 pounds to get to a 'healthy' BMI. when i told my wife this was the amount of weight i had to lose she was like shiiiiiiit. but she never doubted me. so here is how i did it: 

**how i lost 56 lbs in 5 months:**

Step One: 

i quit alcohol. forever. i stopped drinking on september 13, and my wife did too. i don't say this like it's easy for people, but it's hands-down the most important and best thing i've ever done for myself. i'm not gonna go on about the joys of being tee-total in this post (it belongs to another post probably) but there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind that cutting out alcohol was one of the key reasons i was able to lose the weight i did. i also feel literally incomparably happier than i ever have in my adult life.  i still smoke weed - couple of tokes a night - so i don't consider myself sober, but alcohol poisoned my belief in myself and my body and i knew if i wanted to take my health seriously it needed to go. 

Step Two: 

i quit animal products, as did my wife. a week after i quit drinking, i decided to go vegan. at first i was still eating honey but that's gone now too. again, hate to be evangelical about this, but it made my body feel healthier than it ever has in my adult life. coupled with zero-alcohol, i started having the energy of like, my 9-year-old self. my skin youthened by about 5 years. seriously, my wife and i were like WE HAVE BENJAMIN BUTTONED OURSELVES WHAT IS HAPPENING. In the first two months of no booze and being vegan, weight melted off me. From 5 October to 29 November, I lost 19 pounds. i was exercising too, but not like crazy. nothing more intense than what i had been doing before, which was running about 3 times a week. 

Step Three: 

i started actually drinking water. didn't do that before, quite literally couldn't understand the point (so alienated from my body and its needs). anyway, i started drinking at least two litres a day and it seemed to help everything on its way. also, my pee smelled better. win! 

Step Four: 

i unplugged from the internet. i deleted facebook and eventually instagram. this was an important part of my weight loss journey because i hadn't realised how susceptible i was to group think, and how disciplining social media was about what constitutes a morally good life or decision. unplugging from social media feeds allowed me to start thinking for myself, and spending more time in nature. that said, i compensated for my lack of feeds by getting heavily into youtube. obese to beast (john glaude) \*really\* helped me. i got super into his videos and started to understand that, actually, as an anti-capitalist, i was doing worse for the world by supporting the overproduction of food - and the nutritional crisis of obesity that unfolds from it - than by self-flagellating for wanting a smaller body. 

Step Five: 

after the initial weight came off, i had to develop a more serious strategy. first thing i did was actually log my calories. i used my fitness pal for this and it worked well, although i never weighed my food. so a lot of it was eyeballing/guess-work. i got round this by slightly overestimating amounts so that i could insulate myself from disappointment! anyway, without my fitness pal i would never have worked out that actually olive oil isn't inherently good for you. prior to this i would happily use a cup of oil in a salad dressing. so i started switching things out and becoming a bit more inventive: i would use vinegar bases for dressings, and use tahini to thicken it up instead. 

Step Six: 

i started doing body-weight training instead of running. this was partly because i ran too much one week and gave myself a hip flexor injury. so instead, i started doing HIITs and lots of planks, bridges and the like in the park in the morning. this made my body feel strong and i think sped up my metabolism. eventually, i mixed bodyweight training and running during the week.

Step Seven: 

i committed to a daily morning practice of food, movement and meditation. without alcohol I was able to go to sleep more easily and wake up more easily. as a result, I was able to gradually get to morning wake-ups at 6am (i had NEVER been a morning person because of alcohol and anxiety but had always dreamt of being one). i have eaten the same breakfast every morning for five months: oatmeal with agave and either half an apple or blueberries. in some ways i credit oatmeal for being my gateway drug to a healthy life. oatmeal powers me up and 45 minutes after eating it, i started going out and exercising, followed by a few minutes of meditation. this routine allowed me to start my day intentionally and with kind words to myself. 

Step Eight: 

i ate a cheat meal at least once a week. often this was a proper cheat meal, e.g. vegan fried chicken burger, giant cookie, fries, soda. i continue to do this every friday and the only thing that's changed is that, as my body gets healthier, i actually have much less desire to eat oily food. still, for me it's been important to have an evening of semi-indulgence. 

Step Nine: 

i stopped eating virtually any processed food and snacks, especially any with added sugar. i thought this would be harder than it was, but i managed it through swapping things out. i ate corn cakes and kallo spinach pesto cakes with vegan pate; i ate a lot of fruit and seeds; i would have like, only one biscuit rather than 25. 

Step Ten: 

i ate loads of fibre. this is easy to do when you're plant-based, but i also went for way more fibrous carbs. i starting making brown rice, sweet potato or quinoa my carb base, and eating it with loads of tempeh or tofu, tahini-based sauces and dressings, lots of green veggies like broccoli and spinach. tbh this is the food i love anyway, so i always felt satiated and satisfied. this diet hugely helped me exercise - i would never feel sleepy after meals (had just thought this was what happened to everyone after eating), and instead would feel energised. almost like... food can be fuel? 

Step Eleven: 

i incorporated movement into my work day. this one was hard because my job is frigging nuts right now, with teaching loads effectively doubled, if not tripled, by online delivery. i got a fitness watch which told me to stand up every hour and showed me how sedentary i was. again, hadn't realised this - really thought that running 3 times a week would somehow compensate for me sitting or lying down 90% of the time. so i started with the standing and then i did some walking at lunchtime, only a few minutes or so. i found this to be pretty boring so i got a LONGBOARD. this was a cheap board i found on ebay. i hate competitive sports and live on Plague Island so doing something solo that wasn't HIIT training or running sounded perfect. i started learning how to longboard in early February and now do that at lunchtime, when i can. i listen to miley cyrus and skate around the park feeling like the coolest 32-year-old in the world. 

Step Twelve: 

by the end of february i had started to plateau. initially this freaked me out but then i went back to treating myself like an interesting science experiment. so i dealt with plateaus through a combination of a) increasing my cardio - in particular, running and jumping more, hip-willing; and b) cutting back on oil. i had started to eat stuff like coconut oil, avocado oil, rapeseed oil - all of which are in vegan foods like pip &amp; nut almond butter, vegan mayo and store-bought hummus. by cutting back - not necessarily eliminating entirely - and doing a bit more cardio, i was able to continue to lose weight. often this was no more than a pound a week but a pound's a pound bitch! 

Step Thirteen: 

i treated weight loss like a degree. i got curious, fascinated, data-driven; i became a scholar of my own adiposity. i made charts that eventually became a spreadsheet, tracking my loss alongside my exercise habits of the month. i mapped out my menstrual cycle and read my weight loss alongside this information (i kept retaining or putting on weight during my period which initially stumped me until i remembered that obviously bodies change then they're menstruating). i consumed HUNDREDS of youtube videos about weight loss; i also listened to podcasts from the other side of the fence, i.e. intuitive eating, health at every size, fat acceptance. i came to the conclusion that the western world - nay the world in its entirety - is in some kind of nihilistic denial that will end in an apocalyptic mukbang while pharmaceutical, food-industry, and petrochemical companies fill their pockets. i also came to the conclusion that yes, obviously the people who are pumped full of the excess sugars and fats attendant upon the over-production of food are often the poorest. i also came to the conclusion that celebrating this is FUCKED UP, and that we should all be very, very angry about it. 

Step Fourteen: 

i talked about weight loss with the people that i know care about me, i.e. my mum, dad, sister, wife, and 1-2 friends. i shared what i was trying to do and how i felt about it. this was totally out of character for me as i had been so against intentional weight loss for so long. i embraced the delicious slice of humble pie and 'i was wrong in the past' accountability that this offered me, while offering a new path to deepening my relationships with those close to me, through the vulnerability of being open about body struggles. 

&amp;#x200B;

anyway i think that's everything. the main things, at least. still hoping to cut down by another 5-10 pounds so i have more wiggle room for my weekend indulgences but other than that, yeah keep going! you'll get there, bit by bit. and as miley sings: 

'Ain't about how fast I get there  
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side  
It's the climb' 

IT'S THE CLIMB EVERYBODY!"
"Weight loss stalls can be so frustrating! Hey everyone! I need some peace of mind. I have lost 14lb since the start of December. I am 29F 5ft2 sw:203 cw:189 gw:150. I eat 1450 calories a day and have been honestly and religiously tracking this. I weigh everything and try to drink at least 3L a day. For the past three weeks my weight has not budged an inch. I have had some NSV’s recently like fitting into trousers and dresses I haven’t for ages so I know there is definitely progress. I have one of those scales that does loads of body measurements and I know that they aren’t exactly accurate however there is some indication my body fat has decreased over those weeks. For exercise I try to get 10000 steps a day through dog walking. I just need to know I am doing the right thing and if anyone has any words of wisdom which might help get me through this stall! Also do you think it is a stall or could I be going wrong somewhere? 
Thanks in advance!"
"I'm not seeing any progress and I feel worthless Hello all! I'm new to this subreddit but I have been trying to lose weight on and off for like 3 years now. I lose it, put it on, lose it and so on. This quarantine I put on too many kilos and after crash dieting and binging every night I felt like shit. I started searching and searching and learned a lot about how my body works. I have tried loosing weight in a healthy way for three weeks. I am eating enough for my body and go for runs 3 times a week and exercise at home (push ups, crunches, leg raises, flexibility etc) but I haven't seen ANY change. I do feel generally better (like I have my life together) but I feel worthless for not making any progress. 
Has anyone else been through a phase like this? Where you feel you're doing everything correctly, but don't make progress? How did you get out of it?"
"Please read this if you are a healthy teenager looking to lose weight 14f here, I was in your position in July. I was at a healthy weight at the 50th percentile, but I wanted to lose weight because I was dissastisfied with my body. I tried to make it about loving and taking care of myself, but deep down I knew I was driven by self hatred. I started counting calories and limiting myself to 1200 calories each day. It was hard at first, but slowly I found ways to eat less and less. Before I knew it, I was eating 900, then 800. Nobody noticed until I told my mom I needed some new pants because I ""hadn't been eating due to stress"". Shortly after this, I spiraled into full blown severe anorexia. I ended up in the hospital in October. Now I'm in quasi-recovery, I gained 9 pounds then stopped and I'm lying to my family because I'm terrified of gaining more weight.

I know if I had seen a post like this in July I would have completely ignored it, so I don't really know if I will help anyone, but please see a doctor if you are interested in losing weight before you change anything. If you are at a healthy weight already, you are probably absolutely fine the way you are. Not eating enough can really damage your brain and body, even if it's not a huge caloric deficit. 

If you are going to do it anyway without consulting a doctor and/or your parents, PLEASE look out for some warning signs I should have paid attention to:

\- Constant body checking

\- Wanting to eat less and less every day and feeling successful if I ate less

\- Being at war with myself if I ate more than I had planned

\- Thinking that I had do wait until I was thin to do certain things or wear certain clothes

\- Prioritizing weight loss over everything and obsessing about it

\- Constant food thoughts

And if you experience ANY of these things or something else you're not sure about, please please tell someone IMMEDIATELY before there is a chance for it to get bad. You don't need to wait for it to get bad or to become an emergency to seek help, and you are far more likely to bounce back if you do talk to someone early.

Please don't try to lose weight if you are healthy already: [https://www.bcm.edu/cnrc-apps/bodycomp/bmiz2.html](https://www.bcm.edu/cnrc-apps/bodycomp/bmiz2.html)

Instead, figure out what you think you will gain from losing weight. 

Confidence? Try to make peace with your body, get a haircut, please do not try to lose weight.

Strength/fitness? Do more exercise, build muscle.

Health? Please consult a doctor to find out if weight loss is actually healthy for you.

Thanks for reading, I hope that this helps you. I know you might be really insecure or think losing weight will make you feel better about yourself, but please be really really careful."
"Relationships feel empty and people treat me different after weight loss I hope this fits here, I think it does as it's directly related to my losing weight and I think others may experience it as well, if I'm mistaken, my apologies.  


 

I lost a fair bit of weight in my recent years (80lbs or so), I'm a 20yo man.

(context)  I went from what other people would probably call a 3 or 4 to.. maybe a  7? Idk girls ask me out, I'm 6'3 and slightly muscular even though I  hold some weight on my face.

Anyways,  all of my relationships, romantic and friendships (especially with  women) are completely different now. Even men treat me different, I get  picked for group projects, people ask me for advice, I'm just included  in the rest of the world when I wasn't before... Everything feels super  shallow, I went on tinder and got 20x my matches from when I first  tried, and it made me feel disgusted. Its like my entire value as a  person was down to my weight, or my weight stopped people from seeing  anything in value from me before. I went a date with an older friend  from a little after highschool and she made a comment  ""you're  completely *different*, it's so good\*"". I haven't changed since then, I just lost weight. Its still me\*.

It  sucks realizing that everyone who will be with you wouldn't give you  the time of day before, and would return to not giving you the time of  day if you gained it back. Dating feels so incredibly shallow, before I  lost the weight I blamed myself for being unsuccessful, and after losing  the weight I just see the worst in everyone.

I was wondering if anyone else had experiences similar to mine, and how you dealt with it?"
"The cost of bad habits and weight regain Long story short: I lost 70 lbs a few years ago, and over the last few months, regained back 20 of that. Back to being solidly ""overweight"". I'm a shorter female, and I'd really started getting used to being slimmer and healthier finally, so even regaining a fraction of the original weight has made a HUGE negative impact.

The bad side effects that suddenly reappeared JUST after my relapse: Back pain. Knee pain. Foot pain. Acid reflux. Bladder incontinence. Flatulence (sorry, gross TMI but it's real). Facial acne, and just in general my face and skin looks puffy and terrible. Feeling weak pretty much constantly low on energy. Needing more sleep, yet feeling less refreshed. Mood swings, depression, and anxiety greatly worsened.

I'd completely forgotten, or maybe didn't even notice, all the changes that changing my diet and losing weight made. Some probably just from what I eat, being a bit more active, and some of it from the extra pressure and weight on my body. It's really made me appreciate the importance of a healthier lifestyle.

So I have always wanted to donate my body to science when I die. Since I was a little kid and I found out about body farms and cadavers. As someone who doesn’t believe in god or an afterlife it seems like a great way to be useful and live on after death. 

Well guess what? If I were to die today I couldn’t be donated to any science programs. Most medical schools have a weight limit of 250 and height limit of 6” 4’. There is a body farm in my state that does go up to 300 but unfortunately I am just above that. This seriously broke my heart. I know it must seem silly for some to care about such a thing but for me its a massive deal. I don’t plan on making an early exit but If something did happen I want to know I could be used for good instead of just worm food. 

So now when people ask me what’s my motivation for losing weight I will tell them it’s so I can be donated to science lol."
"Benefits you have noticed after losing weight? I know topics like this come up from time to time, but I like reading them when I am unmotivated and I have not seen a topic like this posted in a while. What Are some clear benefits you have noticed after losing some weight?

I am 21 year old male, who have been overweight for the most part of my life. I managed to lose some weight in 2015/2016, but this last year or so I have gained 20+ pounds. I have never been truly lean and I have always been over my ideal weight, but this time I am more focused since I know I have managed to lose some of it. But I know I need to lose more of it now since I had a BMI at 30-ish when I started. I have so far lost 3-4 kg or so this last 40-50 days or so. But right now I am feeling very unmotivated and I need some motivation to keep going. Any help appreciated! Love this community!

21 male start weight was 90 kg (198 lbs) and now I am at 86-87 (190-191 lbs). My goal weight I am still not sure of, but I think less than 75 kg (165 lbs). My goal now is to be 80 kg (176 lbs) by the begining of june."
"On the way to reaching a major fat loss goal at 52! Hi! First post here! I'm female, almost 52, 5'4"" and my current weight is 166 lbs. I started at 238 lbs in March 2019 and my goal is to reach 140 lbs by the beginning of this September.

I found an unwavering motivation to deal with obesity and change my lifestyle permanently after receiving a diagnosis of mild non-alcoholic fatty liver 2 years ago. I spent my pandemic isolation (I live alone) making getting healthy my main focus. I read and watched a lot on the subject, and seriously focused on what I needed to change in my life. (I was also dealing with depression and anxiety at the time I began my journey).

My changes to date have been almost completely diet-related. I removed most processed food and all forms of sugar from my apartment. I cooked one-pot meals and froze them in individual portion sizes so something healthy was always available when I needed it. I made big multi-ingredient salads and kept them in the fridge to grab during the week. I switched to a diet of vegetables, whole grains, beans and legumes, fruit (mostly berries), all kinds of nuts and seeds, frozen and canned salmon, canned tuna, chicken and turkey (white meat), and sometimes extra-lean ground beef when I really wanted a hamburger! (I still haven't been able to open that tin of sardines, haha). I learned to bake whole grain bread. Anything I made was weighed for calories/portion size. I'm lactose intolerant and finally cut out dairy. I figured out which other types of foods were causing my IBS symptoms (also diagnosed in March 2019) and cut them, too. It was a process. I aimed to stay in a range of 1200-1500 calories a day and kept track of what I was eating in a food diary, especially to see where I was falling short nutrition-wise, and most of the time I needed to increase the number of veggies I ate. I didn't order anything from restaurants because I wanted to make sure I knew what I was eating. (I don't drink so I didn't need to consider that issue.) I also compiled a binder over time of healthy recipes I actually loved that I knew fit my caloric requirements. I take an Omega 3 supplement and much vitamin D3, as well as calcium if I don't drink enough non-dairy milk in a day to reach 1200 mg. Oh, I should also mention that many of the meals I cook are hot and spicy because for me it just makes eating healthy so much tastier!

The other important aspect has been positive self-regard. I have been gentle with myself and included the expectation that dips in my progress would be part of the process from the outset. If I plateaued, I just told myself that things would start to move again, and focused on eating healthy. If I felt like eating more I did, and I would literally say (out loud) to myself that 'of course you can have more food!'. After a while, my sugar cravings, which were A HUGE HUGE HUGE issue for me, disappeared. Visiting family for holidays etc. was (and is) a challenge but I'm so focused on my goal that I have been able to stay on my plan.

So the great news is -- I went for an ultrasound last week and my liver is now completely normal!  I am soooo happy and relieved! My new goal this spring is to gradually replace most of my calorie deficit with exercise so that I can eat an amount closer to a maintenance weight. I have started a walking/eventually running program, and have a goal to add weight training and some yoga later on.  I would really like to find a group I can go hiking with once group activities are allowed again! 

The last 2 years have been a time of major transition for me. This September, at the point at which I hope to reach my fat loss goal, I will be starting a research MA! So excited!! Although I'm 51, my lifestyle is definitely on par with that of a broke student but I love it. My depression is gone. If it returns, I'll continue to be gentle with myself. Anxiety will always be part of my life. 

I'm happy I found this subreddit! Thanks for reading my story. I wish you nothing but the best in reaching your own goals. It takes courage to change."
"I was so certain I'd never be this weight again. And I was wrong. I'm 28F, 5'1"", and as of today, I weigh 187.8 pounds. I feel awful and hate the way I look. I have no energy or motivation for anything. I'm so upset with myself for letting it get this bad.

In 2017, I got up to my old HW of 174 pounds. I felt awful then and decided to start counting calories again and to go for more walks. Over the next couple of years, I very slowly lost around 30 pounds and felt great. I still wanted to lose some more weight to get into a healthy BMI and feel even better about myself, but I was really happy with my progress. I successfully lost weight and kept from gaining it back for around 2.5 years and I was certain I'd never see my HW ever again. But, as I'm sure is the case with many other people here, I could not predict the toll that a pandemic would take on my mental health and motivation.

I did pretty well for the first few months of the pandemic. I had gained a few pounds over Christmas and gained a few more going into the summer, but I was still exercising and trying to eat fairly normally. Around June or July, a switch flipped – perhaps that was the moment that it really sank in that the pandemic wasn't just going to go away in a few weeks. I went crazy, eating everything I'd ever craved and then some. I stopped counting calories after the numbers from my binges started to make me feel awful about myself. I stopped exercising, both out of laziness and out of fear of getting too close to other people outside. I kept telling myself I'd have one last day/weekend/week/month of binge eating and *then* I'd start over. I did this despite knowing that those thoughts are a trap and rarely turn out to be true. I did it all despite knowing that I'd end up where I am now, obese again and feeling worse about myself than I ever have before.

So here I am now, nearly 15 pounds above my last highest weight. Not only did I see those numbers again, but I surpassed them. As the scale has crept towards 190 pounds, I've realized that 200 isn't that far out of reach. I can hold a few cans of soup while standing on the scale and easily see 200 at the end of the day (I know because I tried). I always told myself that I'd never let myself get to this point no matter what – that if I ever neared 200, the numbers would be a wake-up call that made me turn my life around. It doesn't feel as clear-cut as I thought it would, almost like I've become numb to the numbers. Maybe it's just easier to see higher numbers when it's a slow rise from one day to the next. Either way, I'm not happy and I can't continue like this. My options are to either stay on my current path and end up morbidly obese and even more miserable, or to make changes now and work on being healthier.

Starting today, I'm tracking all my calories again. I'm going to ease into it – this week, I'm not going to stick to a budget so strictly, just track and notice the patterns. Next week, I'll start trying more seriously to stay under budget. It's the end of the day now, but I'm going to start going for walks again starting tomorrow. This is a big step for me – recently, I've been feeling so horrible about how I look now that I've been afraid to go out for walks in case someone sees me. But I know that's ridiculous. I know no one judges me as harshly as I judge myself and that the only way I can be active and feel better about myself again is to get back to the activity that I used to enjoy the most around a year ago. In a few weeks, I'll also start to incorporate some bodyweight workouts again. I'm going to cut out alcohol (which always makes me feel like crap anyway) and slowly start to cut down on processed foods.

I'm basically going to do everything I did last time. I think I did everything pretty well before. Losing the weight slowly through small changes is what made it so sustainable, and I believe it would have been sustainable long-term had the pandemic not happened. I felt like I could have sustained my lifestyle throughout any type of hardship, but, like most people, I didn't think something like the last year would even be possible.

I've had enough crisps, chocolate, pizza, McDonald's, and chips over the past year to last me a good long time. I'll still eat those foods occasionally, but I can definitely stand to stop eating them every day from here on out. Here's to the next weeks, months, and years ahead.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to get some steps in before it's time to go to sleep!"
"I’m trying my best I just pushed myself to go out for a walk and while on my walk there was a kid with someone and they yelled “fatty”. The person along with them told them “omg you’re so rude” and as I kept walking the kids voice echoed “fat fat fattyyyy!!” You never know what people are going through. I have no one to tell this to because everytime I’m fat shamed in public my mom thinks I’m lying or I’m exaggerating the situation. Yes I am fat and I’m trying my best to become healthy. I’ve been eating at home and cooking my own meals alongside trying to be more active. 

Things like this just put me in a deep depression and discourage me from even trying. It’s hard enough. I’m obese so I’m starting out with simple walking until I’m physically able to do more than that. I know people say why do you care so much what people think? It’s not even caring about people it’s the aspect of being called words that have a negative connotation. They just make you feel like less of a person in society. It does hurt. No matter your weight we are still human and we’re trying our best. I’m trying my best."

"60 day IF streak broken.... for waffles with garlic salt. My 8 year old caught me looking at super tasty breakfast items today that I was trying to modify to keep the tastiness and maybe cut back on the calories a smidge. I was thinking breakfast for dinner next week. She ""snuck"" into the kitchen and in a super secret super noisy way fixed me a surprise. 

It was 2 pieces of toast with garlic salt and birthday cake waffles with cool whip and extra seasoning (also garlic salt- so much garlic salt) the plate was only complete with a smattering of goldfish (also extra seasoned with garlic salt) around it to make it look like a four leaf clover for luck. 🥰

So... today isnt going ideal as far as my diet and my calories and my IF. I mean I could make adjustments to make it work later on, but I am not. My heart is as full as my belly right now. And I think it's important to learn  remember balance. 

I loved my garlic salt waffles even if it wasnt what I expected to need this morning. So instead of the 60 day streak accountability post I was debating, I'm just gonna remember to slow down and enjoy it a bit too.

"NSV - I No Longer Hate Doctors! I'm sure most everyone on this sub can relate to how humiliating and shameful it is to see a doctor when you're overweight or obese. The first time I cried at a doctor's office was when I was 12 years old and the doctor told me that the darkened skin on my neck and inner elbows was a warning sign for developing diabetes. She was very kind and offered me helpful solutions to get my weight under control but I was terrified to think that the disease that killed my grandma might be in my future. A pattern developed after that: I'd go to the doctor, be told that my weight was dangerous and I was getting sicker, I'd try to lose weight, be successful for a while, and then go back to old habits. Rinse and repeat.

It wasn't until I was about 22 or 23 that it finally hit me that I was headed down a dangerous path. I'd reached 400 pounds, was pre diabetic, my blood pressure was climbing, and I had sleep apnea. I knew within a year, maybe less, I'd be diabetic, on blood pressure medication, and using a CPAP machine. And I was in my early 20s! Funnily enough, as much as I had grown to hate doctors, it was doctors that ended up scaring me enough to take charge of my health.

I had gastric bypass when I was 24 years old. I completely changed my lifestyle, started counting my calories, exercising, and working closely with a dietitian and exercise trainer. My hard work paid off and two and a half years later I'm down 276 pounds.

I had my first doctor's appointment last week since reaching my goal weight and for the first time I wasn't scared. I wasn't uncomfortable. I wasn't ashamed. The MA put the blood pressure cuff on my arm, saw the 110/60 and said ""wow, that's really good."" I stepped on the scale and wasn't brought to tears by the weight that popped up. The doctor felt around my abdomen and said ""I thought your liver might be a bit enlarged but it's not, you're just so skinny now."" The lab technician drew my blood and instead of having to to poke me five times because my arms were so covered in fat and I was dehydrated, she got me easily on the first try, said my blood was flowing really well because of how hydrated I was, and made a comment about my ""teeny tiny arm"" when she was wrapping me up. My blood tests came back and everything is normal. 

Sure, I enjoy the way I look now. I like how I feel in smaller clothes. But the greatest gift I've given myself is the gift of health. I'm no longer afraid of diseases or dying as a result of my weight. I know I have a long life ahead of me and this doctor's appointment has helped me take a hard look at my accomplishments, which I don't do enough. 

I'll probably never love doctors but it's such a gift to no longer live in fear of seeing them!"

"Think there is something wrong with my body. Hi everyone, I’ve been working out for 8 weeks now, 7 days a week. My workouts are usually 30 mins of strength training and 30 minutes of HIIT training on my peloton. In the last 54 days I have had around 6 rest days, some of which were active recovery (going for a long work or a leisure cycle or some yoga). I was sick with sinusitis and still worked out.  

In this time I’ve eaten between 1700-2000 calories, the past 3 weeks have been closer to 2000 calories because I’m getting kind of annoyed with everything and I’m adopting a little bit of a fuck it mentality because I’m frustrated. 

In this time I have definitely gotten stronger, I am beating personal bests, I’ve developed mad determination but I haven’t achieved ANY fat loss. I have some silly body fat scale (we know how inaccurate those things can be), I have apparently lost 3% body fat, gained 3kg of muscle and my visceral fat has gone down from 10 to 7. The scale has shifted from 82 to 80.5 in 8 weeks. Not even 4lbs? All these stats sound great but my waist measurement has not changed by one inch and I still look exactly the same, I feel stronger and I am breaking personal records but my body has not changed. 

I’m only trying to lose the last 10kg and with intense daily exercise my maintenance cals should be around 2500, even in my “bad” 2k cal day should still result in a deficit. Im very endowed in the boob area which does feel a little lighter but apart from that nothing has changed even with all my hard work and I’m now getting to a really dark place. I didn’t even have the initial fast weight loss people get, what is wrong with my body? 

I’m on the brink of pulling my hair out and I know there are some really knowledgable people in this community. My stats are 22F, 80.5kg, 174cm (5’8.5). BFP: 26.6%. BMI is 26. Bone mass is Waist is 33 inches. Trying to lose 10kg of fat the right way which is why I’m making sure I’m doing strength to maintain/gain muscle while I lose fat. Sick and tired"

"I'm at the brink of giving up my new healthy lifestyle Hey guys,
I'm a 30yr old guy (172cm in height) and I'm at the brink of just giving up. For 8 weeks now I count every calorie taken, burnt and I carefully chose what I eat.
I'm doing exercises every 2 days and doing my 10k steps every day.

Yet I have seen some results the first 3 weeks and since then my weight loss came to a complete halt. I even gained a kilogram. I've not seen a gram drop from my weight for 5 weeks now and I just wanna give up. I eat 1500 calories a day which means that I should have a deficit of around 500-600kcal.

Just wanted to write and get it off my soul, that I'm one of those persons that haven't successfully beaten their habits and gave up."

"It's about Dieting AND lifestyle changes This was a big realisation for me. I used to think that you nearly had to be on a permanent diet if you wanted to be healthy...which depressed me. 

Dieting alone won't cut it. If you want to maintain your weight you need to make small changes in your life so that calories in = calories out. If you want to lose weight go on a diet. 

Easier said than done but I have found that dieting alone is not enough. I focus a lot more of my energy on my lifestyle than regularly going on diets now. That being said, I always go on a diet for the month of January so I can enjoy Christmas!

Hope this helps anyone who is getting fed up of dieting. It has helped me."
"The Hunger.. So, I've lost a lot of weight. Close to 70 pounds since this time last year. I've had issues with yo-yo dieting in the past, I've been making sure to go slower this time and make it sustainable.

Now, I'm in a healthy weight range. On the last ten pounds. Holy hell, this past month...the inability to feel satiated. It's unlike anything I've had while dieting now or in the past. I've implemented diet breaks throughout my process, however, now even that isn't helping. I'm wondering if I need to make them last longer, maybe instead of 3-5 days, 7-10? Those have been helpful mentally and getting rid of this in the past, but now, not so much.

I mean, seriously. I had a couple of bad days I just...I ate good fats, fiber and protein, higher volume food, and still after 3-4k+ calories (need around 2300 to maintain) it wasn't enough. I still found myself fixating about food as if I had just ran 20 miles and hadn't eaten in two days. I drink plenty of water, with my activity level a gallon a day on average. I also have been doing IF.

So, I'm lost. Is...is this life now? I can't imagine maintaining like this. Coping before wasn't great but still fairly easy eating the right things. Yeah, a twinge of hunger here and there but that is to be expected. I genuinely can't describe what it has become, other than the bane of my existence and the most annoying shit ever. Has anyone else gone through this, after getting to/close to a healthy weight range or after dieting for so long? I figure one of those is the culprit, but I don't know. If so, how did you overcome it, or at least make it manageable? Thank you!

TLDR: Lost a lot of weight, working on last 10 pounds and now have excess hunger/the inability to feel satiated or full from hell. Want advice on how to ease that."
"Gym tips for someone terrified to go to the gym? Soooo I’ve been doing at-home workouts for 127 days lmao. The only reason I know that is because I asked Siri haha. 
I’m 5’3” and went from 151 to 135 pounds, and have gotten considerably stronger. I only have 10 lb weights at my house but think I should go up to 12 lbs. I also want to gain some muscle in my back, arms, and butt that I don’t think I’m really getting at home. 
The gym makes me nervous because of the people, the fact that idk how to create a work out routine, and idk how to use most of the machines lol. Plus I’m an 18 yo female so going to the gym by myself seems scary in general.

"215lb down to 185, back up to 200 now and losing hope I can't get back on track. I've had so many false re-starts. 

I lost all my weight on a program called Optavia. I'm off the program now because I don't want to shell out $400/month anymore. I also don't want to have painful stomach cramps and awful gas for another month. I was able to stick to it enough to lose 30lb, and was okay with that tradeoff. But it's NOT sustainable, and my wife was legit worried &amp; bothered my stomach issues.

Transitioning from Optavia into whole foods has proven to be SUPER hard for me. When left to my own devices, I overeat and I don't count calories. I'm just busy working and eat/snack all the time to soothe my anxiety and stress.

I wish I could just get back on track. The frustrating part is I know what to do but just can't get in the right mindset and STICK TO IT. I need to start meal planning and preparing for those inevitable cravings, but every night like fucking clockwork I crave sweets, popcorn, chocolate covered pretzels, ice cream, you name it. All the bullshit food that adds no value to my life. It just makes me upset and shameful.

What's worked for you to get back on track? I'm losing hope."

"How was your day today? My day was a bit stressful, as I just started school again and I didn't know what to expect, or what things will be like when I went back. Adding on to that, I was debating so much wether I should do a workout today, 
because I wasn't feeling it, I felt tired,stressed,nervous, anxious. Etc.
 And these things make me feel weak like I haven't archived anything,and that just brings me down a lot. At the end I got myself together and did the workout and im proud of myself, because I feel great now.💪🏽😁
Im now going to start reading a bit before bed to clear my mind. I'm reading 'Do this for you' By Krissy Cela, im only 20 pages in and it's very good so far, I recommend.
That's me done.

"Running with LoseIt - 3/9/2021 - Running Gear I Use This is a 'weekly' post for the Runners of LoseIt. 

All  levels of runners are welcome -- from brand new first timers to experienced marathoners. Please feel free to come in and share, ask questions, whine, post NSVs (non-scale victories), etc. There are a lot  of great runners on this sub and lots of experience and help to share.  Plus, it is also more fun to share regularly how you are doing with  others going through the same challenges and experiences.

This post is mostly for sharing details of running this week, your first run, running related NSVs, questions, PRs, etc.

In  addition I will ramble on about some topic that is helpful to runners,  usually new runners, to help people along. This week -- running gear!

Running Gear

You really don't need much to go for a run, but there's a lot to be gained by adding a few running equipment, accessories, and tech. There's all sorts of things you can bring along on a run --

* Phone (and keys) Holder/Belt
* Headphones
* Watch or Tracker
* Heart Rate Monitor
* Stride/Form tech
* Running Power Meter

I'm going to talk about the top four items via my own choices. I've not widely tested any of this stuff, but I have arrived at stuff I really like and make running better for me.

I know, I know, it's fanny-pack-esque. But it has all the following things going for it -- 

* Holds a Phone + Keys + Credit Card/Money - ample, secure storage. 
* Hides easily under my shirt - It lays flat. I've tucked it under my shirt or in my shorts without issue.
* Adjustable  - set it to a point where it stays put and I will not budge for hours. 
* Comfortable - The elastic is wide and stretchy, never pinches. 
* Durable - mine is still going strong after 4+ years. 
* Reasonably priced.

# Headphones - Panasonic RP-HJE120-D Wired Ear Buds - Orange

* Cheap - $USD 9. 
* High Quality sound
* Different ear piece sizes for perfect fit
* Lots of great/fun colors -- like my favorite orange. 

I love music when I run. I enjoy solid sound quality, and like to turn it up nice and loud with excellent base. I've tried Bluetooth earbuds and they either work well, but are expensive (and I lose/break them in no time). Or, they are cheap and disconnect or have sound quality issues. Also, I don't need another thing to charge. I'm fine with wired ones but I know many aren't. I wear my wired ones with the wire running under my shirt. It can be bother when I am completely drenched with sweat -- but then again, I'm completed drenched at that point. 

I listen to music off an iPod Nano. It sounds great and is easy to operated on a run. It's light enough that it is not an issue in my pocket. I sometimes run sans phone -- so I can't use it for music reliably. 

# Watch/Tracker - Polar Vantage M

[https://www.polar.com/us-en/vantage/m](https://www.polar.com/us-en/vantage/m)

Polar is in the pack of second-runners in the running watch tech space after Garmin. I started with Polar and I've stuck with it. I like the Flow website and the simple, sport specific design of the product. 

Why do I like it -- 

* Ease of use - start a workout with a press and hold of a button most of the time. 
* Lots of sports profiles - I've used Running, Hiking, Walking, Indoor Rowing, Yoga, and Strength Training in the last 30 days. I've used 20 or so sports profiles over the last four years. 
* 5+ days on a charge. I hate charging stuff all the time. Nearly a week per charge is great for me. 
* Building workouts like Intervals/Repeats are easy and fast.
* Provide workout ideas if I am don't have a plan for the day -- suggests running more, strength training, or flexibility/core/support workouts and then provides the details and timing right on the watch. 
* Built in Running Training Plans for 5K, 10K, Half, Marathon. 
* Great support. I've had my Polar Watches have issues and got a free/hassle free replacements with what appears to be a new watch. 

If I had an Apple Watch I likely would use that over this but I enjoy the sport-centric nature of the Polar. 

# Heart Rate Monitor - Polar Chest Strap

[https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/h10\_heart\_rate\_sensor](https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/h10_heart_rate_sensor)

Chest heart rate monitors are way more stable than most other options. My one other go to is an arm (not wrist based) optical strap like the Polar OH1/2 Verity. But optical trackers are slow to track to your heart rate from my experiences. The chest strap is fast and tracks way quicker. 

There's lots of great choices in chest straps from Garmin and Wahoo and others.

"Day 1? Starting your weight loss journey on Wednesday, 10 March 2021? Start here! **Today is your Day 1?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Welcome to** r/Loseit!

&amp;#x200B;

So you aren’t sure of how to start?  Don’t worry!  “How do I get started?” is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we’ve found most useful for getting started.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why you’re overweight

&amp;#x200B;

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

&amp;#x200B;

# Before You Start

&amp;#x200B;

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

&amp;#x200B;

# Tracking

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don’t cheat the numbers.  You’ll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

&amp;#x200B;

# Creating Your Deficit

&amp;#x200B;

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what you’re eating you won’t stick to it.

&amp;#x200B;

# Exercise

&amp;#x200B;

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

It has it’s own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

&amp;#x200B;

# Crawl, Walk, Run

&amp;#x200B;

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isn’t necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

&amp;#x200B;

# Acceptance

&amp;#x200B;

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We don’t need perfect.  We just want better.

&amp;#x200B;

"Week 7 weigh in Hey 



I 25 F 5ft 3inches SW 237.6lbs CG 185lbs just weighed in at 226lbs . I didnt lose anything physically but mentally iv had break throughs this week.






Il explain why not losing anything isnt a big deal its one week . i will lose weight hopefully next week i will but im relaxed about it . Mainly as its a lifestyle change not a race .






Its not a big deal as iv had a couple break throughs the last week that kinda just hit me . I want to share as im fcking proud of myself .





1) I broke up with feeling guilty about thinking , wanting , craving , making and eating/not eating . Im not going to feel guilty bout it anymore as its pointless . I have to eat to live  its how humans fuel our bodys its that simple . But i want to enjoy food again eat what i like , love and crave with no guilt so i if i want cake il track it and amend my day to fit it in as why not . 





2) I realised i have created routine in my life of being a housewife ( not married tho ) . I should say for years we have been unsettled with lifes been hectic due to outside influence but now we are very settled and calm . I started by making a list of daily cleaning tasks then weekly and more rare tasks like every few months . Iv stuck to it since the start of the year . And a couple weeks ago i started zone cleaning to get to those cleaning jobs we forget or put off . I feel like a proper adult for once as my house is getting a deeper clean than ever before . And iv stuck to my new laundry system.





3) I i decided to only control what i can control . Due to sharona issue i cant learn to drive but i can make daily habits so when i do learn and i finally get a job il be prepared. So every dang day i shower ,  brush hair , clean teeth do skin care ( due to a bad day I might of  missed a day a week but i havent since i started posting here ) then i put on the jewellery that iv always said when  i work il wear it daily so i am and finally i put slippers on i know there not close to shoes but close enough to form the habit .





Slowly slowly im forming new habits i now only drink water ,  i choose to get up and do my workouts even if im swearing at myself for it . I always said this is a lifestyle change so that includes healthy habits and thoughts .




Iv also choose  my march goal which is simple to be GRATEFUL for the food i have . I might not have much money but im privileged to be able to afford  acquire and prepare food . Im going to be more grateful that i can do all that . Btw im not religious.





Sorry for the length of this.

If you managed to read this thank you !!!

I do wonder if anyone reads what i post tho ."
"I’ve lost a combine total of 112kg in the last 6 years, my story. Some stats before I begin:

[March 2021:](https://i.imgur.com/DtLCnas.jpg) [98.5kg/216.7lbs](https://i.imgur.com/49SArMS.jpg) 

Today is my anniversary of when I first got serious with dieting and losing weight, so I thought it would be a good idea to share my journey so far and the lessons I've learnt over the last 6 years. Before I saw success though I struggled with losing weight for over 5 years, always having bursts of motivation to act or grand fantasies of impossible situations occurring that would fix my problems. Diets never lasted more than a week. 

In March 2015, after some challenging goals in my life turned out not so hard to accomplish, I decided to try losing weight for longer than a week. As each week passed I progressively got more involved in the process; starting using MyFitnessPal, clean eating, no soda and signed up to a gym. It was surreal and I thought I was unstoppable. 

In the 8 months of losing 40kg/88lbs I had been extremely strict on myself, so strict that food was not enjoyable. There was no creativity or variance, I was just on the grind waiting to reach my goal weight with weekly weigh-ins and my food logging streak keeping me in check. So inevitably it all started to fall apart.

The first big hit was losing my 180 day streak on MyFitnessPal. Next I was just slowly adding back soda into my diet, not sugar free but the full stuff. After that I stumbled and started to yoyo between 106kg/233lbs and 110kg/242lbs, and slowly and surely the difference got higher and it became harder to bring myself to lose weight again. I eventually stopped weighing myself and started to slowly reintroduce all the bad food I had deprived myself of. It snowballed, slowly undoing all the good that I had done. It then reached a point where I stopped caring and I ballooned to 158kg/348lbs by August 2018. Nowhere during this point of time did I address my core issues with food and what I used it for, nor did I really know at the time what those issues were.  

Come one Saturday morning in August after having a 7 day streak ordering takeout I weighed myself and saw 157.9kg/348lbs and I knew I never wanted to see myself ever reach 160kg/352lbs and again picked myself up and started trying to lose weight again. Steeling myself and fought through the inner turmoil and torture of failing at something I had previously succeeded in. Parents were worried as they saw the patterns, this was just another “burst of motivation” and in a week I’d be back to old habits. But I went beyond a week, then it was a month and by Nov 2018 I was down to 144kg/317lbs

However I was just repeating what failed before, I had gone back to old tactics when I lost that 14kg/31lbs. No Soda, No Takeout, No Fun. So when a small vacation happened in November 2018 where there would be takeout, soda and fun I was hit with a dilemma. I came to a decision to just enjoy myself for the couple days away and get back on task after it. However that never happened and I fell again and just like that I was on my way back to 158kg/348lbs. By mid-February 2019 I was 147kg/323lbs, doomed to be in this never ending loop till I had an epiphany; Why was I trying so hard? Why was I trying to be perfect at losing this weight? It was clearly failing. Why don’t I just take it slow?

March and the anniversary of starting this back in 2015 was fast approaching and I had the brilliant idea of competing with my former self but I knew I couldn’t be as strict, I knew I had to take this easy. So I tried losing weight with as little stress as possible. I guesstimated calories, tried to eat within 2,000 kcal a day and never went stupid. Kept a cheat meal once a week so I could still enjoy takeout, started to weigh myself weekly and I still allowed myself to drink diet soda, keeping vices that made each day bearable.  

I then lost 20kg/44lbs in a comfortable 23 weeks, losing about ~0.9kg/2lbs each week. My first roadblock was week 24 where I didn’t gain or lose anything, while this deterred me I knew I wasn’t trying my hardest and knew what I could do for results. I double downed, started counting calories again with the LoseIt App and tried to find out what went wrong. Over the next 2 weeks weight loss resumed till I stumbled into another problem. I found I was eating too much of my budget for breakfast/lunch and didn’t feel satisfied with what I had remaining for dinner. This is when I tried out intermediating fasting. I did a 16:8 split and it helped me budget out each meal and allowed me to dip my toes into meal prepping. This roughly lasted 6 weeks before I went on holidays. I was sad to break the schedule but after the vacation I felt I had learnt the lessons I needed and stopped fasting. 

After coming back from vacation this time and going overboard with food I expected to see a weight increase but surprisingly didn’t. This gave me some ideas and got me into researching “re-feeds”. The outcome was a refeed once a month where I had no calorie limited, I didn’t count the calories of the day and a day where I could go stupid and try and satiate any of the cravings I had been having the past month. These refeeds aligned with board game nights with mates and made it so I could enjoy good company and good food at the same time without regret. What made me start doing these was realizing that there was no deadline to losing the weight, there was no reason why I couldn’t just enjoy myself for a day. At worst it would set me back a week at most and in the grand scheme of things that's nothing. 

By the end of 2019 I had matched my personal best of 106.3kg and was ready to embark into uncharted territory until Christmas holidays set me back 3kg/6.6lbs….however instead of getting deterred I problem solved and saw what I could change or add....I had been squandering my gym membership, which I had been still paying for monthly since 2015...It was then, 5 days out from the new years, where I started a dumbbell full body workout routine. I increased my calories to 2,000/day and every other day I’d workout. 

I’ve done my best to work out at least 3 times a week and all I can think is I should have started earlier. Working out has been incredible. Between the post workout feeling, being able to eat more, better quality sleep, waking up being easier and just feeling better has been so surreal. Watching my arms get bigger, feeling stronger and seeing my man boobs transition from saggy tits to actual pecs has been insane. I made an incredibly smart decision by buying adjustable weight dumbbells and a bench before the pandemic hit that allowed me to explore the wonders of weight lifting. Right now I’m enjoying low weight, high rep push/pull body workouts with low rest time and doing my best to avoid leg day due to working in a job that has me on my feet for 6hrs at a time. I won’t get too into what I do for exercise besides that due to how limited my knowledge is, but will list some books and resources that helped me at the end of this post. 

Covid finally caught up to me in [mid-2020](https://i.imgur.com/ocAtkNO.png) when I went for a holiday at home during June, I was at my lowest ever of 97.6kg before this and just lost motivation and sight of my goals (mainly due to losing myself in a mmo). History was repeating itself and what unraveled my success back in 2015 was going to happen again as I ended the year at 106.6kg, this terrified me. To combat this I used the power of a new years resolution to kick myself back awake and I attempted a 30 day challenge to remain on task. This involved daily weigh-ins to keep me accountable, a new gym workout routine and being back on a 16:8 split intermediate fast. The 30 day challenge only lasted 22 days due to a holiday but it was enough to get me back on task.

Currently I’m back on being relaxed about dieting. I’m not tracking my calories but generally know how much I can eat a day. Speaking of eating, I despise food prep. I hate having to think about what I have to eat, spend time acquiring the ingredients and cooking it up. The early parts of dieting was all about finding quick things to make but even that got tedious. I solved this by paying the premium and have a weekly subscription to a meals service (mymusclechef) that gives me 12 meals/week, 2 meals/day and a day off for a cheat meal, these meals cost around $10 AUD each and average around 550 calories per meal. Breakfast was solved with a 300~ calorie breakfast bar and then later replaced with oats. I still have my vices of too many Pepsi max cans a day and 1 250~300ml can of full sugar energy drink. I then augment my day with a whey protein milkshake and some packaged snacks, usually aiming for around 160~180g total protein/day. 

Example Day:  

Breakfast: 450 calories~

- Protein Bar/Cooked Oats with milk + Energy Drink 

Lunch: 500~600 calories

- My muscle chef meal
- Can of Pepsi max (1~3 calorie diet soda)

Dinner: 500~600 calories

- My muscle chef meal
- Can of Pepsi max (1~3 calorie diet soda)

Snacks: 400~500 calories

- Whey protein shake
- Cheese and Crackers on the go/assorted packaged snack
- Can of Pepsi max (1~3 calorie diet soda)

So this is about 1850~2150 calories, maybe peaking towards 2300. With how much I exercise I could probably get away with eating more. Ideally I should be cutting out the soda and energy drinks but I keep my vices to prevent myself from going insane, I don’t drink alcohol so I have room in my health budget for things that aren't good for me. In addition I have a Vitamin D, Omega3 and multivitamin supplement. What I listed here is what I found best works for me after years of experimenting and now I have a diet that I enjoy, can consistently do every day and is malleable for change. A cheat meal day usually replaces the two muscle chef meals and the rest is the same.  

In closing, the real challenge I faced losing weight is the mental strain and burden that one goes through when losing weight. To me, food was an avenue of escapism, when life got too hard to handle, food was there with its warm embrace to make me feel good even if temporarily. It got to the point where I even started feeling at ease after I ordered takeout. While what I’ve written are the things I did to help lose weight it hasn’t expressed the mental battle within myself that has taken place and still takes place to this day. I’ve been to the darkest parts of my mind twice and managed to pull myself out of it, the second time was a damn miracle but that inner voice inside my head wouldn’t shut up about wanting to keep trying, and that’s what I did. I kept trying. I took 12 years of trying but I eventually found my way. 

Rules I've incorporated into my life.  

1. Don't view dieting as punishment. I still have vices such as an energy drink and a couple cans of Pepsi Max a day. 
2. Strive for consistency over perfection. Don't let a bad weigh-in day halt or revert progress, same goes for blowing your calorie budget or moments of weakness. A 1-day set back is nothing.  Don’t be defined by the mistakes you make. 
3. Think about it everyday. Meal prep, gym, logging. I weigh in daily now to always keep myself accountable.  
4. Make time for cheat meals (1/week) and cheat days (1/month). Allow yourself to enjoy all types of foods. 
5. Don't set deadlines for goals: Losing weight is already stressful as is and if you find yourself not on ""schedule"" to be a set weight at a set point in time it just leads to unnecessary stress or worse, punishing yourself to try and reach that goal. Making your goal weight a week or two later isn't the end of the world.
6. Diet is forever, what you are doing now is what you’ll be doing at your goal weight. So find something that works, is comfortable and malleable. 
7. Make time to workout, it's literally the greatest thing ever.

"ugh help Guys, over the last 2 years I’ve gone from 230lbs to 165lbs (yay!!) For reference, I’m 5’8.5” female, age 25. I’m at a healthy weight and I’m healthier than I’ve ever been! I maintained for a year at 175 and recently went off sugar, did a healthy eating challenge and dropped to 165. The weight loss has been so slow—almost 6 months, and it’s so hard for me to stay motivated when I’m eating under 2,000 calories, mostly fruits and veggies, no processed foods, lots of water, and working out an hour a day (weights and cardio!) I feel like I’m doing everything right, but I’m burning out and I still have the dreaded chubby belly even though I can lift heavy and run for 6 miles without breaking a sweat. Does anyone have tips? Things that worked for those last 10 lbs?"

"My face has actually changed, even if I don't see it when I look in the mirror! I don't take many pictures of myself, but I am a teacher and I take screenshots of zoom classes for attendance. This has been a really good way to keep track of [my face progress](https://imgur.com/a/X8XiIjd). 

Look at that! I actually do look different. That's crazy...

To lose weight, I have been using the app Lose It! and tracking EVERYTHING I eat, even if I go over. I try to only eat when I am hungry and I eat what I want to eat (confession: I ate Doritos yesterday, but I was still under calories!). This allows me to feel like I'm not restricting myself. I have trauma related to exercise and losing weight (specifically restricting) so I am being flexible with my foods while still being within the calorie budget."
"Learned that there’s no reason to splurge on a treat if I can’t really enjoy it. I can’t believe how thoughtless and mindless I’ve been about food in the past. Eating cold food off my sons’ plates. Stuffing handfuls of chips in before anyone could see. Feeling awkward at a work meeting or party being big and eating pizza in front of everyone and not enjoying it because I’m too stressed out.

Tonight I went to my mom’s house to see my brother before he goes into rehab tomorrow. I have two sons (2 and 6) and they kept me really busy running around and feeding them, etc. I was also more into spending time with my brother and family and didn’t even eat the pizza that my family had bought. I had eaten some homemade chicken curry and cauliflower rice before heading over but definitely had room for pizza.. but the situation just wasn’t worth it. I’d literally have to just shove a slice in my mouth because I was constantly chasing after my kids. I thought about how planning for a more indulgent meal (like the pizza) that fits into my calorie goals while I’m with my husband watching a movie sounded sooo much more worth the splurge than this situation would allow. 

It’s getting easier to make these decisions and to realize that food isn’t going anywhere. No one noticed I didn’t eat the pizza because we were busy. On the flip side, my brother had stopped by with cupcakes a few weeks ago and I had one with my kids and brother and dad and took my time and savored it because I could and because it was a sweet sentiment. I overestimated on the calories and enjoyed it so much. It feels so amazing to not be ruled by food right now!"
"Help loosing weight and using Créatine to build muscle Hi everyone,
I have a lot of motivation just looking at this channel and Cico. 

I have been honestly struggling loosing and even put up some weight and I am lost as to why. So just for context, I am a male, 24 years old, 6ft and SW 215LBS. Now I am at 222LBS. My TDEE is about 2100 for sedentary. Even tho i am active and workout about 5 days a week I decided to calculate the minimum TDEE. A month and a half ago when I started eating at a deficit at 1300 Calories so about 800 calories in deficit. But I am also taking Créatine, Glutamine and BCAA. I am definitely seeing some muscles but they don’t explain the 8LBS I gained. Any help would honestly be appreciate especially since I am going back to my old ways of just binging on food."
"[questions] I know it’s mainly calories but here me out...exercise Hey redditttt 

I’m finally counting calories on MyFitnessPal!!! Not as hard as I thought it would be lol. Anyways I’ve lost 11lbs so far a month and a half? And I only eat three meals a day (few healthy snacks) and try to make it colorful and less processed. 

Anywhooo

Can me doing Chloe tings, running 2 miles, or even just lifting weights help me speed the process? I’m trying to live with “slow and steady wins the race but it’s hard. I don’t want to fast either I’ve tried.

And I should’ve kept my journey to my self because I told one person and now she brings it up everywhere and everyoneee fml 🤦🏾‍♀️ and what does everyone thing about the apple cider vinegar weight loss??"
"Binge ate again Not looking for advice really, since we all know what to do, just want to rant.

My diet's not terrible, but not great. I've been on the world's longest plateau. Typically eat well during the day, but then binge at night.

So yesterday, had healthy hearty brunch (veggie omelet and toast), healthy early dinner (fish, cauliflower rice). And still had extra calories for snacks. Worked late, so grabbed a cinnamon roll (400 cal) on my commute home. Not great, but still on my calorie count. 

But then got so stressed about everything in the world (political situation in Hong Kong is \*bad\*) that I watched terrible TV shows and ate an additional 600 calories of snacks! 

Like my snacks added up to more than all my meals of the day. I had a ham sandwich, cheese crackers and two protein bars. God knows what I was thinking.

I logged it all anyways - good to be honest with myself. And today is another day...."
"Sad all the time since weight loss? Where's my happy juice?? F(27) 5'2"" SW- 220something CW-173 First GW- 150

I've lost a decent bit of weight- 5Osomethinglbs and still going, not bad. I look a bit different, definitely easier on the eyes. I thought that's what I wanted. But I feel oddly out of place now? Just uncomfortable with the attention and hyper focus on my body from friends and family. Additionally, I see the weight loss but still feel like a ""big girl?""

And sad, like, all the time sad. What the heck is up with that?

1.)Is this just part of the journey that no one talks about or is my hardwiring frayed??

 2.)Is there a weightloss group/ sub for people that feel weird in their new body??? Like something that acknowledges losing weight is still definitely better for you despite the weirdness??"
"Anyone else have issues with losing lower belly fat (fupa) even after significant weight loss? I’m a 22 F, 5’4 SW: 174.5 CW: 149 lbs, looking to lose about 15 more pounds. I’ve been doing measurements once a week for the past 4 months to help track my progress and it seems like my fupa is taking the longest to decrease. Granted, it’s not hanging down over my kitty region but it does poke out a bit. I thought being at the weight i am, it would have nearly been non existent. 

Are there any tips for helping to get rid of this other than ab workouts and clean eating? I already do both of those and after 4 months, i’m a bit frustrated 😅 the sad part is that i see definition everywhere else in my abdomen area but there!"
"Within calorie deficit but feeling bloated today This might seem like a silly thing to worry about but maybe some words of wisdom could clear up my doubts (please?). 

I’ve been logging everything I eat on MFP religiously since I started last week. Today I decided to have a little bit of treats but keep it within my set calories for the day before I start fasting until tomorrow morning. I only went over by 31 calories (I’m still at a 600-700 cal. deficit) and though I know I’m technically fine, I feel bloated as hell like I ate 3000 calories of absolute junk and this makes me worried that I messed up. 

I know my body is getting used to eating lighter and better foods now so I’m guessing the treats probably being high in fat make me feel this way.  Am I still okay though or have I sabotaged myself for the day? Am I still losing? I just want to make sure I didn’t shoot myself in the foot and if I did, I’d rather know so I don’t make the same mistake again in the future."
"I made a huge mistake SW: 75kg CW: 75kg GW: 60kg Height: 163cm

For about a month now I’ve been changing my eating habits as well as exercising almost every day (aerobics for about 50 minutes or a 5km walk with friends). I’ve been feeling great and much healthier and happier, but the scale hasn’t budged. And despite losing a few cm off my waist measurement at the start, it hasn’t budged since then either.

I was really confused and disheartened. What was going on? Why weren’t the kilos shifting? I was logging everything onto MFP and staying under my calorie allowance.

Today it hit me. I’m eating back all my exercise calories. I’m probably overestimating calorie expenditure and underestimating calories eaten. I feel like such an idiot. 

Here’s to next month hopefully being a bit better."
"I've lost weight but it doesn't show Quick context : 26 F, 164 cms, SW: 85 Kgs CW: 74 kgs. 

I lost almost 10 kilos of weight after a lot of hard work spanning over 12 months.  Today, I met a few relatives after a year.. One of them spotted me sprawled on my couch and casually remarked : ""wow, you've still not lost weight? I heard you've been working out pretty hard.."" Not one person mentioned that I've lost weight.


And I was just so disappointed and heartbroken. I smiled and agreed with my relative, not able to say anything else. I guess I was secretly looking forward to a few compliments and was bummed when no one acknowledged my efforts.. I know that I'm still overweight, my BMI is no where close to healthy, I still have fat thighs, giant belly and I'm definitely a work in progress. I also know that I'm doing this for myself and not to hear other people's validation. But the fact that no one could spot a 10KG weightloss on me felt very demotivating. 

Has this happened to you guys? How have you dealt with this?"
"Losing weight with Endometriosis Hey yall! Anybody here deal with endo belly? It’s gotten to the point where my body composition has changed considerably (I’ve leaned out quite a bit), however my weight has stayed the same (140 pounds at 5”4). I am constantly stuck with a lower belly bloat/jiggle that never seems to leave me - even if I fast. My gynaecologist and many others suspect it is endometriosis however I am still waiting on some tests to solidify it. Because of this I’ve also been put on a very high dose of birth control, making my stomach even more swollen. Does anyone have any tips on how to reduce the bloat? Any tricks for endo belly/hormonal belly fat? I know if I shed some of the last remaining belly fat the bloat would look a little better. I am already down to about 1000-1200 calories a day and intermittent fast on a gluten free/dairy free diet to lessen the triggers of the bloat. I work out 6 days a week for about an hour with cardio and weight training."
"I lost 100 pounds! but then covid hit and I gained 40 of that back... but then I got back on track and now I’m down 100 again! relevant picture: https://imgur.com/a/22f5mvU

I was 290 pounds two years ago (the left side of the picture). I got down to 190 by just cooking at home more and eating less, but I never really went to the gym or exercise regularly. Covid hit, and suddenly I started getting a panda express bigger plate doordashed to my apartment every other night... the pounds added back up quick. I was about 230 pounds in November, I decided that that was probably a good time to cut back on the fast food again, and i also started going to my apartment’s gym every day. I’m currently back down to 190 (right side of the picture), and feeling better than ever :) 

(also if you look at the picture, I have been told before that I “don’t look 290” on the left, but I’m just tall so the weight is spread out a bit.)"
"Low calorie, easy lunch ideas? Low calorie, easy lunch ideas?

I have no clue what to eat for lunch. I’ve noticed that I’m never starving by lunch, but I’m still hungry enough where I want something. So any small/low calorie lunch or snack ideas out there? Preferably easy to make so that I can bring them to school when we go back in person again. I used to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a lot, and I realize those aren’t the best to have all the time. Any suggestions are good though! I’m just curious as to what you guys do.

"Losing and gaining the exact same 5 pounds I'm currently a 3rd year health care student and I started the weight loss journey last May as the lockdown definitely made it easier to binge eat as having the time off from university and clinical placement was welcomed but I didn't realise just how bad things were getting.

Started at 101kgs in May and I managed to bring it down to 92kgs in September from logging my food into loseit and exercise atleast 5x a week. This was mostly doing Madfit's dance workouts and trying to get steps in. Due to external factors such as a horrible clinical placement, being away from my partner, second lockdown initiated I found myself finding comfort in food.

I'm currently at 96kgs and maybe I'm just lethargic from trying to balance university/work/keeping myself sane that I'm very blasé about logging calories. I've done it before and I know it can be done again. Any tips on how to pick it up again? I'm sad seeing this little [guy](http://imgur.com/a/9haC6hx) come up atleast 4x now."
"Down 36 pounds by “developing sustainable habits, not dieting!” M24, 5’9, SW 311, CW 275

My journey started about five months ago when I finally landed my first “real” job. I finished up my masters last year and was lucky enough to get a fulltime analyst position despite everything going on with covid. Landing said new job finally allowed me to take control of my shopping, my diet, and ultimately my health.

From a very young age, probably around 10 or so, I’ve been overweight. I’ve previously tried dieting and had some success back in 10th grade. I went from 275 down to 225 in one summer. However I didn’t learn anything about cooking or forming better eating habits and I quickly gained it all back when I stopped following the strict dieting book I was given. Because of this experience, I knew I had to approach things differently this time. Dieting wasn’t the answer, I needed to change my relationship with food, understand what was and wasn’t good for me, and form realistic and sustainable habits that would also enable me to lose weight. Put more simply, my mantra this go around is “developing sustainable habits, not dieting!”

Back to the journey! With my newfound financial freedom and control of my food, I started by replacing unhealthy food choices with healthier options, i.e., instead of having two sandwiches with some chips at lunch I would have two sandwiches with a side salad, and then I moved on to having just one sandwich with some fruit and a side salad, etc. I kept making small changes like this for most of November but I wasn’t keeping track of calories or anything like that, just trying to alter the way I ate and the foods that I ate. At the beginning of December, I started noticing that my clothes were feeling a bit looser—things I had no longer been able to wear suddenly fit again. This inspired me to finally weigh myself and make things ‘official’. On December 11th, I got on the scale and damn near died from what I saw. I was expecting to be in the 270-280 range given that it was my previous highest weight and surely I didn’t think I could be above that. But, as you probably noticed by the SW at the top, I was a whopping 311! This was a major turning point for me. I become very depressed for a few nights then that depression quickly turned to anger—anger at myself for letting things get so bad—and then ultimately the anger turned into motivation.

With my depression/anger induced motivation in hand, I decided it was time to take things up a notch. I started looking into resources on how to change my diet, lose weight, etc. which is how I ended up finding this subreddit. Ultimately, I knew CICO was the way to go for me. I invested in a food scale, downloaded MyFitnessPal, and went to work. Since December 25th, just two weeks after I wanted to give up, I have weighed myself every single day to capture my weight trends and logged every single meal I have had. I’ve had weeks where I didn’t lose any weight, I’ve had days and meals where I broke and ate food I know I shouldn’t have, but I have stuck with it despite any obstacles and now I’m down 36 pounds in less than three months! Seeing my weight in the 270’s again, and soon to be 260’s, is really helping me learn to love myself again. My confidence is skyrocketing and my motivation is at an all time high!

I can’t wait to see what all this journey holds for me and where I’ll be months from now, even years, but I’m happy be finally become a part of this community and get my story out there!"
"31M - Belly/body comp questions - will this belly ever go away without surgery? Pics inside. Hi loseit.  I've been hanging out with the OMAD (one meal a day) guys and been on keto diet for 4.5 months and absolutely crushing it.  I'm 31M 5'8 and was 200 pounds in October. I currently weigh 166 and have a goal weight of 160.  I've had an interesting battle with my weight since I was a kid, and won't go into too many details, but I have been as heavy as 225 at my worst in highschool and college, 145 pounds at my skinniest when I was around 25, and got back to 200 during quarantine.

I've been in great shape doing crossfit at 170 pounds, skinny fat shape (hello, this is me), and also just fat fat.

I have never been able to get rid of my midsection - it causes me to hyper focus on it and the more weight I lose honestly the more body image issues I get and I have struggled in the past with disordered eating to try and maintain weight as I went crazy when the scale started going up.

This is me getting started again in October 2020

[https://i.imgur.com/XPeTBHC.png](https://i.imgur.com/XPeTBHC.png)

This is me today.

[https://i.imgur.com/C6h4o2r.png](https://i.imgur.com/C6h4o2r.png)

  
I feel great, my face gains are crazy, and my clothes actually fit again.  I feel and look younger.  I personally get frustrated looking at these pictures though as all I want to criticize is my lower stomach, and every time I'm shirtless in front of a mirror I am staring constantly at my midsection. My girlfriend thinks I get vain when I lose weight, but in reality I'm just staring at my belly.  I dislike how much my ribs show and in general just what my silhouette looks like, especially when part of me looks under weight and the other part I still see my 200 pound body.  

I have put in years of effort and have definitely gained, lost, and regained my entire body weight over the last 10 years as my weight has fluctuated.  It is so frustrating to never have been happy with my body as a teen or adult, and also feeling like I've done permanent damage to myself when I got fat as a kid.  

I guess my question is if this is REALLY this important to me do I need to finally just have a consultation with a plastic surgeon, or is there something I can do that will finally correct this?  Would this be skin removal, or is it stubborn belly fat?  I have seen before/afters of people who were 300+ pounds and their skin/stomach doesn't look like mine - maybe my skin just isn't as elastic as others.

I have been what I would consider underweight at 145 pounds chasing a flat stomach that I want and I just can't seem to get there no matter what I do.  I am approaching my 160 pound goal weight, and I couldn't be happier with my results and my health, but I seriously am so hyper focused on my belly and love handles and once in my life I'd like to have something closer to my ""ideal"" body.

Thanks for any input or shared experiences!"
"Lost my discipline in February I was doing great in January- I had reached my 15 pound loss mark from my 2020 excess. (After months of working on weight loss). Then February came and I was stressed from taking and waiting for the results of my professional certification exam. The valentines candy availability skyrocketed my stress eating coping mechanism. I stopped walking 10,000 steps a day minimum and making my TDEE 2500 kCal. I stopped logging in my IF app. I’m seeing the results this month with more fat on my face and a higher number on the scale. I’m making this post as a reminder to myself that it’s okay to fall off the discipline wagon *only* if I keep making efforts to get back on."
"Landed in the ER yesterday. It was awesome. I mean, having pneumonia and an abnormal EKG isn't awesome, but getting blood work done and finding out I'm no longer pre-diabetic, and no longer anemic was great.  Also, when I picked up the hospital gown the nurse left for me to put on, it didn't look like a tent.  The last time I put one on, it definitely resembled a tent.  For my own sanity I'm not weighing myself for a year.  I'm allowing myself the space to eat well, exercise a bit, really work on my mental health, and just let my body do what it's going to do.  But this means that I have had to rely entirely on non-scale victories since I started last July.  I certainly wasn't expecting any NSV's yesterday, so they were that much more motivating!"

"Lost 20 pounds but I look the same and I'm still the same pant size? I (F19 5' 1"") had slowly lost about 20 lbs since 2019 and dropped from 150 to 128. After taking a nutrition class in college, I made the decision to get healthier. I lost 10 lbs in 2019 and 10 more in 2020. 
When I told my dad that I lost 20 lbs, he said that I looked the same. I wasn't sure if it was because my weight loss was gradual or that he just doesn't pay attention. Nobody, other than my mom (and this didn't happen until recently), has commented on my appearance and I think it might be because I've been wearing a mask so they haven't been able able look at my face.
I also recently tried wearing my old jeans again (I hate wearing jeans. I mostly wear sweatpants.) and I'm the same size. I wear a size 10-11 and I'm a pear shape so I have wide hips. I'm wondering if this is because of the bone structure of my hips, or maybe I didn't lose fat on my hips?"
"How to react to the ""You've lost so much weight!"" wen you're uncomfortable talking about it? \*\*ETA\*\* Wow, typo in the title. I can't edit that. I do, in fact, know how to spell ""when.""

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost about 70lbs while working from home this year and now that my office is getting ready to go back, I'm hyper-aware of the fact that I'm going to have to deal with the ""You've lost weight"" conversation at scale when I see my colleagues for the first time. (I work with incredible people, but they comment on everything - A new hair do, a new outfit, a new picture sitting on your desk. The chances of them not bringing up a visibly different weight is very slim to none.)

What's an easy way to acknowledge the comment while opening the door to quickly move on from it? I'm really uncomfortable talking about my weight and I'm dreading the thought.

Additionally, how do you answer ""What did you do to lose weight?"" I feel like that always comes with so many follow up questions and I really want to avoid that.

Any advice or personal experience would be appreciated!"
"Why the hell am I not losing fat? For a detailed description please read my first post, that I wrote a few weeks ago. So basically the problem is still the same, I count my calories, I exercise 3-5 times a week and neither the scale nor my measurements have budged for the past almost 3 months. I’ve tried eating 200 more calories and I’ve gained back the 6kg I had lost, then I reduced them by 100, then 200, 300 and eventually 400. So now I eat about 1300 calories a day and still I am not losing weight (or rather fat). I cut out carbs to about 20-50g net carbs a day a few weeks ago but I haven’t even lost water weight.

I just don’t know why, I’ve searched Google for every possible explanation but I can’t find anything.

I’m planning to go see a doctor about why I am not losing weight at all even though I try so hard.

Does anyone know what kind of condition prevents fat loss so effectively or has anyone experienced what I am experiencing?"
"Advice for Re-losing Weight Hi! I really need advice on losing weight that I had initially lost but unfortunately regained. I (21F) am 4'11 and I currently weigh 128lbs. My heaviest was 165lbs in 2017 and in March of 2020, I was 113lbs. I was super proud because my goal weight is 110lbs. 

I managed to maintain the 113lbs until October 2020. This is when another lockdown happened in my city so gyms closed and I lost my job. Also, the weather started getting cold and I didn't want to go outside because I HATE cold weather. I basically started sitting at home all day, everyday. Around this time I started steadily gaining weight until Feb 2021 when I reached 129lbs. I'm so devastated. I went out and bought some dumbbells, kettlebells, jump rope, ab roller, etc. so I could start working out at home. 

In Feb, I started working out for 30-60 minutes a day/4-5 days a week. So far, I see a big difference in my glutei (which I'm very happy about lol) but I have not lost a single pound. I don't understand how that is even possible. Maybe I am eating more than I think but I just don't understand what happened to my body. I feel like even if I eat one cookie, I gain weight. It's so discouraging for me when I feel like I had a great week in terms of working out and eating well, but then I weigh myself and nothing has changed. I used to have a bad relationship with the scale 2 years ago as I would literally weigh myself 3 times a day. I don't want to go back to obsessing over numbers and starving myself eating 800 calories a day, but I keep thinking about how badly I just want the weight to be gone. I lost the weight before but I feel like this time is 100x harder and I cannot figure out why. It's really starting to affect my life as I hate leaving the house because I don't want people to see me.

I welcome any advice on healthy ways to cope with these feelings. I've never experienced re-gaining weight and I feel alone. If anyone has any advice or insight, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to feel this way about myself but I feel trapped and completely unmotivated. Please, if anyone can help..."
"Feeling Depressed SW 196.5 CW (weekly average) 175.8 UGW 125 So I started my weight loss journey October 23rd at 196.5 pounds. I hated the way I looked and felt. Started with an almost week long fast. Then healthy eating for a couple of months. 

January I started Keto. While I feel better on Keto. Had one cheat day in almost 2 months on Keto I felt horrible afterwards. Not mentally because I cheated, but physically. 

I’m glad that I’m down almost 21 pounds and feeling a little bit better over all. But so depressed at how much more weight I have to lose and at how long it may take. 

I lost an over all average of just a little over 1 pound per week. Which is a healthy weight loss. I have just a little over 50 more pounds to go to reach my ultimate goal weight. 

The last several weeks I tend to lose close to an average of half a pound per week. I’m cutting back my calories. Watching what I eat and trying my best to be more active. But still I’m dropping the pounds ever so slow. 

I think about if I could lose just 2 pounds per week. Which is a lot, but that would mean almost 6 months and then I’d be at my ultimate goal weight finally. While 6 months feels like a long time, it’s not too bad. 

But if I continue to lose close to half a pound per week. I won’t get there until almost 2 years from now. To be stuck at a weight I feel uncomfortable with for 2 more years. Feels like forever. 

I just almost feel like sleeping until I get to my UGW or at least a little closer. 6 more months weighing this much I could handle, even 8, but much longer I hate the thought of."
I’ve gained 30 pounds since January and I’m so upset with myself. Will I ever have the self control to keep a caloric deficit? I know since I’m on an antipsychotic medication my doctor said it could be increasing my appetite but I think I’m just developing bad habits again. I’ve never been the smartest eater and I’m trying to start counting calories but it’s been difficult getting into the habit so I’ve set reminders for myself to do that. I would try doing a fast but I know id probably fail so I’m going to try keto again. I’m currently 155lbs 5’7” and hoping to get down to at least 130. Any advice for meal planning and things that would also help? I’m starting by throwing away all my junk foods and stopping ordering fast foods. I’m gonna go grocery shopping now for some low calorie meals and hopefully get some steps in the process. If there’s any foods that you recommend for someone starting keto it would be appreciated as I’m very new to it all and have rarely dieted successfully in the past. I’m hoping I can gain some discipline and look and feel healthy again. This post I feel will also hold me a bit more accountable. Wish me luck.
"Gained body fat and lost muscle mass despite eating less calories, eating more protein, and lifting heavy. I would greatly appreciate any advice. 

I am 25, female, and started going back to the gym about two months ago. 5’5, started at 180 pounds three months ago. Now at 172.9. 

I have been eating with a 500 deficit. I burn about 2400-2500 a day and I try to eat around 2000 a day. I also have been lifting heavy and getting in cardio 6 days a week. I also get at least 100grams of protein from my food every day. 

Somehow my muscle mass decreased and my body fat increased, according to the body scanners at the gym. I am just very frustrated and feeling very defeated. 

I also don’t drink at all, I am a vegetarian but mostly eat vegan because of my lactose intolerance. 

I feel crushed thinking I have been doing so good because my clothes are getting loser and I look like I am losing weight. Which I have been, but apparently it’s been unhealthy!

What am I doing wrong!!! Truly any advice would be great. Thank you!"
"Can I still make it and live a decently long life? I'm 296 pounds, 5'11, 27 year old male. Chronic stress. Little exercise. I've been eating like total shit (and a lot of it) since I was in high school pretty much (15-16). High sugar, high sodium. Every single day pretty much, outside of a few days and a couple of weeks here and there where I get inspired. I get minor chest pains and have really high blood pressure (doctor put me on lisinopril a year ago and I've been taking it everyday since). Never had a heart attack as far as I can tell (though two weeks ago I had some minor left hand pain that radiated up my arm the next day, but it went away after a couple of days, and there was another situation a few months ago where I played basketball for the first time in years and stretched really hard and this led to some really bad chest pain that night, but it went away the next day. Could it have been a muscle?), and amazingly I don't think I have diabetes. My doctor has done blood work but never brought it up, so at least I don't think I do. Can I come back from this if I start eating right today? I was wishy-washy suicidal before which is why let myself go for so long.

I have a lot of plans now but I worry that the damage is done and I won't live very long after what I've done. Can morbidly obese people come back from a long spell like this and live fairly long lives? I honestly just want to see 50. I know nothing in life is guaranteed and I might get hit by a car tomorrow but I'm at that point where I wonder if it's worth it if I've fucked myself up too bad. Know what I mean? I'm still gonna do it for honor's sake but I want to know from someone here if I'm too far gone and how many years I possibly could have shaved off my life living this way. (And I know everyone's body is different but I want to hear from people that were in similar situations and left this bullshit years and years behind them)

Thanks."
"Need to vent about skin So I've been losing weight quite well, nearly 2 stone off since I started, but there's something that's been annoying me so much.



I currently weigh 100kg, my goal weight is 58. Giving myself 3 years to do it. Lose half my body weight.

Seems pretty reasonable, keep at 1600-1700 kcal a day. All of that is fine it's good...


But fuck!


I already have skin that isn't as tight anymore. I know I'm going to end up with loose skin Covering me and it's so demoralising!! I want to look good, I'll be honest that's my goal. If my goal was to be healthy I'd want to lose less weight and spread it over 7-9 years.


I want so badly to still be in my mid twenties and be thin and look good and be able to post thirst traps and fuck it I know that's not what I'm meant to say right I'm meant to say oh I'm only doing this for my health, or I know I look good at any weight, or loose skin doesn't bother me, but it does!!!


The losing weight, the exercise, I love it. Diet is going great. Hell even if I get surgery that doesn't scare me or anything like scars, but it's the COST. It's that in order to look good after years of childhood obesity which lead to medication caused weight gain, I now not only have to put in a fuck tonne of work to even be healthy, but to actually fucking look it I'm gonna need to shell out so much money... I don't even know how I'll pay for it! I don't know if I ever can! The reality of looking good might be nonexistent for me!!


People are into fit people, people are into fat people, I know. But I know I am so so much happier seeing myself overweight and looking good than loose skin. Not that it looks bad on other people, that's not my point, or that it's intrinsically bad to have it, it's not it's fucking impressive and shows how far someone's come. But it's not what I want to see in the mirror after all this work. And I fucking hate how unfair this all is.


Okay rant over sorry"
"TDEE for 5'4, F, 34, Moderate 20 min exercise 4 days a week. Desk job. I have calculated my TDEE to be 1600 as per the online calculator and I have been eating at 1200 for the last two months without measuring much but eyeballing it. I have logged everything I eat but I have not lost any weight at all. I quit sugar and Milk on the 1st of January and even that hasn't contributed to any weight loss. I know I am definitely eating less than before because I'd literally pile rice on my plate earlier:(  I weigh 145 lbs now. I have started doing weights the past two weeks but before that it was 15 mins workout from MADFIT on Youtube. 

I would like to understand a couple of things.

1) What would be my ideal weight?

2) I was enrolled under a coach couple of years ago and lost a bunch of weight but he asked me not to measure cabbage, Cauliflower, green beans and spinach and that was the majority of the veggies I ate back then on the diet. Do I need to go back to eating these veggies if I need to be feeling full?

3) I am a vegetarian so I eat eggs, paneer and Pulses and rice but even then I don't feel full.  Am I eating too low and not losing weight? 

4) I step on the scale every day and it's just super frustrating to neither see weightloss, nor inch loss. My birthday is end of April and I wanted to lose some weight and look good :( I know 1/2 lb per week is acceptable but I haven't even lose 1/2 lb in 2 months and March is almost over. Can I get some sample vegetarian meals for brekafast/lunch/dinner? Preferably, Indian or Asian? 

Please feel free to add any and all advice necessary because I am losing my freaking mind thinking about this and I cannot afford a coach at this point."
"Losing weight with the support of a significant other. CW/SW: 218, Height: 5’8”, Age: 23 New to posting here! Hope I cover all the important details.

I’m ready to make a life style change and improve my health (and waistline), but I am struggling with creating a clear goal / plan for myself.

My boyfriend wants to be supportive, but he has never dealt with weight or emotional eating issues. Has anyone started their journey with the help of a significant other? What kind of “rules” did you give them for helping you so that you don’t feel upset at them or controlled? Have you had to give them boundaries on what they should call you out on and what they should leave up to you? 

(To be clear, he has asked me specifically HOW he can help me because he knows it is very overwhelming for me.) 

I struggle with emotional eating, and it has been quite stressful trying to get started. I’d also welcome any tips for getting started— it feels like there are so many ways to go starting out."
"Why do I feel hungry but have no appetite yet have an appetite when I feel no hunger? Does anyone else experience this? Why doesn't my brain and body agree with each other? 

I'm trying to eat intuitively, but after having a meal I'll start craving something else later on in the day even though I'm already full and don't need to eat. Then sometimes when I'm really hungry, I just don't care about eating and have no appetite but make myself eat so that I have energy for the day. I really wish that I could feel my hunger/appetite at the same time so I can enjoy my meals more.  

I was previously on keto, but sometimes cycle back to eating carbs for 2-3 days and still feel the same disconnect between brain and body. I've always had this issue since I could remember, but it was never noticed by me because I always ate whenever I was hungry *and* had an appetite. It's only come to my attention now because I'm restricting calories.   


Don't know if it's relevant but I'm f 21, weighing 63 kg, 5'4 and moderately active. I also sleep well and eat healthy. I'd appreciate any insight/advice/commiseration."
"Hi guys I’m new to this whole diet things and am basically looking for any advice or success stories to motivate me :) Hey I’m new to Reddit so I’m not sure if I’m doing this whole thing right lol but I’m a 23yo 5’2 female and I weigh 179lbs.
I have been going through a rough two years knew I was gaining weight (I was 120 in 2019) but I didn’t think I weighed that much, it also leaves me on the obese side of the BMI.
So basically I’m trying to get back to my old weight
So I started myself on a strict 1000 cal diet which includes a majority of lean protein, leafy greens, vegetables
I’m staying away from carbs, salt, butter and alcohol, sweets also but I have never been much of a sweet tooth anyway.
One of problems areas is exercise, I used to be able to run 5 miles and thought I could just jump right back into that but I am out of breath after 30 seconds jump roping so I’m clearly not in shape and now despise doing anything with exercise
So if anyone has any advice for me im desperate!!
Also would love to hear some of your success stories to help motivate me!
I was also wondering how fast you think it would take to start seeing any weight loss 
Thankyou in advance"
"Phentermine Hello everyone! My doctor recently prescribed phentermine 37.5. I started taking it last Wednesday starting with half a tablet for the first 3 days and then up to a full tablet. I took a full tablet today at about 9am and then around 2:30 I went to take a nap on my lunch break from work and realized my heart was beating super fast. My doctor had told me before that she didn’t want my resting HR going past around 105 and even that was pushing it. I checked it and I was around 130bpm. I tried to wait it out and see if it would calm down but it didn’t. I started to get worried and was having some other symptoms (chills, dizziness) so I decided to go to the ER and get checked out. Has anyone had experienced this high of a HR while on this medicine? I want to stay on it but i’ve been in the ER for over an hour now and my resting HR isn’t really going under 106, so I don’t know if it’s going to work out."
"Hold me accountable **tl;dr: life story to delve into my psychology; question bolded at the end: 27/f/30kg to lose**

I never ever EVER posted on here. Never really been a part of the community at all. Honestly, the only posts I've ever read were on nosleep and that's just because a friend would recommend it.

My story, as it goes. I'm 27. And a half. My parents were married at this age and pregnant with me. I just think about it from time to time. How I still am not doing what I want to be doing because I keep postponing it with one excuse after the other.

I graduated from university a while ago. Said goodbye to my friends, who live all around the world. Could hardly meet up with them before this whole shebang, imagine now.

My area of expertise has nothing to do with what I've wanted to do since the age of 7. Plus, it's like...impossible to get a job without another specialization.

I left my job in November. No, please, rejoice for me. It was an unbearable situation where I was given the responsibilities of an owner without the perks. So, underpaid, underappreciated, and overworked. They still like me. Met them in the street the other day.

I left because I made the decision to go back to get an MSc, despite my first degree being in languages. So, got a lot to study for. I also got another job three days after I left the other one.

I haven't had a break since 2016.

I've always been a little chubby. Not recognizably so, I was just more rotund in areas where my peers were childlike. Got down to model-like weight when I was 16. Then it was time to apply for colleges, closed myself in my room for days on end, gained weight, went to live off on my own without any roommates, said goodbye forever to healthy eating and exercising habits, watched a LOT of tv shows, got roommates, went to live even further away from home, on my own but surrounded by friends, got slimmer. Came back to my hometown, away from my friends, got depressed, lost family members, got even more depressed, started overworking. Overeating.

""I'll stop once I'm down working there!"", I used to say. Well that didn't happen now, did it, cause the stress is now work+university. I chose this.

My main problem is, when I focus too much on my ""list of things I must do to secure a life for myself and my parents"", I get away from my social life and that sets my mentality into this loop of ""I'm not good enough"" and what does that even mean? Good enough for myself since I set the standard.

We're all overweight in my family. The only one who's been saved is my puppy.

My problem is I've made myself addicted to sugar. I adore chocolate above all else, and I cannot stop myself from having it if I know it's in the house in one form or another, be it a bar or cookies or hot cocoa.

So now my excuse for reaching age 27 without having taken proper steps toward my actual goal is because I'm 30kg overweight.

Because I'm 30kgs overweight I don't have a relationship.

Because I'm 30kgs overweight I don't post pictures of myself on social media.

Because I'm 30kgs overweight I don't feel like I deserve the happiness I'm aiming at.

Reaching my goal I fear won't be the solution to it all, but it sure will provide levity to my situation. So why am I unable to say no when a big plate of carbonara is put in front of me?

Why did I feel like having 8 nuts and hot cocoa after JUST having had lunch?

Why was I unable to stop myself?

It will take months, but I know that I don't want to look at my birthday pictures with repugnance next year. So I decided that these little updates will be my way to hold myself accountable.

Thanks for reading til now: my question is, **how do I stop myself from indulging in eating after meals? How do I channel the stress I have programmed my brain into thinking will be resolved by food into something else?**"
"Stuck Hi everyone, im a 17 year old female and im around 5’7”. Im currently recovering from a broken fibula but have permission to weight-bear. I’ve been using my family’s stationary bike and been biking for about 10-13 miles each day, trying not to go too hard on my fresh leg as im still quite stiff on it from the metal plates. I’ve been stuck at about 140 pounds for a while now, i’d love to be around 120. Im eating around 1400-1600 calories a day and haven’t seen anymore progress in about a month. I easily dropped 40 pounds on this amount of calories but now i’ve been plateaued. Should I decrease my calories? I tried to eat around 1200-1300 once but I constantly felt hungry and it just didn’t work for me. Any advice on how to end the plateau?"
"Losing 1-2 pounds per day. Am I being safe? Hello all. 

I have recently decided to take my health seriously for the first time in a long time. I started at 310 lbs and have now lost almost 20 lbs, I’m 6 foot 3, male and 24 years old. There are a couple healthy changes I have made to my diet including limiting meat and animal products which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while for environmental reasons. Watching what I eat and counting calories has shown me just how bad I was eating before so I focus now on making meals that are high in fibre and greens. I get my protein from meat substitutes and high protein legumes. 

When I started this journey I began by accepting that I had an unhealthy relationship with food. I was a “food addict” if you will. I have been able to limit my intake of unhealthy food and treat it as a recovering addiction for me and thus far I’ve been successful. I’ve not developed a hard limit on calories, most days I try to stick to roughly 1500 a day, sometimes I eat more than that up to 1,800 and I try not to have less than 1,500. I feel satisfied with the food and haven’t noticed any major changes in how I feel. 

My concern is according to the scale I’m dropping about 1-2 lbs a day doing this. My scale measures body fat and tells me I’m dropping mostly fat, less than a pound of muscle which could be a measurement error and  my body fat percentage has decreased by 3.7%. I feel like I’m eating better in terms of nutrients but dropping 1-2 lbs a day has got me concerned. 

Am I being safe? Should I do something else?

Thanks. 

TL;DR. Eat more veggies. Eat less fatty food and meat. Lose 1 lbs a day. Is this bad?"
"Lost 30lbs in 15 weeks!... But I have a question about Muscle loss So I started dieting and exercising on 12/1, which is consisting of eating 1500 healthy calories per day, 150 grams of protein, and burning about 2500 according to my smart watch. I run 3 miles 4 days per week and play sports twice per week (run football routes, play basketball). It seems like the numbers added up perfectly as I went down from 218.5 to 188.7 (5'10"" male) as of this morning in a 15 week span. Not gonna lie, I'm pretty damn proud of myself, but I still want to get down between 180-185 then start to bulk.

Now my concern here is, I lost a good amount of muscle mass. Based on the mirror test I can definitely tell I lossed a lot of fat as well because I'm less jiggly, have a tighter stomach than before, smaller love handles (still there unfortunately), and my body fat % went down. I wouldn't say that I'm a smaller version of my 218 self because I can see a lot of fat loss too, but I can definitely tell there was some muscle loss that happened.

To try and prevent this I'm eating 150-170 grams of protein and doing resistance training 3 days per week, but it seemed to not impact retaining my muscle very much.

I have a 3 questions,

-At this point I'm just going to continue doing what I'm doing to get down the last 3-8lbs since it's a little too late to change anything, but what else could I have done to retain muscle? Is it just inevitable that people will lose muscle on a heavy  calorie deficit? I read all over online that lifting and eating a heavy protein diet will slow down muscle loss but like I said before, it didn't really prevent it.

-Also, when I'm done losing my pounds and getting to my goal weight, what should I do to start gaining muscle back without also gaining fat back? Should I just increase my calorie intake to a 500 surplus daily of the healthy foods I'm eating and increase the protein intake to about 200g per day?

-Does losing a pound of muscle and a pound of fat mean that I actually lossed more fat than muscle? I ask this since muscle weighs more than fat on a mass scale. 

I'd appreciate any advice I can get. Once again, I'm super proud of what I was able to do the last 3 or so months, but the muscle loss kind of disappointed me"
"Creating a better habits that stick for weight management? I'm F 35 / 165ish pounds / 5'7"".  (*Lowest in adult life is 135, heaviest was in the 170ish range*). I chart my weight every other day, I'm not married to the number, merely using it for a point of reference. Edit: Ideally I would like to be maintained at 140-145lbs. 

\---

In the past I've followed keto (worked well for my weight management). The burger wagon strolled by, a move back to the parents and ""eh mom made something"" and the habits breezed slowly out the window.

Bought a house with my boyfriend, started doing weights. We had a huge argument resulting in a separation for 6 months. Exercising and weights were abandoned (I was near or beyond the threshold of creating a habit), I didn't bother cooking for myself but didn't eat junk. Salads and a protein source for dinners, the same breakfast and lunches, kept an eye on calories and was in a deficit. Believe I was in the 145ish range. Felt good, clothes fit nicely.

Resolved things with my boyfriend and the habits flew the coop. Yup the 6 months of them, gone like a fart in the wind. Ice cream was the biggest add in, plus Friday pizza nights, followed by sweets and robust holiday meals. This summer marks the 2nd summer of eating ""normal"" foods and being content with what goes in and doesn't come off.

\---

So why the kick for better weight management now after falling back into old habits?

Snowboarding.Hot damn it kicked my ass, serving me a solid serving of ""you are def out of shape"".

Part of being in better shape is weight management.

\---

So the question:

How do I create new habits that ""stick"" for weight management? (*Especially with the passage of 6 months of a habit just being left aside. Man that perplexes me. As though the habit was very loosely based.)*

I would like to follow a keto / calorie deficit style program."
"Haven’t been able to go the gym in a week 22F

I’m going through a move right now (moving back to my dad’s house to help take care of him as he’s kinda old and lonely) and I’m also working 56 hours this week as I work at a pharmacy and we finally got the vaccine (yay!). I’ve been dieting under 1500 and going to the gym MWF every week since January and I’ve been feeling great and have lost 15 pounds so far! 

But now, I feel like absolute GARBAGE between the stress of work, helping my dad, and not being able to go the gym.

I haven’t been able to weigh myself in two weeks either. My diet hasn’t been the healthiest since I’ve been so busy (fast food, quick frozen meals, doordash) but I’m still staying under 1500 for the most part. 

Is this going to affect my progress at all do you guys think? I haven’t lost the motivation which I think is the biggest thing but i have this irrational fear that not going to the gym for a week will make me gain 30 pounds instantly lol."
"Struggling to restart! Body feels so stiff! Help! Just to get it out of the way. I am using the app  and I will likely have  missed a few words or spelling/ autocorrect mistakes. However, I hope my post makes sense. 

Stats: 32F / currently 200lbs (90.7 kg)/ height 4ft 9in ( or  145 cm) / very sedentary  job

About 7 - 8 years ago,  I started  my weight loss journey  following loseit and 90daysgoal subreddits  as guides to help me manage. I did really well over that year or two and was only about 10 lbs (was at 133 lbs or 60.3 kg)  from my absolute  goal, and felt amazing minus the fact my heart rate while hiking could be very high.  I met my current  boyfriend and switched companies to further my career; which included a lot of travel. For a period  of time.

Fast forward  a bit to we moved and since then I noticed my drive, my eating habits, and my movement  deteriorated  to point i am officially at my highest weight, and I mentally feel drained. I am  trying  to see someone for my mental health as I think I finally burned  out. (I have  a lot I deal with in my home band work life, and both sides basically tell me to fix the other side,  so I can focus properly.) Personally  I just want like 6 months off on a beach doing nothing,  but that is not realistic, so I'm trying to self help myself, on top of trying  not to worry about my partner  as he struggles  with online learning  as someone  who deals with anxiety, and depression who's counseling support team disappeared nearby the beginning  of COVID, so I'm his sounding board again. 

On top of that I work an office  job that has high workloads and expectations  this time of year, and I feel very underpaid for. These affect my mental health, which in turn affects my drive and increases my junk food cravings  and refusal to really try to make food (so I lean on my classics, bread, minute rice, and frozen items like chicken nuggets, or stuffed  chicken breasts. I don't want to make my simple salads. Or track anything,  even though I know it'll help in the long run. I'm fighting myself  here, and am trying with just simply trying to get back to tracking alone.

The worst of all of it though and the spot I really want help  in right now is my body feels so stiff. I can barely do chores without my lower back killing me. A 15 min walk is even hard on my lower back. I think I need to stretch my hips, and top of thigh (not sure the name of the top of thigh muscle as I think sitting shortens that one). I tried to look up stretches  but most are not  ones I can even get into the position  of at this time.  My belly is too big so I don't get a good range or form. 

What are some stretches you recommend  someone to try?




TL;DR - Reached the most weight I ever had. I know I have  to fight myself on many items like my food choices and intake. But I really want to get back to walking, but need help with stretches to ease lower back/hip pain. Body stiff from long hours sitting and inactivity.  Belly weight makes found stretches hard to do in a good form.

Quick edit:// as I see a potential trend to yoga happening, I want to also ask, what are some go to stretches for quick breaks during the day ( think cubicle/ not much space stretches) that you found helpful?"
"Not losing any more weight Hi I'm looking for advice.. I'm 5'2 30f 175 pounds. I have so far lost 21 pounds I was 196 pounds around 10 months ago. 

I cannot seem to lose any more  weight. For a month I've been 175/176 pounds. I can no longer sustain 1300 calories a day I start eating 1300 on Mon but by Thursday I am eating so much more because I feel so hungry. Before I lost weight I could sustain the 1300 cals but now I feel too hungry and all I can think of is food. So I end up keeping or putting on weight.

"Consistency is the worst I had been with a ""coach"" for a few months. I didn't follow her plan to the T... I mean, I started in December, the foodiest time of the year. So I ""STARTED"" in January. I didn't lose much, we played with the calories and I probably lost 2lbs in the month. Same issue in February. I had posted to another thread about this wondering if it's my calories and macros and someone had suggested eat on a weekend, don't plan it, just eat, and restart the next day. I did that. 
Yesterday morning, I weighed at 232.2... I knew my weight would go up, it went up 2lbs.. damn. 
This morning, I weighed myself and it was 227.6! The woosh is real. 

I've been working hard at the gym, I did slack on my meal plan but I'm back to it. Consistency has been hard when I haven't seen anything move. But I see it now, and I'm going to keep going. And every so often, I'm just going to eat. 
I'm not a bikini competitor, I'm eating to my lifestyle and I'm leaving room for life... friends, events. I'm feeling so proud of myself right now."
"Wondering if you can help with Keto? Hi again!

I posted earlier this week, about starting to diet again and have begun to make some progress with regards to exercising more, rather than food.

With regard to food, one of my friends introduced me to Keto; and I just wondered if any of you have used it and what results regarding health and weight loss have you encountered.

I've tried searching for guides; and using reddit confuses me slightly 😅
So if anyone could point me in the right direction for understanding this way of eating, recipes and general material - it would be greatly appreciated.

The most I can generally gleam is its low-carb, high fat and promotes Ketosis? I think that's right anyway.

Stay safe everyone! Thank you for being a supportive community in the short time that I've used it as an active member."
"M/18/5’9/90kg Diet Question 
Hi, from the title you can see I’m 18,5’9 and 90kg. Over lockdown I put a stone and a half on and it’s primarily fat. Over the last 3 weeks I’ve been eating 1,500 calories a day (to maintain it was something around 2400) , I used my fitness pal and this told me I would burn 0.8 kg a week using this.

I mainly eat protein and carbs for dinner/lunch. fruit and veg for breakfast, I also have 1 cheat day a week but I only eat up to my calories which will maintain my weight on the cheat day.

I have also been exercising 4 times a week, usually a 30 min bike ride, mostly up hill.

It’s been 3 weeks and my weight has been fluctuating between 90-91kg, I have lost no weight at all and I see no change in my weight.

Am I expecting too much too soon? Is the cheat day ruining my progress? I’m sorry for the long post I just feel like I’m doing something wrong.

Any help would be appreciated😄thanks"
"Does ""hunger madness"" go away when fasting for you guys? Hey everyone. I am a 23 year old male, 6'3"" and currently 209 pounds. I have some pretty strong insecurity about my body and so I am trying to lose enough weight to begin seeing my abs instead of my stomach fat. To this end, I am doing the following

A: Following a five day gym program that aims at progressively getting stronger each week at the four main lifts (Bench, Overhead, Deadlift, Squat) while doing some accessory work. I'd say each day takes me 40-90 mins to complete. 

B: Trying to improve my diet. I have anosmia (meaning I can't smell) and a pleasant side effect is that my tastes are really different. I have never enjoyed sugary foods or drinks and so I haven't had to cut them out of my diet since they never existed! However, I have an issue with binge eating/eating in excess for meals, like ordering a burger with an extra pattie or always getting the large option for sides. This behaviour happens with both takeout food and home food, probably spawning from people telling me i need to eat more because I'm tall when i was a teenager.  To counter this, I am trying to eat only food i cook at home that is relatively healthy and satiating. 

C: I am counting my calories and currently am trying to eat at a weekly average of 1500 calories a day. I say weekly average because I occasionally have big blowout meals followed by a day of much less food to compensate. I know this is low-ish for a person of my height, but I am sick of underestimating how much i am eating and not seeing progress from a more relaxed goal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that I might try and fast for a few days a week to accelerate the initial process. Right now, the mental anguish from being skinnyfat just barely outweighs the gnawing hunger I get after not eating for 6-10 hours, but i can't imagine having this sensation of hunger for a period of days or weeks! I have seen online that some people report that they stop feeling so hungry after X period of time and from there it is smooth sailing. I wanted to ask what your guys experience has been regarding that?"
"Frustrated! Gaining Weight after Weight Lifting

Hi everyone! I have been doing a mix of HIIT, dance, hill walking, and hiking as my exercise for the past two months but recently (like Monday) I started doing at home weight lifting workouts too. I haven’t lost any weight since then (even though I do 40 min of HIIT, 30 min of hill walking, and 30 min of Pilates/strength) and I’m not sure what’s going on. Please tell me what I can do! I have been eating around 1200-1400 everyday (I do OMAD). I also drink around 110 oz of water a day. 

I lost weight (around 15 pounds) pretty fast in the beginning but now I’m stalled at around 190. I don’t want to cut out strength because it’s necessary but it is so frustrating to not see the scale move, especially when I know just cardio will make it move."
"Sincere question as someone who’s been going through the process of losing weight and just got into medical school This thought was raised when I saw another post on here about no longer hating doctors. I’ve seen quite a few posts here that are very critical of doctors. I’ve seen a lot of people say (not just specifically here) that doctors have overlooked serious health issues because of a patient’s weight and blamed every concern that they raised on their weight. My weight gain occurred really rapidly, and I haven’t actually had a physical in probably two years. Prior to that, I was always underweight/a normal weight, so I haven’t experienced visiting a doctor as someone who is overweight/obese. Understanding that there are very real health risks associated with being overweight or obese, how do you wish your doctor had communicated this information differently? Is there a way they could have expressed this in a way that was less alienating? I don’t want to ever be a physician who hurts patients more than helps them, and I’ve been thinking about this question a lot recently."
"Don’t want it enough to get over the first day, but desperately need to. How do you help this?  - The last time I lost weight was this time last year. I went borderline disorder, eating one slice of bread at morning until dinner in the evening. Suffice to say, I don’t need that. But the idea is that I got disciplined and builded good habits, but now, I just can’t.
 - before I get disciplined, I need to want it, or to have motivation to build discipline, but I simply don’t want it more than I want food in the evening. I only ever get an ounce of motivation when I *ahem* see attractive girls my age on Instagram that I know I could never get with at this weight. That motivation only lasts a good 20 minutes however.
 - how do you get over this? Or without a want or motivation, how do you get over the first week and build discipline?"

I have not seen any change in my weight for some time now. Whether with the scale, through photos or measurements- I am at a standstill. I enter my calories into an app every day and always make sure to enter everything as accurately as possible. I have stayed in a good calorie deficit for quite some time. Of course, I updated my calorie needs after I lost some weight, so that can't be the problem anymore. I now also exercise regularly.

After going from 200 to 168 and baggier clothing, I thought I'd be at *least one* size down. Nope. Still the same size in clothing. And for some reason, it felt like I could just say 'fuck it' and go back to my old binge-eating all week / no working out ways. What was the point? I wasn't a single-digit size like I'd hope I would be. Nothing changed.

Then I took a hard look at myself and did my workout / planned the week ahead for meals / decided to make a reminder in my phone to up my protein intake and look up pre-workout mixes to help with my spring training for a faster 5K.

Because I had to remember that toxic mentality of comparing absolutely ridiculous American sizes for clothing did not equal my worth in my achievements. It doesn't negate the fact that I can do HIIT for an hour and my core strength has greatly improved. It certainly doesn't mean the past year of working on myself mentally and physically didn't matter. It also doesn't mean I won't eventually see my belly 'disappear' -- it took years to form, so it will take years to leave.

So today I'm back on my calorie deficit (it was my birthday last week so I gave up some food slack to enjoy it), I start Week 5 of the Heather Robertson workout program, &amp; I'm considering going for a quick mile run after work to celebrate the new weather.

Don't let dumb numbers ruin how much progress you've accomplished."
"I want to hold myself accountable by posting about my whole journey here! Hi! I want to hold myself accountable in my weight loss/ fitness/ health journey so I’m posting my story here (hope that’s allowed!) :)

So I am a 25 year old woman. I am 5 ft 2. I was always a kind of chubby kid, and it really set in during puberty. I went through a phase of hating my body, then came to love and accept it in my late teens. My weight has always fluctuated but usually sat around 170lbs. In the first few years of university I gained a few pounds, but when I was 21/22, I got really into the gym and healthy eating and lost the weight, back down to 170lbs. 

I know 170lbs is still overweight for my height. My waist was 36 inches and around my tummy (across my bellybutton) was about 40 inches. I had a bit of a tum but I didn’t mind it. I was confident and happy in myself at that weight, was eating healthy and felt good. 

Then the lockdown happened. Here in Ireland, we have been in full lockdown pretty much for an entire year, with a tiny break last summer. And it has destroyed me. We’re not allowed further than five kilometres from our homes, and all gyms are closed. I lost the will to exercise because I was depressed and anxious, I started eating really really poorly, my posture got so much worse from being slumped in the couch all day (which only made me look even fatter). I didn’t realise how much weight I had gained until I tried to fit into a dress at Christmas time that had fit me only the week before lockdown began in March 2020. It wouldn’t even close over. 

I’ve gone from wearing a UK 16 (or occasionally even a 14) or L to a UK 18, maybe even a 20, and XL. I had to buy all new underwear because my bras don’t fit any more. I’ve hit 200lbs and my waist now measures at 40 inches. Around my bellybutton is now 44 and a half inches. I have a double chin and a huge belly and bat wings on my arms and my thighs have gone super dimply. I just want my old self back. 

I don’t want to lose loads of weight. I don’t want to be “thin”. I just want to feel like myself again, fit into my clothes again, and feel confident and strong in my body. 

So I’m giving myself until July 1st. There’s nothing like a deadline to motivate me, and I’ll be out of work until then according to Ireland’s current lockdown trajectory. So I’m going to use my time wisely. 

I will try to drink three litres of water a day, but at least 2. 

I will go for a run or a cycle every single morning. One or the other. 

I will practice yoga every day. This will improve my posture, will help me features to help with weight loss, and will help me burn calories. 

I will walk everywhere that I can. I will go for walks at lunch time. 

I will eat as healthy as I can. I will take my probiotics and my vitamin supplements daily. 

I won’t be strictly tracking calories but I will be keeping an eye on them so as to not ever overeat by a huge amount. 

I will only weigh myself at the very end of the challenge. I don’t want to fixate on the actual weight aspect, more so on the feeling strong and confident aspect of things."
"Short Work Contract is Causing Stress Eating - What are Everyone's Best Tricks? So, I'm in the UK and we are still under a pretty hard lockdown.  I've taken a remote contract that was supposed to be 25 hours a week.  But they moved my hours cap to full-time and acted like it was great news!  The really great news is that it's a short contract and I don't have to take the contract extension!

However, for just a few months I am stuck and I am watching myself stress eat WAY too much.  I'm not hoping for a miracle here, just to maintain my weight at a less-then-perfect number, until I'm on to the next step in life.  I guess I could also be asking, how do people work from home and cope with feeling both bored and stressed?"
"the power of MINI breaks along the weight loss road Howdy awesome losers :)

I just wanted to say - and i learned it here first! - that taking little ""rests"" (meaning, eating at maintenance for your weight as it is TODAY) can be a powerful thing. 

Every 5 pounds or so, I take a week or so and just eat a bit more (healthy food at maintenance calories), feeling myself eaaaaaasing into my new weight.

I  think of it as letting myself ""get used to"" my new weight, which, when you think about it, might be a bit traumatic for your body (&amp; mind?). I see the same number on the scale everyday and it's all good, as long as it doesn't go up.

Then, renewed, fortified and feeling strong, I can dive back into deficit with energy and vigor! (instead of feeling worn down and sapped)  

Just a little tip for you, from a tomato. :)"
"Just had a nutritionist tell me I probably couldn't get to my goal (F, 31, CW: 135; GW: 120) Not that I blame her really. Sounds like she didn't want to overpromise. 

Still, it's a devastating thing to hear.

I'm looking around for a nutritionist/dietician ever since it looks like I might have subclinical hypothyroid and my weight suddenly went up 5 pounds overnight without any change in diet. I'm not on any meds until I do a second test with my endo in April. 

I'm actually exercising more and logging my food more than I ever have in this pandemic and to see my weight go up is infuriating. My stupid thyroid is fucking my body and my mental health completely over. 

I have fluctuated between 128 and 131 for 10 years. I want to go from my abnormally high 135 and go to the lowest I've ever been, 120. She said she could probably take me to 125ish. I don't know if I'll be happy that I can't get to my goal. I'm already trying to look for other places for another opinion, but it's hard to find non-predatory, sketchy places that charge high-end prices.

Any advice, success stories, happy thoughts would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks."
"I exercises 5 days a week and eat ~1400 cals a day, but I haven't lost a single pound. What could I be doing wrong? How do I stay motivated? I'm 4'11 and currently 118lbs, the most I've ever weighed. Last spring, I was at my all-time low and weight goal of 105. Now, I'm heavier than I've ever been and I noticed the difference. I feel very insecure about sharing my experience because I am often told I have no right to complain- obesity runs in my family and everyone around me is much larger. I thought I could maybe go to this forum to ask for some help, because my family isn't very supportive of these conversations...

Presently, I work out for 35-60 minutes (cardio and weights) five days a week. According to MyFitnessPal, I eat around 1400 cals a day and try to walk 10k steps every day due to chronic pain. I only drink water, iced coffee (no sugar) and I indulge on weekends by having 1 or 2 ciders with my partner. When I realized my weight was going up, I started exercising and eating better- it's been a month and while I am stronger and can do more reps (Me? Doing pushups?! I never thought I'd see the day!), I haven't lost a single pound and I look the same. I can't even fit into my jeans. I feel so discouraged and this makes me want to give up.

What can I do to combat this disappointment? And what do you think could possibly be the problem? The math just doesn't add up!"
"I want to lose my arm fat but i cant. Any tips? So, I’ve always struggled with weight, and my size has varied from 143 at the lowest to 225 at the highest. I’m currently at 194 and still going after losing 31 pounds so far. Unfortunately, even at my lowest weight my arms are always larger, BUT when I was 143-170 they are at a size that i can deal with and feel comfortable sleevless.

Now i know we cant spot reduce and i know slow and steady is the best weight loss of course, but i am feeling really good body wise, but i want to get my arms to a good place by summer. Is there ANYTHING i can do or focus on in the next few months to ensure that i make some progress in my arms by summer?"
"Why Damage Limitation at the weekend could be a game changer... If you're anything like me (and one thing I have learned here is that there are lots of people like me) then you are less disciplined at the weekend than during the week.  I've been super-careful during the week and letting things slide at the weekends.

What I have realised is that this is skewing my numbers and putting me into a gain-loss pattern.

The most obvious thing is that I gain weight at the weekends.  I over eat, I eat too much salt and I gain sometimes as much as 5 or 6lbs in a couple of days.  

The next, less obvious, thing is when I get back on track, that weight drops off *fairly* easily.  Not super easily, but with fresh food, lower salt and plenty of water it's gone by Wednesday/Thursday.

The problem is, in my mind, I am therefore trucking along on Thursday, back to good losses and can ease up a little at the weekend...then, guess what?

The past 3 weeks or so I have ""plateaued"" only it hasn't been a plateau at all, it has been the gain-loss cycle described above.

This weekend I tried damage limitation - only one indulgent meal, very little snacking, plenty of exercise and hydration.  And I came through the weekend with no gain.  Now, I am back into weekdays with my set routines, training plan, pre-prepared meals etc and I should be able to parlay the weekend into a proper loss by Friday.  

TL:DR.  Losing the plot at weekends can put you in a gain-loss pattern.  Changing that to a maintain-loss pattern can transform your results.

Hope this helps someone."
"Started My Journey at 29! 240 to 180 Hello everyone,

I am writing this post to thank the people that achieved what I've started and also to document my progress. I will update this post weekly mainly as a way to hold myself accountable.

So here's my journey and plan:
- I am currently 29 with a 6'0 height and 240 lbs. I've had excess weight as long as I knew myself and wanted to lose it before starting my 30s. I am planning to reach 200 lbs by the mid-summer and 180 lbs by fall.

- I will be limiting my calorie intake at 1500. As I am working from home, it is easier to cut calories as most of the time I am at BMR levels of activity. Also I've observed my food consumption and other than occasional fast food and snacks I am eating at a 2000-2200 level so cutting would not be drastic.

- Cardio - walk 6 days a week with at least 30-min per day with 3.5 mph speed. This is to lower my cholesterol, insulin resistance and boost endorphins.

- Weight training for 3 days per week. This is to improve my calorie deficit and also gain some muscular mass while lowering fat mass.

- No meals after 7PM, only water.

Overall, I've calculated to be at a 1000 calories deficit per day which should help me achieve my goals. One issue that is bugging me is my current meal plan macros are 25% fat, 40% carb with 1/7 of them fibers and 35% protein. Should I lower my carb gradually and increase my protein or would this be enough?


Also, would this weight change create saggy skin and how can I mitigate it?


Please feel free to provide comments/feedback on my plan,
Thanks guys!"
"Can't stop binging on weekends On the weekdays I never have a problem with my diet and honestly enjoy the diet and don't ever even really think of breaking it, but for some odd reason everytime the weekend comes I automatically pig out and just eat every piece of junk food I can. Its been like this for about a month or two and I'm still losing weight of course but its being slightly mitigated by my weekend binges and I just cannot seem to stop. I keep trying g to find the reasoning behind it because its not even like I do it to taste junk food again because sometimes I eat junk food I dont even really like the taste of its almost like I do it just to stuff my face with junk food. Im really not sure why or what happens but I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix this or had some experience with this and knows how to fix it. Thanks in advance!"
"Tdee as a teen I am a 17 year old male, 83kg, 172cm, a BMI of 28. I started at 91kg and was basically obese so I decided to do something about it.

In the past two months, I calculated my tdee using an online calculator, started eating at a 500 calorie deficit, walked for around 2 hours on most days (estimated 500 - 600 calories burned) and I am losing roughly 1kg per week just like I calculated (lost 9kg in the past 2 months).

So I've started reading a lot about how teenagers actually have a higher tdee than adults and how an adult tdee calculator can't be used to calculate my tdee but I've been using one this whole time and it has been very accurate. I tried using a minor tdee calculator and according to that my tdee is 2700cal. If I ate that much and still did my daily walks, I would probably actually gain weight. My main concern about this is actually getting enough calories as a teen so that I don't limit my growth.

So I guess I just want ask if I'm missing something or if my tdee is just unusually low for my age?"

"Help/question on losing weight Hello,

I decided on Feb 2nd that something needed to change and I wanted to lose weight. I stopped drinking soda and stopped eating fast food.

I am 5'5 and weigh 190 pounds.

&amp;#x200B;

when I started losing weight it went well i lost 10 pounds quickly just be stopping soda. from Feb 2nd to March 1st, I went from 190 to 178.4 pounds. What has been killing my motivation, since march 1st im hovering around 178-179 (let me see 177 once!!!) so I decided to add whey protein and a multivitamin, which I added on march 5th. Taking whey protein twice daily and light cardio 30-60 mins a day. but im still 178.4 pounds. should I not take whey protein? not sure what else to do

Edit: since people asked about calories 

Going to add on, I am not really counting calories I changed the way i eat (prob not the smartest) but i went from drinking 32-60 oz of soda a day and eating fast food sometimes twice a day. and currently im eating the following (not counting calories)

breakfast - oatmeal / shake

snack - apple or yogurt

lunch - plain turkey sandwich with a slice of cheese / yogurt

snack 

dinner - chicken breast / broccoli 

I have been eating this way since feb 2nd and i stop eating at 7 PM"
"Using a 20 lb cardboard box at Work during breaks to try to get stronger I tried asking this question in r/fitness and promptly got muted and the permanently banned, I dunno why.  If there is something objectionable here that I don't see I apologise.   Maybe I'm just not hardcore enough or something.  Anyways...

I'm a 56-year-old woman, and I have an elliptical at home that use I use nearly every day, so I think I'm fine on cardio. I don't own a weight set, nor am I keen to buy one.

I work in a factory, and today I got the idea to fill up a smallish rectangular box with scrap and use that to lift during my breaks. The box is long enough that I can hold it easily with both hands, and I can balance it on one hand too if I try. I get 4 ten minutes breaks.

Today I just tried holding each end and lifting it up to my shoulders. I could only do that a couple of times before I got sore. I also held each end close to my chest and then bent my waist a few times. I could feel it in my stomach muscles, so maybe I'm doing some good?

Is there anything else I can try do to try to get in better shape? I know my situation isn't ideal, but I still feel that I can do something good for my body rather than just sitting on my rear."
"Zero prep, zero cooking methods of losing weight I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post this in, if not can someone please point me in the right direction.

I’m currently going through quite severe depression in addition to a difficult to treat chronic health disorder which causes me lots of pain and discomfort and I have approximately zero energy to exert on anything beyond getting out of bed and using the toilet. Anything beyond that drains my energy faster than google maps drains my phone. I don’t have the energy to even maintain proper hygiene and can only shower every few day. Due to this, I particularly struggle with food prep and cooking. Food preparation and cooking isn’t problematic in and of itself, it’s just the energy used to gather up ingredients and wash, cut or prepare them, the energy used to stand at the stove and the energy used to wash up afterwards. Washing up in particular causes me a lot of pain. I am not exaggerating when I say that I am looking for recipes with zero prep and cooking that are vaguely healthy, not excessively high in calories and can sustain me if eaten only once a day.

I am trying to lose weight because now I’ve become diabetic and I am terrified of organ damage but I don’t have the energy or strength to cook healthy meals for myself. I’m not the typical case of severe depression as I am also obese and eating food is currently the last thing standing in my life which gets me out of bed. It is the only thing I look forward to, but I can eat other things if I didn’t have to prepare them. The reason why junk food is usually my go-to is because it only involves me ordering in and simply eating it.

I am poor and spend all my money on ordering in, as I can’t work due to the pandemic and my reasons for living seem to dwindle by the day. I live in the UK and am on the waiting list to speak to a therapist and I cannot afford private therapy. I do not have anyone that can help me, as I live on my own and don’t have friends or a partner that can assist.

I’m ideally looking for healthy snacks, healthy ready meals or recipes with virtually no need for cooking or preparation or washing up (beyond the plate used for the meal itself). I know I’m asking a lot, but I genuinely don’t see a way out. I’ve attempted suicide once already because my life seems to be spiralling and I am stuck in a perpetual cycle of being terrified of increasingly worsened health but not having the energy to eat healthy meals."
"I want to finally start my journey, I just need to take the first step. I’m 29, 5’0, and I weigh 245lbs. Many people don’t believe me when I say I weigh that much because I carry a lot of my weight on my hips and thighs. I’ve been overweight/obese all of my life. I want to be healthier and live differently than I have these past 29 years. I want to feel comfortable in my own body, and I don’t mean in regards to body image. I just don’t feel comfortable in my body and feel tired all the time, I can’t do much because my weight holds me back. I know it won’t be easy and I will experience  several setbacks, but I want to make a serious commitment and use everything I have in me to reach my goal. 


Some words of encouragement and/or advice would be very much appreciated."

"Surprised after analyzing my sugar intake Hello today I took an inventory of my current sugar intake and was a little surprised by how high it was. I'm hoping this sub can give me some input as to what I may want to change or eliminate first. I eat most of the sugar before 4pm, and the types of sugars vary. Really appreciate any advice.

A current weekday usually consists of the following before 4pm:

Morning gym shake: 1.5c milk -26g, banana 14g, 1 scoop protein powder 0g, 0.5c oats 1g, 1tbsp peanut butter 2g

Kombucha (a treat I guess, but I like the gut biome qualities) 16g

Fage greek yogurt with honey (I eat half the honey) 20ish g

A Bays english muffin with 2 eggs, smoked salmon, dill, red onion and a small smear of cream cheese - 2g in the Bays but refined carb

Usually a Larabar as a snack during the day -17g

Lunch usually something like a shredded chicken breast or tuna sandwich on whole wheat bread, tortikla, or mixed with brown rice ramen noodle serving, veggies, little mayo etc

At night my wife cooks and there's usually some type of ""healthy"" carb like lentil or chick pea pastas, almond flour turkey meatballs, 90/10 beef dishes, lean meats, healthy soups, veggies etc.

I almost never eats sweets like sugar, candy, etc on weeknights.

2-3 measured alcoholic drinks 4x a week. Cocktails on weekdays are dry (martini etc), do have craft ipas sometimes, and wine

6'3 195lbs normally, but right now ive been 205ish, but this is after I added the milk based gym shake in the mornings about 4 months ago.

Gym 5-6x a week, rigorous, capable of lifting heavy weight 250-300lb bench if maxing

Run 2.5 miles 4-5x week or swim 30min 4-5x week, one of the two

I cook and have cheat meals on weekend nights like Italian, pasta etc. 

I always considered my diet somewhat balanced and maintain a pretty good physique for 38yo male, but was taken aback that the weekday staples mentioned earlier were already in the 100+g sugar range and the national average is something like 75 for the day.

Again I appreciate any input, advice, or recommendations for what I should eliminate first. Shooting to get back down to 195 for summer. Thanks in advance."
"Can I lose 100lb in 9 months? 25 year old female, currently 280lb, 175cm (5’88). My goal weight is 155lb. I’m a nursing student full time - am mostly inactive at the moment. 
After a tirade of surgeries that left me bed bound during recovery I gained a lot of weight and stopped exercising. I’m meeting some online friends for the first time in December and want to push to lose 100lb by then - I know it seems like a ridiculous thing to say but would it be do-able?
I am currently doing no exercise and my eating habits aren’t too bad - I drink my calories too often which has been my downfall mainly (too much soft drink) but I have already stopped drinking drinks other than water. 
Prior to the large weight gain I sat between 155-180lb, and was always very active (a state athlete). 
If I make more radical changes to diet/exercise is this achievable for me?"
"What's Y'all's Satiation Tricks? Since I lost the first 80 I've been yoyo-ing the same 5 lbs over and over for the past 4 months. Whoops! 😂

I know I have to eat less at my meals, but sometimes they just feel so meager. I like to feel full and I don't seem to hit that feeling of satisfaction.

Before my weightloss journey I could top 3000 calories easy, and old habits die hard.

Anyways. I lost 80 freaking lbs! And I have 60 more to get into healthy range! But I could use some tips and tricks

I want to use them to maintain my new healthy body when I get there. My labs have come out so clean since I've started and I just want to continue seeing that healthy progress. I went from pre-diabetes and high cholesterol to healthy! I just have a little work with my eGFR values.

"Looking for some advice on calorie totals Hello everyone - just for general I am a 29 year old female my SW: 80 kg and my CW: 60 kg and my height: 170 cm. 

It’s been a long journey to get where I am currently (about two years) and a lot of mistakes such as starving myself to try and achieve my goals. I’ve recently started clean eating and weight lifting rather than focusing on extreme amounts of cardio and mass amounts of under eating and then binging over the weekend. 

I’ve always had a bit of an issue around calories. My fitness pal recommends that if I was sedentary and did nothing all day I would need about 1200 calories to sustain myself. 

I weight lift and do high intensity training at least 4-5 times a week and on average walk about 2 miles a day if not four sometimes. I’m also a secondary school teacher and have to move around my school to teach.

I currently max out about 1400 calories a day - is this enough or do I need to eat more? I also track my macros and try to make sure they are balanced as possible.

Thank you!"

Does anyone have any advice of diets or tips so I can lose 25 lbs?

It’s discouraging I gained so much weight I can’t even process how it all happened so quickly. I basically gained 25 lbs in a year. So any advice would help greatly. I’m ready for a change!!!"
"Chance I have a thyroid or similar issue? Hi, been a lurker here for a bit. Info: 25F, 5’5”, currently ~173-175 lbs depending on the day.

recently wondering if there’s a chance I have some condition that makes losing weight a real slog. Lots of details: 

• 2018: ~140lbs. 


• Across 2018, 2019: gained ~10-15. fed at my tech job for breakfast/lunch every day. did tend to make healthy choices there. 

• 2019: started Orange Theory 3-6 times a week religiously. I work a very sedentary job (software).  most athletic I’d been since high school cross country. on gym leaderboards etc. 150-155lbs. 

• Covid: Gained ~5lbs (no more OTF). eating quite healthy, 1400-1500 calories per day since I moved back home and could track EVERYTHING. I have a new scale, I weigh even my flax seeds and cooking oil etc. ~160 lbs through Halloween.

• Holidays 2020: fell off the rails but not any worse than previous years. gained 10-15. At 175lbs. Day after Christmas: wtf! revert to strictly 1400 calorie days. My 60 year old mom eats the same as me (I’m living with her atm). She’s sedentary. Like 1-2k steps a day. I start to walk 10-12k+ steps every single day, religiously (got Apple Watch at new year). some light lifting and/or 30 minute YouTube video twice a week (in addition to the walks). Religiously hit my daily watch goal of 45 min of exercise. 

Issue: weight is coming off at a glacial pace. At like 0.25-0.5 pounds a week if lucky. Lose It says I should be losing 2 a week! 

mom’s weight melted off, 15+  pounds in the same time frame with no exercise. I don’t eat back calories after exercise. 

I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been despite being way healthier than my 2018 self. so frustrated. hoped to be 170 at least, after two months.  

Like I said, I weigh EVERYTHING. Almost obsessively. 

Is there a chance I have some condition? Like I don’t burn as many calories as someone else just doing nothing? not familiar with conditions that might hinder weight loss. 

Currently have a heart rate of 50 when I sleep and rest, is that indicative of anything? At Orange Theory, I struggled to get my splat points (earned per minute of elevated heart rate over a threshold) even when running faster and lifting heavier than relatively fit people around me. 

made an appointment a month out with GP for blood panels, but this might keep me motivated until then... 

Maybe I need to lower to 1200 daily, but that seems so low given my current activity and previous eating habits a few years ago. Maybe I’m just totally wrong."

Each of those bags is 18oz of grilled breast, so a standard week would see me going through 2 bags. On the day I’m finishing off a bag, I stick a new one in the fridge and it defrosts by the next evening.

I normally don’t get so much chicken, but I found a deal for 99c a pound at a local grocery store so I ended up getting 33 pounds worth. It’s probably a little excessive, but I know that I’m going to end up eating at all, so it only made sense to prepare in advance. I highly recommend a vacuum sealer if you don’t already have one… And of course, a food scale. [Here are some of the salads I’ve made](https://imgur.com/a/Rc5WFTu). I’ve found that the best thing to do is keep them interesting, so you don’t get bored eating the same basic thing every day.

To that extent, I’ve found myself using a lot of add-in’s. Walmart makes a “great value” brand topper called “maple glazed pecan pieces with dried dates and apples” ($1.89/4oz bag). Salad Pizzaz makes a number of great ones, like “raspberry cranberry green walnut frisco” (2.89/4oz bag). Nature’s Garden makes “savory salad topper with almonds, walnuts, pepitas, sunflower seeds, and chia cheese sticks”. I also recommend craisens… If you’re feeling adventurous, you can look for orange or strawberry flavored Craisins at Trader Joe’s. Other add-ins are Napa cabbage (I usually add this to each salad since it’s so low-cal), artichoke hearts, apples, berries, etc.

I used to tried a lot of different dressings, but I’ve pretty much exclusively limited myself to Newman’s Own lately. Their Ginger Sesame dressing tastes great, and is only 35 cals per 2 tablespoons. Their light balsamic is only 45c/2T. Also, I like “Bitten” brand’s creamy lime avocado dressing (45c/2T). The only word of advice I can give is to be very cautious when using dressings, because it’s easy to use regular regular dressing and completely defeat the purpose of eating a salad in the first place, since most normal dressings have around 150 cals per 2 tablespoons.

Anyway, I just wanted to share what I do that has been effective for me. I am 3 pounds away from hitting my target goal of 165, which will be the first time that I have weighed that little since high school. I’m in my mid/late-30’s now. I went from a size 42 waist to a 32. I’ve had to buy new clothes, new belts, and yes, new boxer briefs. That being said, it’s a very good problem to have. Once I hit my target weight I’m going to start exercising more and eating more food. 

I’ve limited myself to 1500 cals per day, every day. I’m going to bump that to 2000 a day once I hit 165 to see if that, combined with exercise, gives me enough energy to lift weights while maintaining a weight of between 170-180. I wanted to get to 165 so I could adjust my eating habits and find what number works for me, which I assume will result in a little weight gain while I get used to it (that’s where the 165 to 170 comes into play). 

 Anyway, if anybody has any questions, just let me know. I hope this has been of some help to someone. I never thought I could drop the weight I did - but I did. This is going to sound corny and cliché, but “take it one day at a time”."
"Major life changes/events, 8 lb gain 😞 F 43, 5’1”, SW: 211, CW: 179, GW: 125

I’ve had the craziest last few months. In less than 60 days, the following occurred:

1. We closed on a house
2. We moved to a different state
3. I moved my father from his home to permanent assisted-living
4. I had to represent my sister in a civil court matter as her power of attorney
5. I went back to graduate school (already planned and paid for prior)
6. I had a major health scare that thankfully was only temporary and has been resolved

I had lost 40 pounds… From 211 to 171. Now I am back up to 179. I know this is a temporary setback that has come from incredible stress, not being able to work out the last 90 days like I usually do, and quite frankly running back-and-forth so much I wasn’t eating right. 

I am sure I’m not the only person who has ever gone through an incredibly stressful time like this. I know I’ll take the weight back off, that’s not the issue. How do I get over the mental dismay of those 8 pounds? 

I appreciate any insight, and yes, things are finally calming down!! (I need like 20 naps)."
"How to deal with weight plateaus Hello everyone!

I started my diet back in January where I was 194 lbs and I’ve been fluctuating around 182 lbs for three weeks straight. I have been accurately tracking my calories (using a scale to the nearest gram) and logging everything into MyFitnessPal. I am confident that I have been eating at least at a deficit of 4000 cal per week ( and that’s rounding up all the calories to the nearest 100, the actual deficit is higher). Yet, my weight hasn’t changed at all. Sometimes when I weight myself first thing in the morning, after going to the toilet, I find that my weight is higher by three to five pounds. 

As for my training, I’ve  been lifting for five to six days a week for the past five weeks, and I can see changes in the pictures I have been taking. I spend 45 minutes on the elliptical six days a week, and I know I am going hard because by the end of it I am covered in sweat and don’t have the energy to do much (which walking doesn’t do for me). 

Theoretically, I should have lost at least three pounds of fat, but the numbers aren’t moving down, and it’s discouraging when I see that the number goes up on some days. Should I consider going on a larger deficit and up my cardio? Or should I wait it out for a couple of weeks before making any changes?

Any advice or comment is appreciated."
"Should i bulk further or cut? I'm feeling very confused and overwhelmed about which to do https://imgur.com/a/aZQsrGA

Here's my body. So i used to be a sedentary skinnyfat person many years ago before i started gymming, i still am skinnyfat but with some muscles. I never ate enough so i never really gained much muscles or increased lifts. Stuck in mediocrity. Always stuck at 20%. How do i get out of 20% BF?

My lifts are bench, 80kg 5 reps. OHP 50kg 5 reps. Row 67kg with knuckles forwards 5 reps. 8 good proper pullups. Deadlift is 120kg but i'm out of weights to put on it now. Squat is too embarrassing to tell. Biceps curls 10kg for 8 reps.

If i have calculated my diet right i get 2000 calories and 200 protein per day. My height is 184cm, weight is 90kg. I have gymmed for about 3 years, i don't skip gym days besides when i am sick which is like once a year.



My routine is: monday: 5x5 bench press/OHP (alternating), 5x5 row, 5x5 squat/deadlift (alternating), 3x8 clapping pushups, 3x8 biceps curl and on OHP days it is 3x8 lat raises
wednesday: 5x5 bench press/OHP (alternating), 5x5 row, 5x5 squat/deadlift (alternating), 3x8 clapping pushups, 3x8 biceps curl and on OHP days it is 3x8 lat raises
friday: 5x5 bench press/OHP (alternating), 5x5 row, 5x5 squat/deadlift (alternating), 3x8 clapping pushups, 3x8 biceps curl and on OHP days it is 3x8 lat raises

Question is to eat more and reach 100kg bench press, or cut and actually look good naked?"
"Accountability post I’m so tired of myself. I’m so tired of falling into the same patterns. Here I am two months later, ready to “try again”. But I DON’T want there to be a try again anymore, 

I want to try and that’s the end. 

I feel gross in my own skin. I know it’s a little contradictory but yes, I do love myself, but as much as I think I can. And I’m tired of hearing and thinking I need to love myself now to love later. But I genuinely think I will love myself once I lose the weight. Literally every problem, every insecurity, every single breakdown I have had in my short 19 years of life has been about my weight. 

My weight is killing myself and my body slowly. My brain is foggy, I lack the confidence to make friends, I don’t even think I can even look in the mirror without recognizing myself anymore. I have been fat my whole life but I still don’t see me. 

How do I stop starting over and make it stick? I just want to live my life happy while I’m young before it’s too late"
"Weight Increase, help! 16F SW: 176lbs CW: 155lbs GW: 140lbs

Hey guys. I’ve been losing weight for a good 4 ish months now and I’ve become familiar with how my body reacts when I eat a certain way or how long I hold water weight. Typically, I eat more around maintenance on Saturdays and I still lose a pound a week consistently. I usually gain like 1-2 pounds water weight after that said Saturday which I’m used to and it goes away after 2-3 days. However, I did my typical maintenance day Saturday and put on a bit of water weight, but that was gone by Monday and I was at my current weight. It’s now Tuesday and I stepped on the scale and I’ve gone up two pounds which is really weird for me and how my weight fluctuates. I’m not panicing too much because it’s probably just water, but I’ve been eating in deficit perfectly since Sunday so I’m confused why it’s jumped up all of a sudden. If anyone has any explanations as to why this has happened please let me know! Thanks so much :)"
"weight plateau, ugh hi all! first off, this sub is amazing!!

this post is kind of a rant, and also me looking for advice.

i’m F 5’2’’, and i’ve been doing CICO for a few months. my SW was 148 and i’m currently at 129. this is great progress, but i’ve been hovering at 128ish for the past 3 weeks! i’m on a 1200 calorie diet and i’ve gotten back into running, usually running 4-5 miles 4-5x a week. i know my calorie input is low by usual standards, but i don’t feel hungry and if i do, i don’t hesitate to eat a healthy snack. 

why does weight loss stop suddenly? i know i’m short and weight loss is already hard, but my running endurance is improving and its getting easier, i’m on a low cal diet and still the scale doesn’t budge. i’m not super focused on numbers, but i’d still like to see a general trend. do i increase exercise? i’m not sure what my next steps should be. thanks all and happy losing!"
"Checking in! (Trigger warning ED) Hey all, I’m here to check in! It’s been a crazy few months.


I’ve got good news: I haven’t binged since my last check in! I have spent the last month going into a deficit and have lost almost ten pounds.



Now the bad news: I’m pushing hard, because I had blood work done and my a1c hit 5.7. I am officially prediabetic. I’ve spent the last month busting my butt to get this weight down. I refuse to become a diabetic. I refuse. I don’t want my daughter to grow up with her mama being type two. Hence the sudden weight loss. 


I am currently sitting at 212.4 as of yesterday morning.  I am trying to lose two pounds a week until I hit 200, then I’ll be happy with 1-1.5. 


I’m tired all the time and very weak. With my doctors monitoring me, I’m eating between 1400-1500kcal a day. I am just under 5’3 and female. It’s hard, but i have to do this. I miss feeling sexy. I miss my husband scooping me up. I miss being able to run and bike. (We’ve taken up both. I can do about a mile of each before I can’t breathe anymore.)


So. Wish me luck!  Also if anyone would be willing to be mfp accountability buddies that would be awesome."
"I wont do it anymore im done with losing weight and stressing over it. im so done. i lost 20kgs in around 10 months and that is the only thing that is impressive. the fucking number. i still look like shit and feel like shit, even though i dont eat like a pig anymore. my body fat percentage is 15% and i look like a package of cottage cheese that somebody stepped on. my bmi is 20. if ""skinny fat"" had an antonym like a skinny person that looks fat it would be my physique. i just dont know what to do anymore. i started going to the gym and plan on bulking up just to see where that takes me. for now this is my shoulder to cry on. reply if you want to, i cant really tell you what to do."
"Lost 100LBS, but now I'm stuck. Help. Last summer I did it. I hit the 100lbs lost mark. I made it from 283, to 183 which also put me - just barely - in a normal BMI. It took a year and a half.

Since then I've been struggling to lose the last 10-15 lbs I'd like to lose. My weight has been pretty steady around the 180-183 range, once dropping down to 177 but I always put those few pounds back on. Watching the scale go down that first year and a half was like a drug. It was what kept me going. Now that it's barely moving I've had a more difficult time. It's not just that. This past year has done a whammy on the positive and healthy habits I gained. Couldn't go to the gym, so I bought dumbbells and a yoga mat and started working out at home. That went great for a few months and then I got in a bad car accident. The concussion took 2-3 months to heal.

Worked on getting back to my exercise routine and then I started to have back pain (It ended up being a UTI that cleared up with antibiotics). 

Got back on track again, and then I got covid. Really really easing back into things after that. I had it a month ago and am pretty much  back to normal but I've read articles about people going too hard after recovering and then relapsing. I don't want to risk that.

But it's not just having the exercise. I am 'treating' myself way more often than I did in that year and a half. I know if I could just cut that out things would be better. I just ate 1000cals worth of jelly beans in one sitting. After Christmas, I brought a bunch of discounted chocolate. I always have the best intentions. I'll buy this thing and expose myself to this food trigger and I'll get better at my control.

It never quite works out that way.

I know I need to have self compassion for myself and not let things like this send me into a spiral, but it scares me. I was so fat. I know the statistics, most people gain it all back and more. I don't want to go back, but I don't know how to get out of this rut. It's like I lost grip of that rope I used to find my way through the darkness for the first year and a half, and I can't find it in the darkness."
"Maintenance phases between weight loss phases Do/did any of you take any maintenance time in between periods of weight loss? Ive been listening a lot to Mike Israetel lately and saw pretty much all of his videos on fat loss, and he recommends a 12 week weight loss of 1% per week, followed by 8 to 12 weeks of maintenance to avoid burning out and bouncing back up in weight. Seems pretty reasonable on paper, but i find it kinda odd that i just heard about it now, when ive been learning about weight loss for a couple of years (maybe it actually makes sense that i never heard about it because i keep bouncing back up after i lose weight...). Anyways, anyone heard of this method? Anyone tried it?"

I went to the store yesterday to exchange a shirt and a pair of khakis. The khakis *technically* fit fine, but they weren't as roomy as I liked them, and I already had a shirt in that color.

A year ago, buying clothes was a **nightmare**. It was super stressful, and I ended up basically having a ""uniform"" - jeans, a tee-shirt, and maybe a flannel or hoodie. It was super hard to find clothes too - I often went store to store, picking up whatever stock they may have in my size. I also didn't feel super confident in what I wore, and my chances of getting properly gendered was probably a 50/50 shot.

As I've lost weight, I've started incorporating... fancier clothes? Not really fancy, but I'm wearing more button-ups and I've started buying actual pants. I've also been incorporating clothes that would normally make me dysphoric, like button-ups with tiny floral detail or more tailored pants.

And holy cow! I feel ***way*** more confident! Not just in how I look, but overall. I feel more confident speaking up in classes, walking to the coffee shop, going grocery shopping... I also get misgendered less! Nowadays I'm probably gendered correctly 80-90% of the time.

I will also say it's way easier finding clothes. When I went to the store yesterday I was actually kind of overwhelmed with choices for shirts! Pants are still somewhat tricky because of my height, but it wasn't like I only had a couple of options. I ended up also impulse-buying a sweater. It's not a sweater I'd normally wear, but I absolutely *love* how it looks on me.

It's crazy. I'm not even at my goal weight yet, but I'm super happy with the amount of confidence I've gotten! This feels great."
"Did I slow down my metabolism? Hi, I’m a 15 year old girl with a 177cm height (about 5’9.5) and I weigh 62kg (136.6lbs). My body fat percentage is about 21%.

In the summer of 2019, I struggled a lot with my self confidence and I felt that I was too fat, even though I had a BMI around 18-18,5. I didn’t eat a lot through out the day(it wasn’t really bad, maybe around 700-1000kcal, but still too little) at some point I kinda forgot about it, If that makes sense, I didn’t really think about my weight too much anymore.  

Now, since July maybe, I’ve started to get those thoughts again. I think it’s also because my two friends both also eat very little, one of them talks to me about it a lot and the other is even diagnosed with anorexia. 
It’s definitely not that I want that, but I think it has triggered something. (They both don’t know that I struggle with these insecurities)

Since then I started counting calories again. (I didn’t count calories in the time between summer 2019 and summer 2020, so I don’t know what I ate in those days). 

Some days I eat 700 kcal and some days I eat 1800.. I know that’s not good, and I really want to fix it. Therefore now,  since a few weeks I’ve been trying to eat 1500 kcal daily, but I want to eat more. I don’t necessarily want to lose weight, but I do want to lose some fat around my belly and legs, how do I do this? 

And I also have the problem that I’m not hungry a lot.. When I eat it’s just because I’m craving something"
"Calorie tracking and eating healthy is harder when living with my boyfriend 21F, 5'8"", SW: 177, CW: 170, GW: 150

My boyfriend started off really supportive of me trying to lose weight and eat healthier. It's been almost exactly a month since I started. Last night he told me something along the lines of ""I think it's really great that you're eating healthier and exercising and tracking your calories, but it's really starting to drive me crazy."" This is because he does most of the cooking but I have to scan the barcodes on everything and I'm like ""how much butter did you just use?"" or ""can I assemble my enchiladas? I need to weigh what I'm putting in them."" I don't mean to annoy him, but I need to know everything I'm putting in my body. He also won't measure things even though he knows I need to know how much it is. I don't think this is malicious. I think he just doesn't consider it, but it'll be something like ""hey, how's much cream cheese is in the sauce you made?"" ""Idk, like 2 scoops?"" Like great, I can barely estimate how much that means. 

Also, he makes eating less junk harder. A lot of people in this sub say if you don't want to eat something just don't have it in the house but I'm not going to dictate what my boyfriend can and can't eat. He has stopped getting hostess snowballs at least, which is nice. Thankfully I don't drink soda because there are literally 48 cans of diet coke in our apartment. A bigger problem than what he buys for himself is what he buys for me. The other night he bought me gummy bears for no reason because he knows I love gummy bears. It was really sweet of him but I don't want to eat candy right now.

Did anyone else have similar problems or have advice?

ETA: he just texted me that he got Lose It! and is going to start tracking his calories. So maybe problem solved?"
"I feel unable to get started Hi there. Long story short. I (F, 39, 159m/5,2f/71Kg/156lbs) quit drinking almost 4 years ago. Last year I went on CICO and sport several times a week and went from 81k/178lb down to 66kg/145lb. But covid and then Christmas helped me go up to 71kg again. I'm trying to get back on track but, and I guess this is still a remnant of my addictive tendencies, I go back to craving bad stuff in the evening (crisps, candy, chocolate) which has somehow become a ritual, a reward system and a release. It's horrible, because 1 hour of ""happiness"" in the evening destroys all my long-term goals. I feel ashamed and have gone back to hiding my body. I tried other reward mechanisms which never stick. Any suggestions? I've been able to do this before, why can't I now?"
"60 pounds down and I feel stuck. How do I get past this bump? Hey everyone,

For the past couple of weeks my weight has been fluctuating and staying around the same place in a way that I have not seen through my entire journey of losing 60 pounds. 

 I’m including my weight log at the bottom to illustrate this better but I essentially feel as though I am not losing weight and not able to move onto the 220s and just continually moving up and down in the 230s. To give some context about my diet and exercise: I am a 6’2” on a calorie deficit and light exercise. I try to eat 2000 calories a day - sometimes I eat less than this but never more. I watch my sodium intake to reduce water weight (but honestly I love hot sauce so this is difficult sometimes and it may go over slightly 1-2 days of the week) I start out every morning with a walk that burns about 150 calories and I’ve started to jog as well. I very rarely have cheat meals (maybe once a month) 

My nutritionist told me that if I don’t eat my recommended calorie amount my body will retain fat, so I’ve started to try to get as close to that 2000 calorie goal as possible. I have also started jogging to build muscle mass so my body can metabolize better. Despite doing all these things that I did not do to lose my initial 60 pounds, I’m finding it impossible to move past 230. Please, if this is normal or if you have any advice whatsoever, please let me know. I’m feeling so stuck and feeling discouraged.

Attaching my weight every morning at 8:00 for last week and this week. This has been with me eating 1400-1900 calories a day, exercising, and watching my sodium. I’ve been in the 230s for about 4 weeks now. 

Monday: 232.1
Tuesday: 233.1

Friday: 231.6

"Weight continues to go up but I've been working hard Hey, 

1 year ago I lost 14 kgs in 5 weeks with minimal activity and by simply eating a lot less and cutting out all junk food, and it paid off. I fit into all of the clothes I owned again and I was completely fine. During quarantine last year, I got lazy and slacked off a lot and I put on the 14 kgs that I lost plus an additional 2 kgs, so in total I gained 16 kgs, which is the most I've ever put on (I'm 22 years old). 

Now I know exactly how my body works, what I can and can't eat, what will ruin my diet and what won't, and so on. And I'm going to be completely honest, in the last 32 days I have not bought any kind of fast food whatsoever, but in those 32 days I can remember eating a bit of junk food 4 times but not enough that I completely ruined all of my progress. I've been going to the gym now 5 days a week, lifting weights consistently for 12 weeks and I've made some significant growth in muscle, but my weight just continues to slowly go up and I have no idea why. I started the gym at 94 kgs and I now weigh 96 kgs. 

I know for a fact that my last 2 - 3 weeks of eating have either matched my eating from 1 year ago when I lost weight or it has actually improved in comparison. I bought calipers 2 months ago and I tested them around 10 times using proper methods and the results ranged from 21 - 24% body fat percentage, with it being more consistent somewhere in the middle. I just checked again now that I know how to use them and apparently I'm at 19.3% body fat, and my bluetooth scale says 19.7%. I don't feel like I've lost body fat at all, and I'm struggling now more than I have before and not sure what else I should be trying. Thanks"
"Don't have anybody else to share with, but week one was a success! Trying to lose weight in the middle of a pandemic, while depressed, planning a wedding, and working a very stressful job is maybe not the best idea. Especially without much of a support system. Especially especially as a woman with a very small frame, so my calorie deficit may need to get fairly intense to hit my goal weight. But I'm so tired of feeling like I can't buy clothes because they all look terrible on me, and hating photos of myself.

Anyway. Week 1 was successful, I'd say! Lost a couple lbs, probably all water weight, but it was nice to see on the scale regardless. It gets harder from here and I'm hoping I can stay motivated for the year or so between now and when I want to hit my goal. I'm trying to be really easy on myself, not counting every single exact calorie and instead just giving myself a solid idea of my overall calorie intake for the day. If I go a little over, fine, no worries. I'll probably be a little under on a different day. I have a year, it'll balance out. If I get too exacting, as I've done in the past, I know I'll just burn out and quit.

It feels stupid and awkward to post about this or talk about but also sucks to feel alone in what I'm doing, so... hi! Wish me luck.  


Edit: oh my goodness, thank you for the awards!! But please spend that money on yourselves, friends. "
"Does anyone deal with anxious hunger? What's your advice? 29F, I have always been overweight and am bordering now on obese. I have anxiety and ADHD and a good medication for it now, which helps with impulsive or entertainment eating. The thing is, once I start cutting back foods or even tracking calories, hunger makes me genuinely anxious. Sometimes I shake or feel like crying. I struggle to stick to any calorie goal-- right now I want to stay under 1900 and often I'm hungry after the calories are gone. The more days I spend in a deficit, the more emotional I usually get. 

I'm trying to focus on just tracking calories so it won't feel like such a burden. But I know I need to have a calorie deficit to lose weight. I'm trying to cut back on sugar because I know it must be making my blood sugar up and down-- so tough because carbs at what I crave most!

Does anyone have advice for the emotional drain dieting can bring on? Success stories make it seem like it was just a long-term, boring project and for me the food and lack thereof makes me really emotional. I don't think it's just a matter of willpower or eating cucumbers all day as they haven't worked for me in the dozen attempts in the past. Being hungry feels like the beginning of a panic attack. 

Thank you in advance for your advice! Looking for a sustainable solution."

Usually, I cheat with 1800g of baked spinach (400kcal), some salt, and garlic, with a sprinkle of cheese (\~100kcal).   
Or I would have 300g of lean peppered fillet mignon steak (\~800kcal) and a toss salad bowl (110kcal).  
Or 3/4 of a rotisserie chicken (\~800kcal) and toss salad bowl (110kcal). 

These cheat meals made me feel so much better for a couple of days so I can stick to the diet on the next day but it keeps repeating. 

Does anyone have suggestions for me?"
"Weight Loss Help/Tips Hi guys i’m just looking for tips/help. Please point me in the right direction if i’m in the wrong group! 

-I’m 20, F, 5’6, 160 pounds. 

-i would like to loose 15 or so pounds before summer. 

-i’m pretty bottom heavy but still would like my arms to be a little thinner, but i’m sure they will thin out once i begin to loose the weight. 

-I also do not think i eat enough during the day and that’s why i have gained so much, because when i would eat it would be fast food. 

-I don’t drink sodas 

-i just got a gym membership and w will speed-walk/run for about 30 minutes, then follow a 25 min or so video that day for core, legs, arms. (i alternate). i have been going for over a week now 3-4 times a week

-i do not like chicken, i’m not vegetarian, just don’t like chicken haha, so i try to get my protein thru shakes with added peanut butter

thanks in advance(:"
"Need Help as I am not seeing results not sure why... Hey all,

So roughly about two week ago I posted this on the IF page and CICO page seeking some help, didnt really get a clear advice, so please read on and advise if you can.

Need some advice, I am trying to lose weight but whatever I am doing isnt working out.

Been in the gym for 5 weeks now, i have been tracking my food and I am getting in roughly 1400-1600 cals a day ( I am 6'4"" and 113kgs) and drinking 2L for water a day ...plus I am going to gym 5 times a week.... 3 days are cardio and 2 days are weight training.

My gym sessions are anywhere between 45-55mins and my bpm is between 135-145 through all my sessions ...I roughly burn between 650-800 cals in these session (all the data from my watch).

I take weekends off to rest and maybe enjoy 1 meal that is something like a burger, pizza, fried chicken, dumplings etc you get the point but its only one meal in the weekend of the type.

Doing 16:8 (16 fasting 8 eating)

But my weight is exactly the same and has not budged .... measurements around my arms, waist and thighs are no different either.

I cant figure out what I am doing wrong.

Adding to this - since posting this I increase the calories and am getting in roughly 2000 cals now ...have not seen an increase in weight yet, but I dont want that anyway.

Edit - have taken measurements and everything is the same around arms, neck, stomach, thighs, hips

Also did get my blood tested as well and everything came back fine with nothing wrong"
"Smoothie Controversy and Insulin Spikes. Help! Hey everyone, I'm a bit late to this whole debate I know, but I'm trying to inform myself as best as possible about different approaches I'd like to try to clean up my diet. In particular, I'm wanting to add smoothies to my diet. I cannot, for the life of me, eat whole fruits and veggies. Don't ask why, it started in childhood, it's an issue, I'm working on it. But, for now I'm wanting to do smoothies so I can get at least SOME fruits and veggies in. I haven't had a single fruit or vegetable in about 6 years. The last veggie I had was in a smoothie...6 years ago. BUT, I'm really wanting to do this right, and in my google searches I came across quite a few articles stating that smoothies cause huge insulin spikes which is the issue with my current diet. I will not be adding any fruit juices, sweeteners, or milks of any kind (almond, soy, etc...) fruits will be added in moderation and I do plan to add leafy greens (kale) as well as flax, or chia and healthy fats. On one hand I want to do this right and I really want to make these changes and be proactive about it. On the other hand, I feel like fresh smoothies for breakfast are still better than the ben and Jerries ice cream I have had for breakfast lately (and sometimes lunch, followed by a Nutella sandwich. Yeah. It's bad right now). What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

OH. And this isn't a crash diet, or detox BTW. I truly just want to make this addition and cut back on sweets which are (kind of literally) killing me and causing all sorts of mayhem in my body :( "
"Losing weight is more easier when your mom is with you. So the story starts with my family, just me and mom and dad. All of us are obese, sadly. Whenever we are outside people will talk and laugh at us and it really made me mad like 'why are we like this.' Or 'I dont want to hangout with them anymore'. 

But this pandemic thought me that I should change that. And my mom joined, not that she also do 20 hour fasting and 30 mins HIIT everyday. But she does fasting and zumba everyday, she would encourage me whenever I start my workout and I would energize her whenever she dance and shout like ""Energyyyyyyy.."" or ""Breathe Ma."" Etc.  She would follow my calorie counts like 1/2 cup of rice and drink less soda even if its her favorite thing in the world. I would even scold her when she breaks her fast. And she rides all my adjustment in my eating instead of laughing at the ridoculousness of it all.


Now I lost 9-10kg while she was 4kg since the start of late January. Losing weight is not easy but with my mom, its much more fun."
"So out of shape it’s painful I’ve finally gotten to a place, at 35, where I genuinely feel comfortable with my body. I am a bit overweight (have been most of my life) but I am not worried about “how i look” anymore, I just know I need to lose at least ~30lbs to feel loads healthier. 

However, I have never been this physically out of  shape before. NEVER. I can go for a long hike or 30 mile bike ride but at a pace that’s not challenging me and flat. It’s 100% discouraging. Keeping me from joining longer, more intense rides or even going for a 3 mile runs because I’m embarrassed. It genuinely hurts to push myself and so I avoid it which leads to the viscous cycle of never working out. Bleh. To add to it, I had to see a cardiologist for pre-op surgery that ended up getting postponed but he brought up that everything is normal but I’m horribly out of shape. I couldn’t even get my stress test to 185 without stopping after 10 minutes of running at an incline. (FYI stairs are my nemesis) 

What routines have you all found have helped you get back into fitness? How quickly do you find a regular routine to stop being so difficult? I’m wondering if I can push myself with a timeline and goals to reach where I know it won’t hurt as much, that may help. 

Also, when I say “it hurts” I don’t mean muscle pain. That’s the “good” kind of pain. I’m talking about chest pain/exhaustion/breathing etc."
"Looking for an accountability partner who is also starting on their journey! 20F - HW:178lb - CW:172lb - GW:145lb

Hey everyone! 
I’ve been a member of r/loseit for forever and actually lost some weight last year (was down to ~163 with muscle) until the pandemic hit and i gained around ten pounds and lost all the muscle i had worked for. 

I’m wanting to have an accountability group chat / partner to keep each other accountable for our weight loss goals, preferably someone around my age who is also a female and is looking to lose some weight. 

I’m currently 172lb and hoping to have a fat loss of around 1.5lb/week through better eating and exercise. I track my calories on the loseit app and try to work out a couple of times a week, but I always mess myself up on the weekends and eat way over my calorie budget. 

Please let me know if you are interested in having an accountability buddy! I have around 30 lbs to lose, which doesn’t seem like a lot but for some reason it’s really hard for me mentally and I’d love to have someone go on this journey with me!"
"Wedding Dress Size (rant) I’m getting married in December. I got my dress back in January and it just came in today. Instead of being excited over getting to see it, I’m just in tears about the number on the tag. 

I put on a good amount of weight since college, and back when I started working out I was 178 (22F, 5’6’’). I’m down 5 pounds now thanks to Beachbody (I know, I know, an MLM) but the accountability, workouts, and recipes work for me. But now after seeing my dress I just want to throw in the towel. I know I’ve made some progress, but I’m terrified to try it on. What if I just hate myself in it on my wedding day? I don’t want to keep trying just to end up disappointed. 

I feel like I’m weak for feeling like this. How do you keep yourself on track when all you want to do is quit?

"Secondhand embarrassment, anyone? I have lost 38lbs since last year (F25, 5’4, SW 206 CW 168) and lately I’ve been feeling really happy and strong. I’m naturally a very confident person, pre-weight loss included. 

My friend sent me a picture from a trip in 2016 the other day (I wasn’t weighing myself but was probably around 215-220 then), and I have been so uncomfortable and embarrassed of my past self ever since. I didn’t take many pictures ever so I really have no reference of how I looked, and knowing I was walking around thinking I was so hot and fit when I actually looked like that has me wanting to crawl under a rock. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Any advice on getting over it?"
"I lost 10 pounds in 5 eating at 700 cal deficit?!! Should I be concerned? I'm 25M 175cm, 85.5 KG today (187 lbs), goal weight is 70 KG, starting weight is 88.1 KG, my BMR is 2200 my daily caloric intake is 1500 calories, and I'm losing around 2 pounds per day.

In the beginning I brushed it off the first 2-3 days as being water weight but the more I googled it the more I felt I shouldn't be losing that much or I might develop all sorts of issues like gallbladder stones or worse getting my gallbladder removed..

Do you think that I should increase my caloric intake or do you think I might have something else going on the I should be concerned about or is it normal to lose that weight at the beginning?"

Should i continue do so to lose all these fat or go straight to the local gym and asking for guidance or changing my eating habit (4 times a day, lots of carbs (rice) and fried food (crisp chiken skin, eggs, etc.), Sometimes mix instant noodle in it)?

I'm asking for a tip to lose fat and increase my stamina, just realized it recently when taking my first part time work that i'm pathetic, so my purpose for losing fat was to increase my confidence a little and be more durable when it comes to work and study at the same time.

"I am having trouble maintaining I have been lurking here on this sub for awhile and I’ve seen people talk about yo yo dieting when it comes to weight and was wondering if I could have some advice. 

I am 24f 5’0 105 pounds. Last year around this time I was 145 pounds, my goal weight was 115. I hit 115 around June last year and then tried to maintain but I lost another 5 pounds. When I checked in December I was 110, and I just got a scale to check my weight and I am 105! 

I know it doesn’t seem like a problem but I don’t want to keep loosing weight! I am sedentary (I sit in my house all day, I literally walk to the fridge that’s it) I am eating 1500 calories a day and I am tracking so I know I’m not under eating and I get at least 70-100 g of protein a day. I even got my thyroid tested and it’s normal! 

Has anyone had this happen to them? If you did how do I make it stop?"
"5’9”: From 292 to 257.6 in 3ish months (I need a little advice) Hi! I’ve been debating posting here for a while but I’m a 19 year old who is/was morbidly obese (BMI was over 43 now 38) and started the keto (though my version was more of a dirty version) back December 1st. I have been scared of diabetes and heart issues for a while now and realized I needed to make a change so I wouldn’t end up on “My 600lb Life”. I worked away from home for a month and practically lived off of Mountain Dew, Meijer cookies, and Burger King. I was extremely sedentary and realized I really was not getting any healthier.

As I stated previously, I started Keto but tried limiting myself to 35 carbs a day which f*cking sucked. I lost about 20 pounds which was wonderful but shopping for food made me so depressed. Once I plateau’d though, I got back on my bullshit and started eating carbs again. I was between 269-271 on my plateau but I luckily didn’t gain much weight after starting carbs again. I started my journey back up after a month long break and tried something new. I’m down to 257.6 pounds as I am writing this and it’s been approx. 2.5 weeks since I started back up. 

So what have I done?
Well my breakfasts consist of either oatmeal then a nature valley protein bar, or I’ll go more “traditional” with an egg, a slice of whole wheat toast, and a rice cake with strawberry cream cheese on it. I start my day off with easy calories to burn while keeping carbs the highest. Then I stop eating until 6-7 (generally I wake up at 11). I use this time in between to simply walk or just do whatever I need to do at my job (which fortunately requires standing). I will not eat until I reach 10,000 steps... that is unless my blood sugar drops or I feel extremely hungry (not boredom hunger). If I want a snack I’ll eat carrots and hummus or cheese. 

Once dinner rolls around it’s usually grilled chicken or a chipotle bowl (with cauliflower rice). I eat a filling dinner and have been attempting to stop eating by 9:00, 9:35 at the latest. 

I ask though, when it comes to exercise, how do you go about jogging? I’m so scared I’m going to have a heart attack and I just want to know how to ease into it."
"I've lost over 50 pounds since October of last year and I feel really good about it. When I [M 29] started my fitness journey last year in mid October I weighed [330 lbs](http://imgur.com/a/eclgwdN) since then I have logged over [46 hrs](http://imgur.com/a/yxCtBb7) at my gym spending usually an hour every day when I wasn't working. I usually do mix of lifting and cardio exercises each day. I caught covid last month and it really affected me so I had to take things easy while my body recovered. Yesterday was the first day I felt good enough to go back and I was shocked when I weighed myself at [281](http://imgur.com/a/Xj73aPR) almost 50 pounds lighter than a few months ago. It just really made my day and I wanted to share with someone, I hope you all reach your goals too. 😁"
"Fuck Mondays, we don't know 'em F25, 5'10, SW 171, CW 141, GW leaner and stronger

As I was approaching the one year anniversary of my weight loss journey, I had a realization. For years I’ve been yo-yoing with my weight and every now and then, whenever I would get just a hint of motivation, the first thought that would always come to my mind would be “I’ll start on Monday”. The fact that it was Wednesday when I would said that obviously led me to other five days of eating crap. I mean I was totally justified, I said that I would start on Monday and it wasn’t Monday yet. And I wondered how I couldn’t lose weight, ha.

Now, I can say that I successfully shred 30lbs off my body, despite having a few binging episode and weeks (\**coff*\* months \**coff*\*, hello summer yes I’m referring to you) where I just didn’t feel like counting calories. So of course I slipped and had to get back on track several times. Which for the record I did, sometimes sooner, other later. But guess what?

I didn’t start *once* on Monday.

Don’t wait for a new week, new month or even a new year. I know that it sounds easier, hell I dare to say tempting. To get a clean cut, starting from scratch, like it would erase all those failed attempts. It might even feel like you’re getting a boost of serotonin from the mere thought of starting on a blank page. At least that’s how I felt. But deep down you know that it’s actually harder. Because you feel a lot worst if you screw up on that specific date.

What I learned during this last year, is that you have the power to trick your brain and decide where that blank page opens. You don't have to wait for life or time to start writing your own story, you can pick up the pen and just doodle something. I'd recommend starting with: “Fuck Mondays, we don’t know ‘em”. It's worth it, I promise."
"NSV- body dysmorphia/ body positive progress. :-) [how I look today! :-)](https://imgur.com/gallery/e06HvMR)

I wanted to give you guys an update from my last post!
(If there’s a better way to do this other than commenting on that post with updates, please let me know!)

I have seen a mental shift in myself that is subtle but feels permanent. I am essentially correcting myself every time I start to engage in negative self talk. I just put a stop to it and instead choose objectivity, acceptance, being gentle with myself, and finally trying to find something about myself I can feel confident about instead. 

Having body dysmorphia is so strange, because it has this element of gaslighting that makes you question both yourself AND the people who love you. If someone compliments my body and I can’t see what they see, it makes me feel like everyone is lying to me to pacify me, and it creates baseless resentment and anger towards that person. It’s so deep rooted and it’s so hard to rewire your brain if you struggle with it. 
I am a very reasonable, rational person and I’m not quick to anger or resentment or anything like that. But I have to check myself often when people compliment me, because I have been taught by so many that my body is ugly that I have internalized it. 

I’m just so proud of the woman I’m becoming despite those fucked up mental barriers that had the potential to destroy me. I am trying so hard to love myself deeply, intimately and truly.

Today I took this picture. I’m sure I’ve lost a few pounds since my last post (as I’ve been incorporating permanent eating, mental, and physical changes into my life) but that isn’t my concern at this moment.
Instead, I’m proud that I can look at this body, post it on the internet, and say to myself, “you are beautiful and your body is lovable. There are so many things about you that are lovable! “

That’s all! Thanks for reading. :-) 💕 so much love to whoever this finds. 
Keep going! You’re so beautiful."
"Question about exercise when sore Hello. For a short preface, I started meal prepping and eating healthy foods about 2 months ago. I found out that I actually love food prepping strange enough. Anyway, I’ve had a lot less motivation to start exercising. I weigh 312LB as of yesterday, which is when I bought the scale. I don’t plan on weighing myself anymore than once a week. 

Anyway! I did a brisk 3 mile walk, some squats, push-ups, crunches, basic workouts yesterday. (Starting slow so I don’t burn myself out quickly.) My thighs are extremely sore, it’s kind uncomfortable. I planned on keeping the walks up everyday until I move onto running, but I’m not sure how smart or safe it is to do a similar walk today with my legs hurting. So would it be bad to do another 3 mile fast paced walk today? Thanks for any advice and sorry for the noob question"
"Jan 1st I stuggled to get out of the bath. Today I rowed The English Channel. I was 18st 11lbs at the start of the year.  Not sure why the bath tub was the thing that triggered me to start exercising but I distinctly recall being pissed off that I could not reach the taps and struggled to lift myself out of the tub.

I started indoor cycling and rowing, I have dropped 14lbs and today I rowed 35,000m for charity; the width of the English Channel.

I am still way too heavy but I proved to myself that I can put the hard work in and now I believe I can go all the way to target weight by the end of the Summer.

Set goals, work hard, support each other and you will get your rewards!

PS I am writing this in the bath tub after almost 3 hours on my rower.  I suspect it will still be a struggle to get out today 🤣

EDIT: WOW so much positive feedback.  A couple of people messaged asking about the charity.  It's Cyclists Fighting Cancer in the UK, they provide bikes to kids who have had cancer.

"Starting my weight loss journey and I'm excited! I started my weight loss journey 6 days ago and I am loving it so far!

On day 1 I (25F) weighed 17st 10lb, and ive already lost 4lb as of yesterday. 

Ive always been a big girl, although i did really slim down and was quite skinny between the ages of 12-15, but then on birth control the weight started creeping up. I had a baby in Nov 2019 which resulted in an emergency c-section and that has messed my stomach area up as you can imagine, because of that and being a first time mum along with covid i just piled on the pounds. I have been feeling so down, lost all of my confidence, and ive been so desperate to lose the weight but i just didnt have the drive and willpower to do it. In January my partner began his weight loss journey, he has been eating clean and goes out running 3/4 times a week and so far has lost a huge 2st 7lb. Im so happy for him and quite envious, its seeing his hard work and enjoyment that has nailed it in my head that I am finally ready to start my journey. 

I have joined Apple Fitness+ and im really enjoying it at the moment, especially the dance workouts, they are so much fun. Surprisingly im really enjoying the clean eating too, something ive never liked before, which to me, shows that this time i am really ready for this. I cant wait to start seeing results, however long it may take. 

Not really much point to this post I just cant contain my excitement!"
"Lost +100lb but still feel like #£#£ I used to weigh 138kg and then managed to get down to 94kg and got stuck. Felt great physically but mentally it was worse than when fat, my body was ruined due to loose skin / residual fat (not really sure which). 

I keep trying to loose the last 3kg to get to 91kg which would put me at normal weight but in the last year I've lost control of it and everything I try seems to just make the situation worse. Now I weigh around 100kg and feel worse than ever. 

I've tried keto (the worst of the worst), trying to be anarexic by going on pro Anna websites (didn't work just made me feel sick), vegan (didn't work) and body building (didn't work but did make my body look a little better due to increased muscle mass). 

I feel like total shit and a failure and don't know what to do now. I've tried everything to look good but it's not working. And I'm too scared to get plastic surgery to fix my body and now I'm even gaining back weight despite constantly trying new diets which somehow work for other people but just screw me over. 

Where do I go from here.

Edit: I'm a guy who's 6""3"
"I chugged down my Slimfast shake like it was a cup of water on a hot day... I am trying to get back into IF, and figured why not try out a meal replacement shake for lunch. I always eat a big dinner and have lots of heavy whipping cream in my coffee, so I am not worried about being low on calories. I am just trying to control my appetite and eating, and stopping binging. I know the shakes have sugar, and I am not really wanting to hear opinions on the healthiness of the shakes. lol. Its just a way to help me get back on track...

What my question is, is 8 oz of milk and a scoop of the shake mix REALLY supposed to be a meal? 8 oz comes out to a cup of milk, and my shake didn't even fill my glass half way. How is a cup of milk supposed to be a meal? I blended it up in the blender with whole milk and didn't have any ice on hand but have read that some people add ice to make it thicker. 

Am I doing meal replacement shakes wrong, or do other people do two servings? I can see myself being ok with two servings but then doesnt that defeat the purpose of a meal replacement shake? I had different expectations when I bought this. I pictured 8 oz being a lot more than it actually is. I pictured myself sipping a shake over the course of 20 minutes, not making something I can chug down in 2 minutes."

"Biking is harder than I thought (a simple question) I have been looking forward to riding a bicycle all winter, so much so that I bought a bike trainer so I could ride indoors! The bicycle I have been using is just a “Next” brand bike a relative had sitting in their garage. I’m don’t know how else to explain this very simple fact: the seat hurts my butt. Like it really hurts. I know it’s not the exertion, because I’ve been doing leg days regularly and this is no muscle soreness. It’s like the inner part of my butt is bruised. I tried making a cushion to sit on while biking and it didn’t really help. The pain has become so much that I haven’t been able to bike in a few days because sitting is so uncomfortable.

My question is: would the solution to this be as simple as getting bike shorts? Or do I need a special, more accommodating seat? [WOC, blessed with some 🍑 so even if I lose a good amount of fat, the butt is staying]

Edit: Update- Hi, everyone! Thank you for all the advice and feedback! I had no idea this was a common thing! I really appreciate all the comments and encouragement. I think my plan will be to try to stick it out for two more weeks or so and see if there’s any improvement; if not, then I will look at getting some padded shorts if they are truly needed. Thank you so much!

Edit #2: Electric Boogaloo- Rode my bike today, no 🍑 pain!! (My legs on the other hand... oof) who would have thought? Hopefully I can still use my legs tomorrow"
"Hitting a Wall I successfully lost 19 pounds. My starting weight was 199 which scared me. My company offers a program called Real Appeal to anyone who desires to lose weight. The program is healthy and promotes good diet and exercise without any gimmicks. I'm so happy with the results so far because I lost 20 pounds in a month in half. The frustrating part is that I hit a plateau for the past two weeks. I can't get past 180 for the life of me. I try hard to celebrate the victories but I'm itching to lose more. 

The program offers a diet plan that is 1,250 per day. When I was eating only healthy foods, I actually found it hard to eat that many calories in a day. Now, I'm a little hungrier because I've adjusted to this diet. I still don't eat above 1,300 or so but I think my body hates me for not eating more in the beginning. I've made it my goal this month to track my calories and make sure I eat enough each day. Any advice? 

FYI: I think I'm good on the exercise portion of my weight loss. I go for three 30-min walks a day and do two 15 min work outs."
"TDEE - 500 or TDEE - 20% -- Which one to lose a pound weekly? Hi all,

My fiancee and I have been doing HIIT cardio and dieting the past 2 and a half months and seeing good steady weight loss (around 8-10lbs each), but we've gone kind of slow the last couple weeks.  I decided to recalculate our TDEE.

Using a fat caliper to calculate body fat %, we estimated that we were about 19% (me) and 26% (her) respectively.  Wanting to cut down that to a more fit range, we decided to recalculate our TDEE and found that I'm somewhere in the range of 1930 cal for maintenance, while she's at 1671 for maintenance.

We've been doing the TDEE - 20% for the past while and its been great though slowing down.  Recently we found a lot of places saying TDEE - 500 cal.  Which one is it?  Any other tips for consistently losing weight to get to a more lean body fat %?

Edit: 21M, 156 lbs, 19% body fat; 22F, 141 lbs, 26% body fat.

Thanks!"
"New User, Old Loser... hello! Hi everyone;

I’m joining this community after googling my specific weight loss questions, and adding “reddit” at the end. I’m happy to be here, and please know that I like and appreciate all that you’ve got going on here!

Nothing crazy is going on with me, it’s a rather typical story: I was fit most of my life, I used food as a coping mechanism in my late teens-early 20s, and it hurt my body while also not helping my feelings.  Thankfully I’ve broken that reliance on food for emotional stability, and have replaced it with much more productive strategies. 

I’m a 5’9 female, and 24 years old. At my highest, I was 271.0 pounds. Right now, I’m 234.6 pounds.  I hope to hit 160 by Galentines Day next year... I’ll share the story about that specific date soon enough!

I’m proud of myself for the progress I’ve made, and wanted to join a group where I could share my accomplishments along with my struggles. You guys get it, and I hope that seeing your successes and struggles will help me feel less like I’m the only one who struggles with their weight. 

I can’t wait to celebrate our victories!"
"Total meltdown this weekend I only weigh myself once a week, because it affects my mood so much. On Friday, it was 2 pounds higher than it should have been (and that is about 6 weeks worth of progress for me, just gone in an instant). Coupled with the news that my ex is getting re-married, it sent me off the rails. I binged like a crazy person, I must have eaten a weeks worth of calories each day. I want to do what everyone says and just put it behind me and get back on track. Do I need to just stop weighing myself since it was such a trigger? But also, it was such a stress free weekend that I kind of just want to give up entirely. Counting calories, white knuckling cravings, forcing myself to work out everyday, is so stressful and tiring and it was such a relief to not go through all that. Plus, I slept better this weekend than I have in a very long time. I want to lose weight, but maybe it's not worth the trade off in mental health?"
"NSV I can fit back into my old roller skating/roller derby safety gear. When I gained all my weight, I had to buy all new gear. Everything except the helmet and last week I had the brilliant idea to break out the skates in the nice weather for some exercise and for fun/torture try on the old safety gear.. Well...all the old gear fit again. I lost enough weight and/or tonned enough muscle to wear my old equipment. I may not look like my old self yet but it help me feel a little bit more like her for just a second.


Edit for details:
I am a 34 y/o f. I gained my weight due to a combo of health reasons. Hypothyroidism, PCOS w/insulin resistance, life long exercise induced asthma. Due to the weight gain, I also developed more health issues like sleep apnea, high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, high- cholesterol. When my thyriod went to hell I gained over 100 lbs fast and I knew I need help. I found a group of doctors who are great. My main one for this is my Endochrologist. They treat my thyriod, PCOS ,blood pressure, cholesterol, pre-diabetes, insulin resistance. I take Metformin and triosint. We have lowered the cholesterol by diet instead of medication. My PCOS is ""managed"", I am out of the pre-diabetic range. Blood pressure is controlled with medication but meds have been lower as weight lowers."
"I am always really hungry on a cut. I did everything to mitigate it. Do I just suck it up? I'm not bitching or venting I'm just genuinely curious

I'm 5'11 and 240 pds. I am very fat. 

I increased my calories to the max level I could lose weight with. I included more whole foods and fiber. I took dietary supplements. I ate at different times at the day. Drinking more water

I tried numerous techniques. and I noticed this is at any weight. The same thing occurred when I was cutting at 220, 200, etc.  I was still hungry as complete hell. 

Some people genuinely feel almost nothing when they cut. My friends have no issue and cut with ease. Me? I'm always hungry.

Always hungry. 

I think I just need to accept the pain and push through. Idk if anybody can relate though"
"What's a good protein powder/ drink? 28/F, 5 feet 7 inches, 275 SW, 273 CW, 175 GW. Was laid-off back in February 2020 due to covid, so not a lot of physical activity. 

Hey everyone, so I'm trying to start my journey into losing weight. My dietitian said I need way more protein in my diet. I'd love some suggestions on a good protein powder or a protein drink I can have either as a meal replacement or just in addition to a meal. I have a bad sweet tooth so if I could find one that has a good taste more on the sweet side, but doesn't have added sugar that would be amazing. Any other tips on good sources of protein that I can add to my diet would be awesome thanks!"
"What I Learned After Taking a Diet Break When I started trying to lose weight in earnest, I wanted to put everything into it - unlike the previous attempts, this was gonna be my do or die moment. Fortunately, by educating myself and having all the time in the world to meal plan and workout (a small personal benefit of the pandemic), things clicked this time and I managed to lose 80lbs between June 2020 and January 2021 ([before and after pics here](http://imgur.com/a/vophosD)). 

By the time January rolled around, my weight loss slowed to a crawl. Even as I continued to lower my intake in relation to my lowering weight, it became harder and harder to make progress. I was stubborn, though, and the idea of taking a break felt like giving up or giving in to laziness. Finally, I started to feel weak during workouts and my performance suffered, so I decided to eat at maintenance during February and resume my weight loss in March (note: I maintained my same work out routine the entire time). Now that I've been eating at a deficit for a week, there's a few things I've noticed:

* You know that woosh of weight loss you see when you first start out? You can do that again after a break. I lost 7.5lbs my first week back at a deficit

* ""Normal"" portions seem so much bigger after eating at a deficit for so long. I was able to eat a balanced diet while also drinking normal soda and eating candy a few times a week. It's reassuring to know that when I'm satisfied with my weight and eat at maintenance for good, I can eat junk food every once in a while because I know how to budget calories and adjust my other meals to accommodate for something high in calories

* If you're worried about gaining on maintenance, know that you can restrict calories for a couple of days and get back to your ideal weight. I gained 4lbs in February (probably mostly water weight), and it took two days to get back to my lowest weight

* It's easier to eat at a significant deficit when you have a defined timeline; sometimes it's hard to stick to eating at a deficit when you don't know when the diet is going to end and you might start falling off and going over on your budget. I know I was more and more resistant to eating below 2000cal/day as I hit month eight of weight loss. Now that I've taken a break, I'm comfortable eating 1700cal/day until my end date in June

* You may be hungry again when you end your break and are eating significantly less. Thankfully, that goes away, as it always does when you get used to eating at a deficit

* Eating at maintenance did fix my workout issue. I was more energized when I ate more, and now at my current calorie budget, I can still workout at peak performance 

In closing, hopefully this helps people who are stubborn like me feel better about taking a break from eating at a deficit. It's not giving up or wasting time - it may actually make the process MORE efficient! I'm also going to try out ""refeeding"" by eating a controlled increase of carbs every other Sunday in order to encourage leptin production, which will hopefully prevent plateauing. This is a different way of having a ""cheat day"" but staying productive. 

Any other general tips for long term weight loss are welcome, and hopefully some of you find my discoveries helpful to your own weight loss journeys."
"Looking for scientific evidence of calories spent by the body on a daily basis Hey folks, how are you doing? 

Hope everyone is alright and doing great on your quests.

I'm not sure if any of you can help me, but I guess that, if I can't find the answer here, then I probably won't find it in any other community.

I'm looking for scientific evidence (scientific articles, studies) that are about measuring the calories spent by the body. How exactly are those calories measured? What techniques are used? Who did they study? When was it studied? What are the profiles of the people studied? How accurate is it? Are there discrepancies in the studies? And so on.

I expect, with the studies, to be able to completely understand HOW do they get to the point of indicating that a man in his 30 years and 170cm of height, sedentary, spends around 2.200 calories a day (just an example). I mean, I want to read the articles behind that.

Now, I know some of you might have a few answers ready, and I appreciate it. But for my particular quest, I need the scientific evidence - the studies, the articles, the results. 

I'm doing the research on my own, but seeing how the community is amazing, perhaps I could gather some good indications in here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance. Have a good week, everyone!"
"Hang in there, you’ll make it! Hey all! I’m 25F and 5’3”, SW: 153 lbs, CW: 144, GW: 130. Still got a long remainder of my weight loss journey. This is the lowest I’ve been since any weight loss undertaking of mine! I’ve given up so many times looking at the scale not budging, losing my resolve and going back to old comfortable habits. Don’t give up!! 

One thing I’ve realized is, it takes time to build up that momentum to lose weight. It took me a solid month before the pounds started just shedding off. But once you reach that sweet spot, the feeling is like no other! I’m still a little bit overweight BMI wise but I’m feeling so happy, with much more energy the best part is, I just eat in moderation so it’s not like I need to starve myself (which is awesome because I love food haha). 

For those who are interested to know, I started in December, this is my 3 month mark! I used to just run but I injured my knee so taking it a little easier by doing strength training with 3.5 lbs dumbbells. In addition to that, I just reduced the amount of junk food I ate, started eating a little more fish than chicken, and using a lot less oil / butter while cooking."
MET and actual calories burned So I have been working out now for 3 months after doing a crash diet for 2 months (I know don’t tell me it was stupid but it got me started). I have been working out mostly cardio and eating right but with how much information there is out there I’m kinda lost. I have found the MET calculators and have look at them and putting them up with the lose it app. The calculator is telling me one thing and the lose it app another. So I am 25  6’4” male weighing in at 265. On an elliptical machine I am doing 12.4 METs. On the machine it says in 30 min I burn 570 calories. That’s with a 230 watts of continuous power. Then I did the calculator and it’s telling me I’m under by 200 calories. So it should be 730 or so. Depending on my weight. My weight has been going down I was 310 when I started. I don’t want to go over my calories so here I ask what is correct and any tips. I realize that I’m not going to be loosing massive amounts of weight a week I just want to make sure I’m getting my correct calories in because I’m eating 2000 atm but Netting 1700 to 1800 with the calories burned but I could be at 1300 to 1500 calories in reality and that’s very low and explains why I’m struggling. I work out 6 days a week 2 times a day for 3 hours total. Any help would be awesome in information or where to find good information. I want to learn as much as possible. Thanks
"Does anyone else have a problem with drinking their calories ? for as long as I can remember I have been the milkshake queen , the smoothie queen , always trying the new drinks at different restaurants.  im currently on my weight loss journey and im doing what I would consider is dirty fasting.  here's what yesterday looked like for me 

430 am : coffee with almond milk and Splenda (ive been cutting down my sugar intake ) 
6 am : a bottle of water 
9 am : a bottle of water 
1130 am (lunch ) : a large coke from McDonald's (im slowly cutting out the soda ) 
1 pm : coffee with almond milk and Splenda 
530 pm  (dinner ) my grandad caught some pheasants so I made a crock pot pheasant stew the day before and let it simmer all day , no potatoes in it but heavy in the veggies , onions, carrots, celery,  zucchini,  since my calories are coming mostly from my drinking,  I allow myself to cook with more fat and didn't use the lower sodium broth  options .
630 pm : my brother and SIL came over on their way home and she is the world's best baker (honest to God my brother married Betty Crocker ) she made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies but she knew i was dieting so she made me some that were made with avocado , I ate 2 of them.  
7:  ""fasting "" starts again . 

my calorie intake was 998 yesterday,  however I did not feel tired , uncomfortable,  hungry 

I've been trying to hit the reccomended for women but when you're only eating solids once a day , its hard to hit that daily quota 




I guess what my big question of the day is ......what do you guys drink ? anyone have smoothie recipes or drink recipes that fill you up ?  what sort of meals should I be eating to make sure im meeting my caloric Intake and not heading down a path that could be detrimental to my health . 


thank you all in advance for your help !"
"Possible plateau? Also, can someone help me figure out dinner calories so I can go out with a friend on thursday?? Thank you!! Hi! It's me again lol. I've yo-yo'd back and forth so many times, and given up on diets, etc. But this workout and diet plan really seems to be sticking for me. I've lost about 20lbs in the past month, but the scale hasn't really budged this week. I've taken a couple of days to eat over calorie count so my body doesn't get used to a routine or think it's starving, but I don't go above 2000 calories when I do that. Right now, I work out every other day (and both days on the weekend so I stop sleeping in so late, it helps me with my college work). I do 35 minutes of 15 incline walking at 1.8mph and gradually lower it and speed it up after I pass the last 10 minute mark. After that, I do about 30 minutes of bench pressing, 105lbs, usually around 6 sets of 3 reps. Is it possible the scale hasn't moved much because of muscle gain? I've lost around 4-7 inches off my waist, and 5 off of my hip, so I know I'm definitely making progress. It's just frustrating to see it go up and down so much. It's something that in the past has caused me to quit, and I want to actually apply to be in the Navy, and I only have until next May realistically to hit 235. So there's no room for quitting for multiple months.  
\*\*\* I did play hockey (goalie) for the first time in months yesterday, my groin muscles are definitely very sore. Is it possible that the soreness is causing water retention right now?

Also, for the dinner calories, my friend wants to go to a sushi place. I was going to get a deep fried california roll with smoked salmon and eel sauce. Any possible estimate on what the calories for that would be? I can plan around it for the day so I don't go over 1400 calories, but I just want to see what I'm working with. I was estimating maybe 500? Sorry for the text wall!"
"I don't feel hungry anymore, instead my body starts feeling weak when I need food Hi everyone, I'm not sure where else to talk about this but considering it has to do with food and my diet I figured this might be an okay place.

Since my teenage years I've always very quickly felt weak if I didn't eat enough. Kind of light headed, but mostly that I just wasn't able to do much until I ate something again. I'm now 22 and this hasn't gone away, it's actually gotten a bit worse.

I've lost 20kg in the past 6 months and my diet is very different from what it used to be. I eat very little, but not because I want to. My body doesn't really give me the feeling of hunger anymore. Instead, I start feeling dizzy and weak. That's the moment I know I should eat. When I do eat, I eat what I can. It's not like I eat little on purpose, my body just can't take that much food anymore.

This has been very annoying, because if I don't get something to eat the moment I start feeling weak, it will only become worse. Eventually leading to me not being able to do anything, and having to be dependent on my boyfriend to get me something. This doesn't happen all the time, since I often just get food and it's okay. But this is still a problem. I start feeling weak so quickly, I don't feel like this is normal.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I can't help but wonder what's going on inside my body. I just want hunger cues again, not this annoying ""Oh guess I'm weak now"" feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Instead of getting hunger cues, my body starts feeling very weak, and the moment that happens I have to eat something immediately or I will be left not being able to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: the 20kg weight loss was intentional, as I was obese before and am now in the healthy range"
"How do I stop always thinking about food? You know that saying that men think about sex every seven seconds? I wish I had time for that, because I'm thinking about food every seven seconds instead.

I feel as though the thoughts only increase when I make efforts to cut calories and lose weight. Even know that I'm meal-prepping, I wish I could just decide what I'm having, make it, and kind of ""set it and forget it,"" but instead, I'm just thinking about the next recipe I should make, at what time I should eat my next meal, etc.

I used to think people were lying when they said things like ""sometimes I forget to eat."" How do you forget a literal biological function? Do you forget to shit, too? Forget to exhale? But with time, I realized that these people aren't humble-bragging about their virtue of moderation. They are just different from me, and many people exist for whom food is just another thing they have to do everyday, like brushing your teeth. I brush my teeth everyday, but don't think about it every moment of the day.

The only times I knew what it was like to not be thinking about food all the time were when I was on attention-related medications, like Adderall and Dexedrine. These literally caused me to forget to eat. And when I *did* eat, I'd have enough, be satisfied, and then move on to doing something other than eating. I'm still prescribed Dexedrine, but don't take it every day because I feel like I only need the boost in focus it gives me occasionally.

Right now, I am thinking about how the first thing I'm doing when getting home is having a sugar-free low-calorie Jell-O cup and a diet soda pop. A carbonated drink should fill my stomach up for a bit, and I'll be able to stay within my calorie deficit. Then I'll go to bed, because even if I think about food in my sleep, worst I can do is try to eat my pillow. But I know the amount I think about food isn't conducive to fat loss, because willpower is only so strong, and sooner or later, I'm going to crack.

Any tips?"
"Can’t decide if I want to buy new clothes Hello, everyone. 

Last April, I weighed in at 174 pounds at 5’5. Since then, I’ve gotten down to 135 as of the end of February. To be honest, I have no clue where I want to end up. I’m thinking 130, but maybe I’ll get there and want to go more? I thought I would stop around 140, but here we are. 

Here’s the issue: as we are changing seasons, I have very little to wear. I’ve been wearing sweaters that still fit because they are more relaxed. I have one pair of slacks to wear to work that are too big around the waist. The two pairs of jeans I wear to work routinely sag and make my butt look awful. I’ve been dealing with my leggings slipping down while I jog for months. 

I keep telling myself that I’ll buy new clothes when I reach my goal weight. I set out with the intention of losing 5 pounds in March to get it over with for once and for all, but I can’t do it. The bulk of my loss happened in the first six months, then it slowed—as it does for everyone—as I got smaller. The last few months, I’ve been pretty casual at eating at a deficit and doing my daily activity, and I’ve been gradually losing. 

As I’ve tried ramping up my loss these last few weeks, I just can’t seem to do it. I have had some personal things happen that have been taking up too much mental real estate to to do the really hard deficit required to get through this in a short time frame. 

I’m in my first “professional” job, and I didn’t have a ton to wear before this, but now as the weather is heating up, I really don’t know what to wear. Not to mention, I don’t have any shorts that don’t look ridiculous for the weekends. 

I’m hesitant to buy clothes that will also be kind of ill-fitting if I do lose 5-10 pounds. While my husband and I make a decent amount of money, we are in the market for our first home and we’ve been squirreling away as much money as we can, so I feel like I don’t have a bunch of money to drop on any clothes that may need to be replaced in four months, but I want to look and feel nice at the same time. 

How have you all been replacing clothes as you’ve lost weight? Do you just deal with it until you get to the “end”? Do you thrift shop? Do you just buy a few cheap pieces to get you by?"
"I'm so convinced that I'll fail, that I can't bring myself to even try. Day 1 for the hundredth time. This is hard for me to write. 
I'm a 27 year old woman living in the US with an autoimmune condition causing arthritis.
I have failed at weight loss so many times that Ive developed a ""fuck it"" mentality. 
I'm posting here because I need help. 

I started in February 2018 at 250lbs. Using keto, I got down to 195 in October of 2018. I got engaged that month, and with the stress of the wedding, cake tastings, parties, etc, I was up to 220 at the wedding in September 2019. Here I am a year and a half later, back up to 240.4 as of yesterday morning. 
I have a ton of mental obstacles so I'm going to do my best to mention them all here, so that I can address all of them.

1) TikTok and body positivity. I am inundated with plus size women looking amazing, and when I see them, I think ""well if they look hot fat, maybe I do too!"" (Spoiler alert, I don't.) 
2) 
My cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose are all within the normal ranges. So when I think about losing weight, I tell myself ""WeLl I'm NoT tHaT uNhEaLtHy"" even though logically, I know those are definitely not the only measures of health. Same with seeing other people's posts with starting weights much higher than mine. I tell myself that I could be much heavier, which, while true, is not a high bar to set for myself.. 
3) I'm incredibly good at justifying things to myself. I always say ""well one X won't hurt"". I'm huge on the ""I can start for real tomorrow"".
4) I have an incredibly unhealthy relationship with food and I need to address this one the most. I look forward to food. I enjoy it. I get excited when I know I'm going out to eat, and I look up the menu in advance and get excited about what I'm going to get. Eating brings me a lot of happiness, and due to me being pretty fucking depressed often, I eat constantly because its one thing that consistently makes me happy. More than once, I've lied to my husband about wether or not I've had dinner, etc, because I know if I say I haven't eaten, I'll get to eat again. 

I'm trying to go back to the gym but I'm worried about covid, and I'm too lazy to stick to going on walks in my neighborhood daily even though I live in a great neighborhood. I feel like I need an intervention.

I can't figure out how to help myself."
"Mindlessly eating when bored I’ve noticed I’ve been mindlessly eating or eating when I’m bored. It’s starting to affect me, as in it’s looking like I might need to buy some new clothes. Which also really affects my self esteem. 

I usually end up snacking on junk when I come home from work at night. I work 2nd shift and I’m alone when I come home and I’m too tired to be productive at that point. During the day I’ll usually combat this by keeping myself busy, but I need a solution for at night, especially because usually I feel sick in the morning if I sleep on a full stomach. 

It’s really getting to me as I just don’t know what to do. I have about a 2.5 hour span from the time I get home, to the time I go to sleep so as long as I can get through that point, I should be fine. I just really need some skills or info to put in place since I don’t seem to have the self discipline to hold out eating until morning."
"Major CICO Dilemma, Please Help I've been reading posts on here for a long time and they've been really encouraging, now I need some advice.

I'm a 42yo 5'11""M SW400/ CW 292/ GW 200. A while back, I decided to get bariatric surgery and did a lot of work with a clinic. After some really good results, I made the decision to just continue on with my program without surgery. This has been very successful, even though it's been very difficult. I was doing appointments with a dietician and bariatric nurse each every month, so everything I'm doing has gone past them. At first, I wanted to mimic the diet I would have if I had actually gotten the surgery, so I went to 1000 calories per day. The professionals said there is no set minimum for the number of calories I need per day, they were just insistent that I get enough protein, take a multivitamin, and have two servings of vegetables per day. They were concerned the calorie restriction would be too much mentally, but I've kept it up for about six months now. I was having a hard time getting enough protein, so I upped my limit to 1200, but with fairly lean sources, I usually still come in at around 1000 anyway. If I feel like treating myself, I eat an Atkins candy bar. (They're really good.)

I don't do cheat days, but I do have special meals that still fit within my limits. Yesterday I had a Popeye's breast and wing with a side of mashed potatoes. Here's the part I need help with. Because I had a rare occurrence of a good night's sleep (23-month old toddler), I decided to do [this hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/koko-head-crater-trail?u=i) that I'd really been looking forward to for a long time. I've done it at 375, 365, and 350, so I knew I could do it at this weight. When I went from 365 to 350, my time went from 52 minutes to 37, so I was really stoked to set a new record. I was moving really fast until it got to the really steep part where I started to get lightheaded. That's never happened to me before. I'm a very experienced hiker, all of that has been at much higher weights than I am now. I also have been doing hill walks anywhere form 30 minutes to over two hours. I know I wasn't dehydrated, so the only thing I can figure is that I just didn't eat enough. 

I really love working out. I'm not really trying to use it as a weight loss tool, I'm just trying to maintain muscle and make sure that I'm ready to do some activities I haven't been able to do with all this weight. I'd like to run once a week or so and do lots more hikes. The question is, should I increase my calorie intake? Should I add carbs in on workout days? Can I get enough energy from just fat? I'm generally happy with my progress, but I'm really hoping to keep this same momentum. I know my weight loss has been rapid (my starting weight was only 9 months ago), but I really want to stay on track. The months go by fast but the days drag on forever. I've had lulls as long as two weeks where I didn't lose anything.

What should I do?"
"Losing weight with 30 days fitness apps and running 5 days a week ? Hello,

First of all, sorry if this is not the correct place to ask this question or if the question was asked before. I searched on Google and couldn't find anything relevant.

As a New Year resolution ( Yeah I know, cliche) I decided to use my extra time to get in shape instead of binge watching Netflix.

I am currently using the ""30 days whole body workout"" of ""30 days fitness"" (and another app before this one) and running 9-10 km five times a week.

I am pretty satisfied with the results after approximately  3 months. My arms and my chest look nice.

However, I am struggling with belly fat. I did lose some weight but apparently not enough.

I am not particularly eating healthy but I completely stopped consuming junk food, chocolates and coffee.

I was thinking of trying the 30 days abs workout challenge of the app and still run 9 km a day.

Is this good enough to have a flatter tummy or am I being delusional ?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much !"
"(Lifting + Running + Bodyweight) Question The age old question...

Hey everyone!  I’m currently trying to hone my workout plan a bit.  For 8 weeks now I’ve been doing the Push Pull Legs workout 6 days a week without a hitch.  I added a few accessory lifts to each day and MonWedFri I added a 10 minute ab workout to the end of each workout.  So far it’s been good, but I’ve noticed I’ve actually put on about 15 pounds, and while muscle is a lot of that, I do have a high body fat percentage.  I’ve definitely changed my dieting to include more protein and not eat as much “crap” but I’m still seeing a gain in my stomach and I want to cut that down for sure.  I’m in the military and with no PT (thanks Covid) and wasting too much quarantine time I definitely let myself go a bit.  My wife and I broke down and bought a home gym with all the fixin’s so being able to workout at home has been a huge plus.

What I’m curious about is adding running as a way of cutting the fat while continuing some sort of lifting plan, not to mention its 1/3rd of the PT tests.  I’ve thought about doing morning runs on the 1.7 mile running trail loop in our neighborhood, or doing a SunTueThu Lifting - MonWedFri Running situation.  Just curious your take or anyone else experiencing a similar question.  I’m also wanting to add in more focus on push-ups, Situps, planking as well so come PT test time (July) I’ll knock it out of the park.

Currently 6’3” 225lbs. 25yo M

Any and all advice is welcome, thanks Reddit!

TLDR: Looking at a workout plan to gain muscle, Lose fat, workout abs, push-ups, planks, and I have 6 days a week to workout.  Been lifting a lot but looking for change."
"I can’t seem to stay consistent. Consistency is key in weight loss and I can’t seem to do it. I’ll be doing good for a week and then suddenly I have this uncontrollable urge to binge. I get so hungry and want to eat everything. And I don’t even try to stop myself I’ll just be like “it’s okay to over eat sometimes just eat less the next day or eat your normal calorie allowance.” I try to eat about 1,200-1,300 calories a day but I’m still hungry afterwards. Some days that satisfies me but my appetite changes so much and I think that is why I’m so inconsistent. And it seems like after I start eating a lot I can’t stop. Any advice? All I think about is food. I just want this struggle to end. I envy people who can eat what they want and maintain their weight or lose weight and also be satisfied and full. Stress also makes me eat more and it’s an endless cycle of stress eating and being more stressed because I just stress ate. Then I eat more."
"Itchy when a fat runner, itchy when a thin runner. Really putting me off jogging. I had a BMI of 32 and jogging was awful for me because it make my side and back fat, belly and thighs, super itchy. After 5 minutes of exercise I would sulk off home miserable and would scratch them until they were red raw. I thought it was because I’m so fat that the blood circulating through my fat was making me itch. 
Strength exercise always gave me injuries and I just gave up on exercise. 
Then I lost a lot of weight due to illness and also dieting/restricted intake of food. Now my BMI is 21. I feel really good and am recovering well and making good food choices. I decided to try exercise again. 
I started with ringfit for Nintendo switch. I haven’t injured myself so far and I quite like the variety and the pace. 
However! Today I decided to go for a jog. I jogged about 1.3 miles this morning. It’s not much but it’s the first time in about 10 months. I wanted to jog 2 miles but at 1 mile the itchy started again!! It was in my side fat and butt area where I guess i still carry a lot of fat. I wasn’t going to scratch myself in public and luckily I was doing laps round the neighborhood so I came home and felt sad that I got itchy again. 

I’m not even sweating. I don’t why this happens. Is it a common reaction? I’m a missing some particular vitamin or something? Any advice would be appreciated. My dads advice was just “well pet, you’re obviously not meant to be a runner. Just take the dog for a nice long walk instead!”"
"I feel like I’m starting to slip... I (27F) have been consistently logging everything into myfitnesspal for 44 days. I started at 308.4lbs, and I’m down to 291.2. This is the longest I’ve ever focused on bettering myself. But I messed up on Saturday and was nearly at my limit by 5pm, and I hadn’t had dinner yet. The two weeks before that, things really slowed down. I went from losing 4lbs/week to maybe .5lbs.

I was really proud of myself in the beginning. I was losing just by sticking to a 500 calorie deficit. I haven’t started exercising yet because every time I do, I lose motivation in a few weeks and things go back to normal. I don’t want to go back to normal. I hate that I let this happen. I have always been overweight, but I can remember my parents telling me at 145lbs that I needed to lose weight and I long to be at 145 now.

Why did I do this to myself? How did I let it get this bad? Why am I craving, and sometimes caving to, the foods that made me this way? I don’t want to hate myself, but it’s hard not to.

I don’t really know what I’m looking for, other than maybe some advice on how to keep going, accepting the bad days, and not hating the me that got me here. I want to be better."
"Monday scale rollercoaster  SW:233, GW: 190 CW:225ish. 50yo. (M)onday is very frustrating for me. It’s always my highest weigh in of the week. Total was 225, last Friday was 220. If the trend continues this week as the last few, I will lose the five pounds in a couple days and then end up somewhere around 219 this Friday.

I am not a fitness newbie. I made a deal with the devil in 2015, putting my career ahead of my health and put on 15lbs and lost a lot of shape. I started training again in 2018 and dropped about half of it. At the end of 2019, I tore both my right bicep tendons and worked around it. In March the world shut down for Covid, my arm hurt constantly, I stopped training and I put on 20 pounds startlingly fast. I started rehab in the Fall and then finally got surgery February 2021. I'm still in recovery and can't put any load on my arm until April when I start PT. 

Since January 1st, I've been 20:4 IF 5 days a week. I don't eat till I get home from work and then a 4-hour window. No alcohol since new year’s. Three dinners a week are from a meal service and less than 800kcal a meal. I cut 95% of the junk food out of my daily intake. I may have a couple of corn chips just to satisfy a 'crunch' sensation. I eat 1200 (+/- 100) a day. On weekends, I might have a breakfast, but mostly its 16:8 IF, and my calories on weekends rarely go above 1,800. 

I am losing weight and inches. I lost 9lbs in January and just over 3lbs in February. I weigh myself almost daily with Friday's as my 'official' weight of the week. Last Friday I was down 13 pounds for the year. Today that's only 8 pounds, mentally that sucks, but I've still lost 6 inches on my waist, which is cool. 

It is just horribly maddening to get on the scale on Mondays and see that number bounce over the weekend like that. I feel like I'm physically and mentally playing catch up the rest of the week. Based on my initial plan of losing 2 pounds a week from Jan1 to goal, I'm a dozen pounds up from where I wanted to be today. I think I have more heavily salted foods over the weekend and that’s holding weight on me. I will continue to trust in my eating plan, hope the yo-yo is still post-surgery transition, and keep my goals in mind."
"The First Day on My Journey to 215 Hi everyone! I’ve been in this group for a little and I’ve been reading a lot of people’s journeys to changing their lifestyles. I’m super inspired. Just quick background: I’m 26 years old, 5'7 and I weigh 289 lbs. I gained the majority of my weight after I got married due to the stress and drama of in-laws and toxicity. I love my wife but don’t love her family 🤷‍♂️. Before marriage in 2017, I was 215-230 lb maintaining my weight sometimes and I had a gym schedule where I would lose and bulk but I was comfortable. Present day, I let a lot of negative energy envelope me and began stress eating, not sleeping, no working out and I ended up tearing a rotator cuff when I started again in the beginning of 2019. Mid 2019, me and my wife left the negativity and move out and when I tell you the sun shone brighter than it ever did that day, I kid you not! 🌅 My head cleared and I started doing things I never thought I would do. I started college and I’m fast tracked to graduate in 1.5 years (this June) instead of 4 and I started doing better in my business. Made more money than I did before... unfortunately, I got sciatica at the end of 2019 🤷‍♂️. You can say, I’ve had some hills just like everyone else. I’m grateful because it could’ve been WORSE. May we all climb out the holes we’ve been in. I was been recovering in 2020 but school and quarantine made it easier to order in and not go anywhere. Today, I’m finally confident enough to bounce back! I’m ready to change my lifestyle but I want help - me and my wife have gained a lot weight and I want to be a motivational force for her and myself. Inspire me! Encourage me! I’ve bought the app Simple for intermittent fasting. I’m on my second fast day. Kinda splurged on fast food as my celebratory meal for writing 4 papers and having 9 classes left in my degree. But I’m done with that. I’m a cook at heart (dropped out of culinary school) another story for another time but I’m ready to change the lifestyle by cooking more, eating healthier. I still have back pains so walking for long periods does not feel good but I’m okay with doing push-ups, sit-ups, light squats and other manageable calisthenics. Give me tips, tricks, recipes, diets, etc. Help me succeed in my journey 🙏🏿 I love you all even though I don’t know any of you but we all have the same goal, to lead and live better so that’s enough for me 😌"
"Losing motivation to follow CICO diet after 20lbs loss... Hello everyone :)

I guess I'm just here to rant about losing my motivation... and hoping some of you might help me gain it back.

In November and December, I lost 20 pounds and went from 165 (75 kg) to 145 (65 kg) (I'm F27, 5'7). Between holidays, birthdays etc. I've completely lost my motivation to follow the CICO diet. 

Initially, I was following the 4000 kj/day, and decided to give myself some slack with the 5000 kj/day, but I wasn't losing weight anymore. I guess that's where my motivation vaned, because I was restricting myself a lot still and it didn't work, so now I reversed back to my old habits of eating whenever and whatever. I haven't gained back any weight, as luck would have it, but I still have 5kg/10 pounds to go to and I can't seem to overcome my food impulses. 

I think, one of the problem is I like how I look now, and though I know I would look better with less weight, vanity was one of my main motivation at the beginning of the diet. 

I wanted to exercise to sculpt my body but gyms are closed right now, and I work best on machines. 

Is anyone else feeling this way ? Do you have any pointers to ""get back into the game"" ?"
"Weight loss help In August 2018, at only 4foot 7inches, I was 86kgs, prediabetic and the unhealthiest I’d been in my life. I decided I needed to make a change. At first I didn’t start with anything too dramatic. I reduced my food portions, ate less simple carbohydrates and exercised three to four times a week. At this point I was quite unfit and couldn’t do all that much in the way of exercise, but whenever I went to the gym I made sure that whatever I did, I would get my heart rate up and I’d make sure I was sweaty before I left. 

By August 2019, I had gotten down to 75kgs. Although it had taken me a year, I was so proud of what I had achieved and at that point, it was the healthiest and happiest I’d felt in my life. 

Throughout 2019 I continued with the healthier eating but became more stringent and focused on watching what I was eating and by this point could do a lot more fitness wise. I would run on the treadmill, go on long hikes, do lots of strength training. I tried lots of different things and found I enjoyed it all now that I was fitter. 

However in August of 2020 I’d plateaued at 66kgs. I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong. I never took a day off. I exercised every day for over two years and nothing worked. 

My GP suggested I try the Fast 800 program by Dr Michael Mosley. With this I would eat 800 calories a day within a 12 hour period. I did this from October to December and continued with my exercise but still I stayed at 66kgs. 

I feel like I’ve had every blood test done under the sun and nothing abnormal shows up. I’ve been to an endocrinologist. They can’t figure out why I’m not losing weight. I’ve looked a bit at theories around different body types and how if you’re an endomorph (which is how I would describe my body type) this can effect the way you lose weight. 

To say I’m at my wits end is an understatement. I can’t continue to maintain the momentum of reduced calories and strict exercise regime for my entire life. Especially when it’s no longer resulting in weight loss. 
Has anyone else been through something similar? Does anyone have any suggestions that I haven’t already thought of? I’m not adverse to hard work, I just want it to work."
"Looking for Advice on Family Dinner So I am a 24 year old guy 6'1"" starting weight 250lbs and current weight 228. Been logging all of my food for over 60 days and getting little bits of exercise here and there (snowmobiling has been my go to). I seem to have hit my first wall as I am a very stocky guy who played football for 7 years with about 3 years of weight lifting/training so I have a solid amount of muscle, but still a beer gut going on. I dont blame my family at all and I am known for being the guy who cleans up dishes at the end of dinner and just eats like crazy, but since starting to lose weight I have had a hard time dealing with my family at dinner.

Worst case scenario is I bring a scale and weigh the food they cook, but I feel like that is too weird and into nutjob territory. I am very upfront with losing weight but my family always has beers with dinner and everything is sort of all over the place as far as counting goes. I dont want to starve myself before dinner in the hopes I dont go over, but I cant have 3 cheat days a week. Since covid I spend A LOT of time at my familys house over the weekends and do not want to stop as I really dont have much going on on weekends. 

Does anyone have a similar scenario and how do you deal with this? CICO 100% works it just gets overly convuluted when other people are involved. Do you just sort of take mental notes of what you are eating and eyeball quantities? I dont know how some people have their diet dialed in so well. I am a sociable guy so I dont want to stop eating my parents meals which I have no idea what they are made with. Get more involved in the kitchen?"
"Binge eating cycles Hi! I'm a 21F with a goal weight of 125 lbs (5'2). I want to ask for help on a problem I have. I will track diligently for X weeks, eat healthy, etc. Then I'll get into a mood of craving sugar and sweets and eat them whenever I can (i.e. with lunch and dinner), then get back into tracking and the cycle repeats itself. As an example, I'll also eat things like pasta with alfredo and fries and burgers more often, and more foods I would avoid normally during the craving phase. It starts as a day that becomes a week, then two, etc. It's a form of self-sabotage that I want to stop. I view this as ""relapsing"" to old habits. Also during this time, I will generally avoid vegetables and salads and opt for high calorie choices, knowing my time of avoiding these foods is near. The other night, for instance, I ate a whole order of garlic knots by myself. I'm not proud of this and am nervous about these binging habits. My scale doesn't show much gain but I know that what I am doing will lead to gain eventually and I'm worried about ill-health effects besides this (like heart problems). 

In short, I'm wondering if I have an underlying binge-disorder and why I get into these cycles. I get frustrated because this shows I don't view healthy eating (i.e. eating veggies, fruit, natural food and not as many desserts) as my default. I never really liked veggies as a kid and was always a picky eater. I'm sick of choosing unhealthy foods when part of me likes to identify as a healthy person. How do I change my mindset?"
"Finally sub 170 I’m a 5 foot 11 male and I just weighed myself for the first time in 2 weeks and I’m 168.4. Crazy to me how I’ve made this much progress, I only started my weight loss journey in late January at the weight of 189 pounds. I have been on and off dieting and failing for the past 4 years of my life and I’m so happy that I finally got the willpower to really change myself. I wouldn’t call myself at my goal weight exactly (I want to get lean and shredded) but I definitely would consider myself normal looking now. For those of you who are constantly frustrated and failing just remember you won’t be like this forever, just watch your macros closely would be my #1 tip."
"Made a happy compromise when I had intense cravings! Hi all, so I’m 20F, 180 lbs trying to get down to 130. 

Today I had the biggest craving for a veggie burger with a ton of fries.

Then I thought to myself: all those simple carbs, grease, sodium, it’s not good for you. At the same time though, I didn’t want to completely deprive myself. So I decided to make a compromise. 

I got a veggie burger w/ a small fry (no buns), skipped out on burger sauces, shared the fries w/ my s/o. I actually ended up only eating about 1/3 of the fries because the veggie patty was super filling. I also had cucumbers, tomatoes, some grilled mushrooms and some water. 

Before, I’d eat bread, rice, desserts and sugary drinks all day. Now, I’m fighting back! 

I understand this technique may not work for everyone but if you are able to, maybe try compromising/enjoying your favorite foods in small amounts to curve cravings."
"Looking for a weight loss partner - 32F, circa 10-15 lbs Hello internet denizens! 

I am looking for a person to help hold me accountable for about 10-15 lbs of weight loss. Basically, in lockdown, I have gained a little weight and I would like to lose it so I feel less tight in my clothes and have a healthier BMI. I have been doing well enough most days on exercise but my diet is all over the place - some days I am a chickpea goddess and other days more of a hamentaschen gourmand. :). It’s hard being a vegetarian sometimes as I replace meat with carbs.  I do 30 minute workouts/yoga during the week for strength training, long walks, and occasional runs. 

I guess I’m looking for someone who I can, maybe once a day, PM about weigh ins or diet, just so I feel like I should be more consistent. I’d do the same for you of course, praising lavishly for trying to be a bit healthier!  You go, girl (or dude)! 

Anyway, let me know if you think we could be a good fit. 

Cheers,
Miranda"
"Don’t be afraid to be silly or cheesy F/36/5’6”  SW:355 CW:189

So I don’t know if this will really help anyone, but I had a bit of a moment today that I thought I would share.

I’ve lost and regained hundreds and hundreds of pounds over the decades, but this most recent time I really took a different approach.  I decided that I would stick to it come hell or high water.  I would read everything I came across, and I would try every strategy.  So I did.  If I came across a motivational tool, I did it even if I thought it sounded dumb.  I had sticker charts (that didn’t last long), rewards written down for milestones (I owe myself SO MANY rewards), the two jars of marbles (I like that one better than I thought I would), progress pictures, everything.  You name it, I gave it a try.  Some I enjoyed more than I thought I would, some I stopped doing.

Well, I had forgotten that I made a “dream board.”  That’s not really my thing, but I had promised myself to try everything.  I made it as a private board on Pinterest, and it has pictures of all of the things that I could think of that were my motivations when I first started.  I did look at it a bit when I was struggling at first, but then as I got better coping skills, I stopped looking at it and forgot about it completely.

Today I came across it.  Looking through it, I have either archived or am able to achieve almost everything on it.  There are some things I haven’t actually done, but my weight is no longer a barrier to doing it.  For example, I really want to go sky diving.  Well now it’s just a matter of going out and doing it, instead of it being something I physically couldn’t do.  

If I’m being honest, when I made that board, I don’t know that I really thought I would do those things.  But being able to look back and see the things I wanted SO BAD and know that they’re within my grasp is a pretty amazing feeling. 

So the moral of my story is to try things that you think won’t help.  You might be surprised."
"NSV: today I ignored the urge to eat my favorite dessert Hey there wonderful people

Yesterday I decided for the 10th time since the beginning of the pandemic to get back on CICO. A bit of background: I'm a 46 year old dad of a 6 y.o. kid, and I've been overweight since my early teens, and obese since the early 20s. I found this sub on 2016 or so, and on late 2017 I decided to give CICO and C25K a shot, and managed to go down from 125kg to 106kg in 18 months, slow and steady. Joined a ton of 5k and 10k races and even a half marathon in August 2019 in which I finished nearly last, but I finished it. In late 2019 I started to fall off the wagon a bit but I was certain I'd get back on track in early 2020, and then covid showed up.

Fast forward to now and I'm pretty much back to square zero. I'm not sure about my weight as I'm afraid to check, but I'm sure it's over 120kg.

Looking my self at the mirror last Friday night I decided to get serious again about calorie tracking. And then today my mother in-law (we're in the isolation bubble with my in-laws to get support while my wife and I work from home) who usually cooks or orders the most tempting food decided to cook my favorite dessert, a typical Brazilian dessert (pudim de leite). It was tough to see that thing tempting me all day.

My main strategy was to pick up a book I've read in 2017, Amy Johnson's ""The little book of Big change"", and remind me that an urge is just a thought, not an order or a reason to try to ""out think"" it. It's an habitual thought which is best when it's simply discarded as new thoughts will come, our brain is a constant, random thought generator. It seemed to have helped.

Anyway this post turned out to be a long rambling. In any case here's for day 2 of my journey, I hope I have the strength to stick to it. Have a good week folks!"
"I can’t seem to stick to my daily calorie goal 38/m , 6’3 277 lbs. Supposed to be eating 2300 cals a day to lose a pound a week but I go over that almost everyday. I really have trouble on the weekends especially. I ate a whole Red Baron frozen pizza today and that fucked up my calorie counts. I can’t seem to work in my favorite foods into my diet without overdoing it. I ate like six hostess cinnamon rolls in two days. 

I get the hungriest at night but that’s also when Im the most bored, as well. I try to drink more water but I don’t seem to get thirsty a lot . I’m on the verge of giving up this calorie counting thing because I suck at it so much"
"I’m scared to swim at my gym because I’m overweight I probably gained close to 30 pounds over the year due to pandemic, major stress and depression. I joined a YMCA a week ago and it has a lap pool I want to use. I put on a bathing suit for the first time in over a year a few days ago and I was disgusted at myself. I’m scared to go out in public and people seeing me in it. 

My gym is also full of teenagers and younger people during certain times of the day because I guess when they get off from school, they all head to the Y. Teenagers are naturally immature and I wanna say I’m used to stares, but they can still really bother me.

I’m still gonna swim no matter what, but I’m still gonna feel insecure as hell. How can I get over this 😭"
"What do I do now?       In early October of 2020 I was at my highest weight ever, 175lbs. For reference, I am a 5’6-5’7 female. Right then and there I decided that I would do anything I could to get down to my ultimate goal of 145-140lbs. So around that time I started to eat less and less, and I gradually got to the point to where I now can no longer enjoy a meal, or any normal amounts of food. (Btw I exercise and burn about 300-700 cal each day.) Currently I am down -20lbs, and I’ve hit a platue. I know that eating 600-1100 calories per day is probably not helping me, but as soon as I try to eat a normal calorie intake 1500-2000 of HEALTHY foods I instantly gain weight. Im not really enjoying starving myself (big surprise) but I also do not want to gain all of the weight I’ve lost back on. What should I do?"
"Why do I keep self sabotaging by emotional eating? So far over the last year I’ve lost 20lbs, and I’m now down to my last 10lbs to lose. 

I realise this isn’t a great deal of weight, however I’ve been trying to lose it for a while now and the same thing keeps happening. 

I do good for 3-5 days, under my calorie goal, then the hunger and the need for crappy food sets in. Once I decide I want it then there’s no stopping me. 

I’m also a massive emotional eater and recently my job has been extremely stressful, that along with some other health issues and my stress has sky rocketed - along with my emotional eating. 

I will frequently binge - usually in the evenings - and immediately afterwards I feel awful, even more sad and stressed than I started. 

I know - if I’m in a deficit - I can still enjoy things like sweets and chocolate in moderation, but my brain tells me I can only binge on them. Like it’s all or nothing. 

I need some advice on how to break the cycle/habit of emotional eating and self sabotage. I know eating in a deficit will give me the results I want, so why can’t I stick to it? 

Why do I keep doing this?"
"Calorie deficit is not working, what am I doing wrong? I’m 21 F and when I began my weight lost journey I weighed 71kg, I’ve been on a calories deficit (1200) for 2 weeks and haven’t really lost anything. 

I sometimes will drop to 69 or 68kg then the next day straight back to 70, I’m strict on not going over my calorie deficit and haven’t broken it once, I have a knee injury so working out is quite difficult however some days I will use a weighted hula hoop for an hour, however I will admit I am not consistent with using it. 

I just don’t understand why I’m not dropping anything? I know you can sometimes plateau but I haven’t even dropped weight to get to that stage yet. I’m starting to lose hope if I’m honest, i know it’s only been 2 weeks but the fact I haven’t lost anything in that time is really discouraging me. 


Does anyone know why this is? 
Or have any advice on how I can change this? 

Thank you :)"
"Plateau-ing + Pain: Need some help Hi everyone!

I'm having some issues with plateauting and I could really use some advice.

Some context, I started this journey back to being more active and healthier at the middle of this entire global situation, where I moved back home for a bit. I started off at 5'8, 210, never really looking too overweight (I think it's because I have super thick muscular thighs and calves without ever doing leg days) but I wanted to get back to a healthier BMI and body fat %. 

Since September, I'm sitting around 188 (hasn't dropped past 187)  through a combined effort of daily 2 mile walks and just eating cleaner and healthier. I also suspect not drinking much at all contributed as well.

Over the past month, I've had debilitating sciatica and haven't been able to move much, much less go on walks. The kettlebell and dumbbells I purchased have just been sitting in my room because my leg pain is way too much for me to handle right now. 

Thankfully, my weight hasn't shot up and just stayed consistent but does anyone know any other ways that I can push past this plateau even without the ability to be too active right now? Is the only thing I can do cutting calories?"
"I lost 6lbs this week! [315lbs-309lbs, 5' 11"", M, 25] Basically last week I weighted in at 315lbs. This was not cool, I knew I was big but I hadn't weighted myself in a while and it was a shocker. 

I reckoned that if I wanna be the fitness guy in really good shape I need to ""be the fitness guy"" than comes the body not the other way around. So I decided to do that.

I cut my calories back to about 2400, started rowing 45 minutes every other day and the day I'm not rowing I walk 5k. I started eating keto and only eating once to twice a day with no snacking. 

So far I feel excellent! I hope I can keep it up. I haven't had this much energy before. Just wanted to post my progress!"
"How to get legs smaller? I am currently cutting and have dropped leg work in an attempt to get smaller legs. So far It looks like im building muscle in my legs without doing direct work. I'm 6ft 181lbs.

Despite losing fat everywhere my legs grew. My arms are 14"" and my legs are 23.5"". My calves are 14.75"" and I know the calves, neck, and arms should be the same size to be proportional. Legs should be 1.5-1.6x the size of calves to be proportional. All measurements being unflexed. I haven't squatted in over a year and can still manage 275x3 belt less. 

Does direct leg work help slim legs during a cut, or should I just skip legs completely to allow my upperbody to catch up."

Hi everyone! First time making a post here, but I've been lurking for quite some time. Around the early part of 2018 I got out of a long relationship and was at my heaviest weight of 265. 

I committed to losing weight that summer and was able to lose about 70 pounds doing IF 16:8 \~1500-1800 calories a day and getting into the gym 5 days a week doing cardio on an elliptical and lifting weights for about a half hour. I hadn't really had much experience in a gym so for my lifting I would alternate between upper body/ lower body and do 4 sets of 8 on 5 different machines/ exercises. 

After the summer I went back to school and stopped working out and watching what I ate and subsequently gained back 10-15 pounds. The next summer came and I once again committed to getting back into the gym and losing some more weight. Although I did manage to lose the weight I gained, my eating habits were all over the place and I stayed around 195-200 pounds. 

Fast forward to March 2020 and COVID hits. I move back in with my parents to save some money and pick up running because gyms are all closed and I have unlimited free time essentially. I ran my first 10k in July and then my first half-marathon in September!! This time around I'm not doing any lifting though. At this point I'm steadily losing weight from running and IF 16:8 and managed to get down to around 170 pounds. Then about a month after my half-marathon I pulled a muscle and was off for a few months, subsequently gaining back 15 pounds. 

I picked up running again in December, and now am at the point where I'm lifting 5 days a week and running 25 miles a week. I still would like to lose some more weight, and get somewhere between 160-165. Once I get there I can switch my focus to lifting more, eating in a surplus, and putting on some muscle! 

The biggest thing I've learned throughout all of this is that weight loss is not always a linear progression. There are lots of bumps in the road, but the most important thing is that you pick yourself up and get back on the wagon! My quality of life has improved so much. I can do everyday activities without getting tired! Also, at least for me, obsessing over calories has never worked. I never know exactly how many I'm consuming, but I have a good estimate in my head. It just made things easier that way!"
"Just a quick rant - I did it on my own! A little bit of backstory: I've been gaining and losing the same twenty lbs for about the last 7 years, basically since my first kid was born. 

This past November, I found myself once again at 165. I decided to make a change - a real change. I don't eat breakfast, eat basically chicken, rice and veggies for lunch and dinner, no snacks, drinking nothing but 2 cups of black coffee in the morning and water throughout the day. I only have a couple seltzers for alcohol on the weekends. I mostly stick to it, and have been with the exceptions of holidays, one weekend day, and special occasions. I've lost just over 25 lbs in around 4 months, slow and steady. I don't track my calories as strictly anymore, because I've been doing it long enough I can kind of just tell since I eat the same thing every day. 

In mid January, I was officially diagnosed with adhd, and got put on adderall. It's basically changed my life (just being able to DO things is amazing) and I have been doing better at my work and keeping up on house things. All and all, things are going awesome right now, and I will probably hit my goal weight in another 3 weeks to a month!

I stopped by my parents to say hi, and mentioned how excited I am - not only did I blow past 145 (my nemesis weight I haven't been able to get past) I am officially in the 130's, which I don't think I've seen since my freshman year of college.

My Mom says something along the lines of ""well of course you're able to lose weight, it's a side effect of adderall!""

Like, what? I had already lost 20 lbs by the time I started it! I've only been on it for a little over a month! And I don't even take it on weekends! 

I just felt totally invalidated for a minute. But then I remembered I've lost 25 lbs, so whatever."
"I need to change Hi everyone,

Been a member of this sub for a while, I love reading stories of how far people have come on their weight loss journeys, every time I read them I think I really need to try, but after a few days I lose the motivation.

I’m 26 about 5”9 weighing in at 330lbs. I know, it’s really not good. I’ve struggled with my weight my entire life, in school I topped 16st but managed to lose it by basically hardly ever eating and exercising a lot, my motivation at the time was I was fed up of being bullied. 

This is the biggest I have ever been, and I know it’s only a small amount of time now before I end up with a serious health condition (diabetes) because of it. 
A few years ago I tried keto, and was doing really well and then got pregnant, I had heard that losing weight during pregnancy wasn’t good so I went back on carbs. I still ended up losing weight during pregnancy, bad morning sickness. 
Once I had my little girl in May 2019 I’ve just piled on the lbs, then all these lockdowns too I’ve been working from home and hardly exercising at all. 

I cannot stand the way I look now, and I know that even once I’ve lost all the weight I will have so much excess skin. I’m scared of how big I am, and scared of how gross I’ll still look when all the weight is gone. 

I need to do this, I kept promising I would when I had my baby, and I just never properly tried. I don’t want her to ever end up like me, or even motherless when I eat myself into an early grave.
My size has been impacting my relationship for years, my partner is loyal and loving he would never intentionally upset me, but I know he is so worried for me. To try and motivate me to lose weight he said I need to get down to 17st before we can start trying again, I was annoyed at first, but I get why, he knows how much I want a big family and that it should motivate me to lose weight. It did at first, but then again I just stopped. I have no excuses really, I’m ashamed of myself, when I really think about it I often cry so I guess I try to just push it out of my mind. 

Any advice you can give me to stick with it is hugely appreciated. Thank you for reading."

"WHEN should you count your calories burnt? Ok so I have been doing good with weight loss in a steady if not boringly decent path with an average of 10 lbs a month (a lot of it is obviously from the first 2 months with easy weight + water weight) and so far I've followed all the rules, dont stress about what you eat too much, focus on how much over what you eat, etc.

The one thing I find weird is keeping when to count calories burned, you see as a small gig I clean houses and other areas, this is now a ""gig"" cause I work ONLY for 2 costumers, a gay couple who are very lovely and make you feel welcomed when cleaning. I clean both their house and their store which is a spa.

Usually it's a 3 person job for both of the places but we've had up to 5 people cleaning to shorten time, the thing is we usually only clean in 1 day either their house OR spa, rarely do we do both at the same time, so when we did both yesterday we obviously needed food, we went to mcdonalds and we loaded up with lunch, in the morning I already had a big breakfast, a 1000 calorie breakfast and it lasted me enough energy throughout the cleaning of the house but when we got to the spa at around 7 we NEEDED food, I got a small mcdonalds ice cream, a big Mac and fries, I know that FOR SURE is somewhere in the 1000-2000 calorie count but ya know, things HAPPEN. I didn't worry much knowing I could just cico those calories later on, a small bump on the long road.

But the question is SHOULD I count the calories burned during the cleaning? As you heard I had practically burnt dry the 1000 calories by the end of the first part so SHOULD  I add it into count next time? And how would i?"
"Last week was bad. Advice please!? I'm down 3lbs in  the last 3 weeks. Im pretty happy with that as my weight loss goal is 10-15lbs but last week was rough in terms of sticking to my diet. My dietary goals were to cut out sugar, chips and fast food (except for once a week) and even then a modest meal from McDonalds or Wendys. I've lost weight before, rather easily, but that was prior to living with my current partner who always has sugary snacks around which I've grown to love myself.

I have been running, weight lifting and returning to intense boxing sessions which overjoys me and feels like the active life I used to have pre covid. I think I burned out last week. I missed a day of work and just sat at home resting and unfortunately binged on crackers and a few bowls of cereal. I felt great after having the rest (physically) but my mental fortitude was shot and I felt terrible about the previous days indulgences. Follow that up with going out for a late night smoothie two nights later, a night of poutine on the weekend and finishing off a good Sunday with more rice crispies than I can count.

I know I have to get back on the horse this week and feel motivated to do it but I know that my willpower will be pushed again once I start with my weekly activities. What are some tips for being able to keep my head on straight when I start feeling tired, exhausted, and bored while resting at home?"
"Effectiveness of cocoa butter/lotions during weight loss for skin elasticity? Hi all, I'm in my fifth week in to my weight loss journey, 8.4kg (18.6lbs) down currently, and I'm beginning to feel... I dunno, more ""pinchy"" in separate areas of my body. I dunno, it feels like it could all just be in my head at the moment, but my girlfriend has been hammering in that I need to start using things like cocoa butter, vitamin e, other lotions to help with loose skin down the road.

Now, I know the reality, I'm planning on losing over forty kilo's (88lbs) to start with and continue even more once I hit my current goal weight, I'm going to have some, if not a LOT of loose skin, and frankly, I'm okay with that. I'd rather look like Zoidberg with my shirt off than what I am currently, and I can look into surgeries from that point if it does affect me horribly, but I was wondering if at my age and current weight, that sort of skin treatment would have any noticeable effect along the way."

"advice to lose weight 
I(18f) started following a calorie deficit(1200cal) from mid December and within the first 6 weeks I was able to reduce 4 kgs without any exercise(didn’t have time cause exams) 

Now since the start of feb, I’ve been cycling 30-40 mins(300-400cal) for 4-5 days a week while eating 1200-1300cal and my weight has not dropped even one kilo in over a month 

My starting weight was 72kgs (159lbs), 
currently I am 68kgs (150lbs) and 
my goal weight is 58kgs (127lbs) to reach an healthy bmi for my height (156cm)

Also where I live all the gyms are close so that’s not an option, neither do I have much equipment at home 

Any advice?"
"Gaining lots belly fat out of nowhere Brief history, I eat well, ~1500 calories a day (100g protein; 196g carbs; 52g fat) while staying under 30g sugar. I exercise twice daily (running/gym), I smoke casually (maybe 3-4 per week) and might drink once or twice a week but I take that into account with my calorie intake

Since around the beginning of feb I’ve noticed I’ve gained a massive amount of belly fat seemingly from nowhere (no fat in the rest of my body) but I have a gut that is not proportional at all with my body and I have no clue why. I haven’t made any drastic changes to my diet and I do eat healthy foods (tuna/rice/chicken/veges almost exclusively) so I am having trouble understanding what’s going on

Can anyone shed some light on what’s causing this weird spike in belly fat or should I go to a doctor"
"I binged today I started my weight loss journey two weeks ago. this morning I was 5.6lbs down and then for reasons I don’t know I binged. I feel like all my progress is ruined. I don’t want to binge tomorrow. I want to leave today behind me and continue with my progress but I feel like I’m not strong enough to really commit to that.

I don’t even know why I binged. chips, chocolate, brownies, rice, chicken, cookies, tri-tips, cheese pizza. I had some of everything and I wasn’t even craving it. it was just there so I ate and ate and ate. I can’t even believe this is how much I used to eat regularly it’s almost sickening to realize. I’m gonna go to bed. tomorrow is a new day and I’m going to make it a good one."
"I LOST 60 POUNDS, BUT IN PAST TWO MONTHS I'VE GAIN BACK 10-15 POUNDS Ugh - over past two months or so, I gained back 10-15 pounds.  I got pulled away with a heavy time consuming project and fell into my old ways:  Eating too much, eating too frequently, and not engaging in the regular necessary exercise that got me to much of where I needed to be.  

I've been posting on here for nearly a year.  Here's the brief history:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/im1ave/45\_of\_100\_pound\_loss\_achieved/](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/im1ave/45_of_100_pound_loss_achieved/).  

So--anyone been through this yo-yo stuff when going for the 100 pound loss?  Any suggestions on how to recommit to it all?  

My short list would be: 

1. write/rewrite some concrete goals; 

2.get motivated again -- and try to develop real passion; 

3. plan meals and cook them (this seemed to be the largest different when I got this really going a few months ago);

3.1 - try to increase protein

3.2 - work to keep daily caloric content on mfp again

4. Get weight lifting really moving and going (weight cart basically finished tonight).

Happy to hear anyone's advice for v2!  thank you."
"Best way to utilize this sub I've been on the weight loss journey for what feels like my entire life. It is a struggle, something that causes me a lot of stress and anxiety. I'm bad at it. I mean, really. I know that if I weighed everything and really counted everything I ate, I would lose the weight, but I'm just not good at it. 

I'm currently 219.6 lbs as of this morning. I went down from 252 about 2 years ago. It's not much progress but it's something. 

Lately, I have felt really concerned that I can't go any further, that I just don't have what it takes to lose another 30 lbs. I've been around 220 for so long... So, I decided to make this post to ask for help. Its starting to really make me feel depressed to look at my stomach in the mirror. I'm not comfortable with my body at all.

How do I best utilize this sub? I usually just read posts and see people's successes. What else can I do to participate in this community in a way that actually leads to results?"
"Trying to gain muscle while dieting I’m 19F, 5’3 and I started dieting two weeks ago (eating 300-400cal per day), so far I’ve lost 13 pounds (went from 145 to 132) but now I want to start building muscle. My sister says when I workout I’ll need to start taking in more calories but I’m scared that if I do that I’ll just gain the weight back again before I build any actual muscle. I gain weight really fricking easily. 

I’m also concerned that I’m still a little bit too heavy on body fat to really get off the diet. 

Is 132 too much weight for someone 5’3? Should I start losing more weight before I start to work on building muscle? Is it safe for me to start building muscle while still on a (300-400 cal) diet?

Also I don’t know if this is really important but my full time job also keeps me a little active as well (running around/squatting and lifting heavy things (over 40lbs), etc..

Edit: so I see that the general consensus is that I’m not really doing this in a healthy way. I feel really dumb for unintentionally harming my body in the quest for weight loss/eventually building muscle but you guys’ comments are the wake up call I needed. I’m going to check out that fitness subreddit as well. Thank you guys!"
"Excel spreadsheet or app to track averages of weight/macros/calories?? With the help of this forum, mfp, and a nutrition plan I was given last year, I have managed to lose 8kgs and am now in the healthy weight range for my height (34, F, 181cm, 79kg/174pounds) yay!!

I lost it quite fast so I want to sllooowly lose the last 5kgs/12pounds before I start building muscle, so I'm wanting to up my cals.

I want to track this closely so that I'm not gaining fat again and I know alot of people serious about body building or collecting data on what works for them create spreadsheets to keep track of averages over days/weeks. 

I want to do this but have no idea where to start and how to create said spreadsheet! Does anybody have any templates/sample spreadsheets they use to show me?

Or, better yet, an app that will do this?"
"I am so proud of myself right now! Today I made an absolutely gorgeous macaroni and cheese to acknowledge a craving. I’m now sitting on the couch after enjoying a serving and I’m perfectly happy. I didn’t help myself to another fork-full (or 10), I’m not stuffed, I’m completely satisfied. In the past, I would have kept eating to the point of being uncomfortably full, or denied myself another serving, only to obsess over how I knew there was more on the stove. 

It’s so bizarre that this concept has me so proud of myself, but it’s proof to me that my relationship with food has changed so much, and for once its for the better.

We all want instant results, especially when it comes to weight loss, but the journey really is important to the course. I’m just a little over half way to my goal and this is validation to me that this process is meant to take time. We have to build and strengthen habits that make our weight loss goals achievable and maintainable. Losing weight is so much more than a physical change, and I’m loving this person I’m becoming.

Cheers to better health, better habits and this wonderful community!"
"30 Day Accountability Challenge - Day 7 Hello losers,

Happy Sunday. Anyone else meal prepping? What are you making? I've got a ground beef green chili going on.

Weigh in daily, enter in Libra &amp; report here even if I don’t like it: 230.4 this morning, 231.1 lbs trend weight.

Stay within calorie range (1800): Partner's birthday, maintenance. This first week was a bit of a wash on this front. 2/2 days.

Exercise 5 days a week: Gentle walk along a scenic over view path. Would like to have gone longer but it was sunshiny &amp; lovely. 7/7 days.

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, nonfood rewards): Started a really interesting book called ""The Only Good Indians"". Also finished another book this week. Keeps the wheels of my brain turning on productive things.

Try a new recipe once a week: Roasted romanesco &amp; sausage sammiches with grilled veggies. New sausage cooking method &amp; new types of sautéed veggies, new cooking method &amp; sammich, I say it counts! 2/4 weeks.

Express mindfulness and or gratitude: Today I’m grateful for perspective. Introspection is the name of the game, especially in quarentimes. I have a lot to learn as a person. I am experiencing metaphorical growing pains associated with becoming a person that welcomes love &amp; human connection instead of choosing to hide from it. If it doesn't kill me, I'm doing good lols. I wish you all well on whatever journey you are on along with our lovely CICO health journeys. 

Your turn kids!"
"Feeling frozen with fear and anxiety in the middle of successful weight loss. Has anyone else experienced this? How do I get going again? I’ve been on this current weight loss journey since a few months before the pandemic. I maintained my loss last year while the gyms were shut down, and then restarted things a couple months ago. I was doing so well, and I managed to get below 200. That was such a huge goal for me and I was so excited about it! I felt so motivated to keep doing what I was doing - CICO, getting 10k steps per day, and weight training a few days a week.

I’ve been in a little bit of a funk for a few weeks, but have been able to push through fairly well. Then, last week, something completely unrelated to weight loss tanked a day I had set aside for self care. After that, I’ve been struggling hard. Last weekend I went over my maintenance calories by a little bit. I was so upset about it for a while but was able to pull it together, take it in stride, and told myself I would just do better the rest of the week. Well, for whatever reason, this week I just can’t seem to get it together.

The scale isn’t moving because I’m not meeting my calorie goals. A few of the days, I went over maintenance. I’m feeling VERY lackluster when I go to the gym, which is just not like me. I’ve been getting such bad anxiety that I’ve gone to the gym three times and haven’t been able to get out of my car. It’s getting easier to stay home and easier to not care about my deficit. I keep panicking that I’m already falling off the bandwagon and that I’ll never actually reach my goal. I realistically know that a bad week is totally normal. I just can’t shake it. I feel like such a failure. I basically maintained or had a small deficit this week. 

I can look at all of this logically and just see a rough week... but it feels like the beginning of the end. I’ve been trying to lose weight my entire life, and I always ended up failing. I’m just terrified of failing again - I have been feeling so confident since last year that I’m really going to meet my goals. This week I just doubt all of it, but I’m shooting myself in the foot by not going to the gym and not eating in a deficit.

I’m not sure what’s going on. Can anyone relate? Am I just crazy? Haha. Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer any advice."
"Wanna lose 80 pounds by the end of the year. Any tips? Hey y’all. As you may have seen by the title, I wanna lose 80 pounds by the end of the year, as I’m currently a few pounds below 250 and have been overweight for years. I’ve always wanted to lose weight, but every time I’ve tried it never worked out for me and I just gained the weight I lost right back and then some. I started working out again at the beginning of the year, and have started to decrease the amount I eat everyday. I’m trying to eat below 1300 kcal daily, and I think me working out will help as well. However, I know there’s so much more that goes into losing weight, and I’m wondering if y’all have any advice in terms of what else I can do. Thanks to those who answer.

Also, I’m on mobile, so sorry if the formatting is shitty."
"I'm at the end of my 100 pound weight loss journey and my excess skin is coming off soon! Here's some advice about the surgery to other big losers who might be contemplating it themselves. So the title says most of it anyway.  I'm a big loser like many people here  and about to get a tummy tuck/abdominoplasty.  I've done a lot of legwork with the process and wanted to share some of the pitfalls and successes I've had in terms of planning the surgery, finding a surgeon, costs/paying for surgery, and even how to determine if you should have the surgery (IMHO).

As a precursor, **know that you're actually ready.**  Are you at your goal weight or a healthy weight?  Has your weight been stable (i.e. 1-2 years min)?  Do you know what it is you want to accomplish with a tummy tuck?  Is what you're seeing actually loose skin or simply excess fat?  Does what you see bother you enough you'd want to undergo surgery to correct it? 

If you're still obese and considering getting the tummy tuck, please keep going until you reach a normal BMI.  You owe it to yourself and a tummy tuck is not going to reveal a magical body underneath.  IMO if you've lost enough weight to have loose skin, you 100% have the capacity to get to a truly healthy weight.  If you still find yourself binging or emotional eating despite being at a healthy weight - this was huge for me - you also need to ask yourself if it's the right time.  If your weight loss was less dramatic, is what you're seeing really loose skin?  A tummy tuck scar can be 8"" or around your hips.  Is it worth going under the knife for that?

So after that disclaimer, tips for surgery...

1. **Shop surgeons.**  I ended up getting 4 consults and paid $300 - $150 of which was non-refundable.  Absolutely glad I did it.  You pay a consult fee and it's applied to the surgery if you go with that surgeon; if not, you lose it.  Seeing 4 doctors let me know whose prices were in line and whose weren't - I'll get more to that soon.  Seeing 4 doctors also let know which tummy tuck to decide on (e.g. mini, standard, extended, body lift/belt lipectomy).  It's never bad to have a second opinion, if only to confirm.  And one of the doctors I was appalled by so...
2. **Plan.**  Taking medical leave through work, applying for Short Term Disability (if applicable), arranging for a caretaker, medical followups - all take a lot of time.  Your back-to-work time might be anywhere from 2-8 weeks depending on your procedure.  If you're only getting loose skin removed (panniculectomy) with liposuction (included in the procedure cost), you're looking at a few weeks recovery - this is for all the big losers.  If you're getting abdominal muscle repair, you'll be out much longer - this is primarily women from childbirth.  You'll need a caretaker for your first week or two.  Meal prep is a good thing.  
3. **Consider all the costs and how you'll pay.**  I'm in the U.S. and my procedure is being performed domestically.  My 4 quotes in a major Northeastern city as of late 2020 average slightly under $11k for abdominoplasty without muscle repair in a surgical center.  Doctors' offices will frequently give you the option of having the procedure in a surgery center or a hospital.  Regardless of the decision, the procedure is outpatient and lasts about 3-4 hours.  A surgery center will cost anywhere from $1k-$2k less than the hospital. Abdominoplasty with muscle repair will cost more.  Insurance will not cover your procedure.  You realistically cannot obtain pre-authorization before your surgery either, unless you want to fight for it years ahead of time.  Insurance will only cover panniculectomies (loose skin removal) in cases of EXTREME weight loss that include skin irritations leading to chronic infection.  Quality of life considerations do not come into play.  Most plastic surgeon's offices are not set up for medical insurance billing and will tell you upfront they will help you with whatever documentation you'll need, but that the fight is yours.   


The  biggest expense besides the surgery is lost pay.  I'm fortunate in that my Short Term Disability policy covers all elective surgeries.  Most seem like they don't, but it doesn't hurt to inquire.  STD pays a fraction of your average wage after you've been out of work for a certain amount of days (the benefit doesn't start immediately).  

**I hope this next part helps people, because it's shaved thousands of dollars off my total costs had I not done otherwise.  (I didn't invent capitalism.)**

I recognize that this piece won't help everyone.  The surgery itself is obviously a stretch purchase for the vast majority of folks.  Here's what I'd recommend if your situation is similar to mine.

I saved for the entire procedure (including lost pay) and was going to pay in cash, but I'm paying with credit cards instead.  If you have good credit and can afford the surgery outright, consider doing the same.  Don't get 0% financing or financing through the doctor's office.  This has helped me shave about $3k from my total bill.  

Credit card sign up offers are golden.  You might get an offer that reads, ""Spend $1,000 in the first month, get $200 cashback!"" or something similar.  They're all the same; spend money X in 90 days and get reward Y.

I put all of my regular expenses on credit cards anyway - easier to track, I get rewards, better purchase protection.  I spend $2k a month on average.  But to be clear, I pay everything in full each month, so I carry no balance.  So if you're planning a $11k surgery and have credit card expenses of $2k per month like me, you're looking at $17k in 90 days.  How many credit cards can I sign up for then?  I got 6 with an 800 credit score, but in theory anything about 750 should be fine.  With all my bonus offers, minus a few with annual fees, I netted a little under $2,000.  

Running multiple credit cards is going to result in multiple hard inquiries.  This typically hurts people's credit.  I did NOT hurt mine.  This is why:

Credit score formulas are complicated and opaque, but basically you're judged off of different metrics with different degrees of importance.  Paying on time is by far number one with something like number of accounts coming in last.  Another key aspect is your utilization ratio.  Basically, the less of your available credit you use (outstanding amounts/all credit card spending limits), the better your score.  Even with 6 hard inquiries on my credit, my score did not go down.  The credit limits on my new cards caused my utilization to plummet, offsetting the dip from the inquiries (evidently).  YMMV.  

I did all the applications online in rapid fire and got instant approvals.  This part helps A LOT.  I link all my bills through PayPal.  Pay for your recurring bills through PayPal and set up a new card as the default.  Pay for all your physical purchases on this card until you hit the minimum spend amount and then pay off the card entirely.  Repeat this process for the next card and the next until your surgery.  Once your surgery fees are due - typically two weeks prior to surgery - ask the surgeon to split the cost among your remaining cards that still need to hit the minimum to receive the bonus.  With proper planning and financials, you shouldn't have to pay a dime in interest.

For me, STD benefits are direct deposit and eligible for new account bonuses in the same way credit cards are, ""Make X amount in direct deposits in 90 days and receive reward Y!"".  The online portal that administers my benefits is insanely easy with direct deposit, I can actually set up multiple accounts with defined contributions per week.  So I opened up 5 checking accounts with a $200 average bonus for $500 direct deposits in 90 days (or $2,500 in 90 days for all 5 total).  $100 per week from STD benefits into each account will cover me after 5 weeks, for an additional bonus of $1,000.  

Total ""savings"" of $3k.  The pitfalls to watch out for are making sure you aren't paying monthly fees on the checking accounts or annual fees on the credit cards.  Also, pay your entire statement off.  If you were gonna pay upfront, you already have the money.  

Tangent:  I've learned a lot about credit cards and checking accounts too.  They're definitely not all created equal.  If you find a financial product you like, stick with it and don't just cancel once you've gotten your intro bonus.  Similarly, don't hold onto a bad product; you tried it and it didn't work out.  Don't feel bad, it's competition among banks looking for your money.

Good luck, losers."
"I finally figured out how to keep my head in the game Male, 5'10"", started at 200, currently 181, goal 165. 

Hello! I just wanted to share my experience to see if it might be helpful to anyone here! I've always had a hard time convincing myself to stay on diet or exercise plans because even as I put on 40 extra pounds, with my height and build it hides itself pretty well. I was feeling the extra pounds though, and I've wanted to get back to where I was before my poor food choices in college got me where I have been the last few years. 

It was a cycle I'm sure we're all familiar with, start, go strong, get distracted or discouraged and lose all the progress. Then do it again a in month or so.

But recently I decided to start over, and I decided to take it one thing at a time. Start with only a focus on calories in vs out and make sure I'm staying in a deficit. So here's where the mind game started. 

Last time I tried, I set a small deficit goal and I had a hard time keeping it. I would either severely undershoot it and starve and then I would bounce back and overshoot the next day and so I wasn't making any sort of consistent progress and I gave up before too long. 

But this time, I outsmarted myself. I set a deficit goal of 1000 calories a day, which is massive for me, knowing it would be tough to keep, but setting such an intense goal for myself allows me to push myself towards that big goal, but even if I miss it or have a day that I feel like I need more, I still wind up with an average of 300-500 deficit a day, sometimes more. It lets the part of my brain who wants to get away with eating more than my goal get what it wants, while letting the rational part of my brain still accept that progress is being made because I'm still in deficit and losing weight. 

It works for me because it includes my tendency to cheat on my diet into my plans and ""outsmarts"" myself. 

I don't know if that would be helpful for anyone else, but I've managed to drop nearly 10 pounds in the last month or so and I'm happy with the progress!

Keep up the good work everyone! Go team!"

"Headaches with elimination diets? I just started doing the slow carb diet from tim Ferris’s book the 4 hour body.
My hemoglobin A1C is high and I wanted to try a lower carb approach to see if I could stabilize my blood sugar and energy throughout the day.
I’ve had some success with Noom but never liked weight watchers. And before I’ve gone from my current 220 to 190 with low carb.

How do you guys get over the hump of adjusting to a new diet, whether it’s an elimination type diet or lower carb?

I feel like I literally can’t handle how hungry I get or deprived I feel, and sometimes I feel so activated when I’m hungry or get these painful headaches that I feel behind my eyeballs.

Any words of wisdom on dieting adjustments? It gets very discouraging."
"Is there an app that recommends meals based on your macro goals/what remains of your daily macro goals? Hi all! I’m wondering if anyone knows of a site/app/service that suggests meals based on the macros you still need for the day. Maybe My Fitness Pal has it and I haven’t found it, but I keep thinking about how convenient it would be when I’m logging my meals. 

So if I logged most of the day and at 5 PM I still needed 20 of protein and 10 g of carbs, is there anything out there that can suggest things for me to eat that will help me meet my daily goals? 

I’ve been doing a lot of guess-and-check type logging, like adding in 1 tbs of peanut butter and seeing what it does to my totals, that kind of thing, but a service like this would be perfect, and I’m hoping it exists! 

Otherwise, how do you make sure you’re meeting your macro goals? All advice welcome!"
"Lost around 200 pounds. What piece of home equipment to tone now? I lost around 200 pounds on the keto diet. Now that I am near my goal weight I am trying to put on some muscle to tone my body. I am also trying to get bigger muscles on arms. I have started doing arm workouts one day then legs and abs workouts the next day then repeat so every day is either arms or legs and abs. I am now thinking about getting a piece of exercise equipment since I do not get out to exercise much.

I was thinking about an elliptical machine. Would that help much since I do not really need to lose much weight now and I want to be healthy and tone my body? Which piece of reasonably priced equipment would you recommend? I am also looking at a situp bench. Would adding in interval training on the elliptical be a good idea for my goals or what would you recommend. Thanks!"
"Regarding ""cheat days"" Hey all, so I'm F23 (173m/5'8'', SW 100kg/220lbs -  CW 68kg/150lbs - GW 60kg/132lbs). As you can see I've lost quite a huge amount (yay!) since October last year thanks to CICO (strictly no sugar, low carb), IF, walking and 2l of water every day.

I've had only 4 cheat days in the entirety of my ""journey"" so far, on occasions I couldn't avoid eating like NYE, my birthday etc. Cheat days for me were never a regular thing, because I found them distracting and I honestly couldn't trust my self-control since I'm a huge foodie. However since I've reached my first goal weight (70kg/154lbs), I've been considering having a cheat day/meal once in a while to satisfy my cravings. You see I've gotten so far, and now I'm a little bit tired :p 

My life's situation is a little bit physically/mentally draining for me at the moment, and knowing my tendency to emotional eat I want to add some moderate cheat days so my cravings don't pile up and explode one day haha. I have a few questions: 

- How often do you have a cheat day? Is it an entire day or just one meal? 
- People who do IF, do you break your fast on your cheat days?  
- Do you have a caloric limit for your cheat meal/day? Do you go past your maintenance? 
- To fellow binge eaters: How do you control yourself so you don't binge on cheat days? 
- How has having a cheat meal/day been affecting your weight loss journey so far? Is there any noticeable mental/physical effect? 

Thank you in advance! 

(I honestly don't like using the word ""cheat"" because it makes it sound like I'm sinning and should feel guilty over it, but for now let's just let that slide :p)"
"Gaining weight. Don't know why.  (F/29/5'1; starting weight; 128; current weight: 115 lb; current body fat %: 22.7; goal weight: 109 lb; goal body fat %: 19.0)

I have been on a weight loss journey since Sept 2020. I have reached my goal weight in December, but I was able to easily gain the weight back little by little.

**Here is my activity level:**

* I work in a desk for 6 hrs a day.
* After work, I take a walk for about 1.5 hrs- trying to at least get 11,000 steps a day. I try to do this everyday except for when there's a bad weather.
* After walk, I always do some kind of resistance training plus HIIT. I do this 5 days out of the week.

I mildly started resistance training about a month ago, but about a week ago, I completely overhauled my workout schedule alternating the days with leg, glutes, upper body.

**My diet:**

I first started with 1200 calories per day then reduced to 1100 a day, and this allowed me to reach 109. When I started to gain more weight, I went back to 1100, but it wasn't sustainable anymore (crazy hunger, and weak performance while working out).

* Now I eat about 1280 calories which is still in a deficit, but I'm gaining weight/fat. My clothes are starting to get tighter especially around my armpit area, but my belly is still on the slim side.
* I try to keep my macros to this ratio: 4 (carbs128g): 3(protein 96g): 3(fat 43g).
* I used to have cheat days once a week, but now I don't even do this anymore.
* I don't eat a lot of processed foods. I eat nuts, yogurt, berries, rice cakes, and two Bouchard dark chocolates as snacks.
* I drink one glass of green tea a day, and at least 2L of water a day.

**My overall goal:**

I'm not just solely looking for my weight to go down. I'm working towards to see more muscle definition, but I have excess fat especially around my upper back and lower belly right under the belly button. I am just so confused as to why I am gaining fat rather than losing... Any advice?

Thank you!"
"Multiple NSV wins/reasons to motivate yourself! 34F 164cm 64kg Hi all!

I know that many of you look for motivation so here is a list of reasons, from my personal wins, beyond the scale:

\- So I have a super flat face and I noticed esp in photos it would look so weird. Photos are all about the angles and I had none. Furthermore, my eyelids were thin and crepey, my skin was soft and sagging, and my cheeks looked heavy. Turns out, having enough electrolytes, water and minimal sugar, carbs and dairy, gives your facial skin wayyyyy more bounce. I specify facial skin because it \*is\* very different to body skin. Since my bone structure is so flat, now I'm even more keen to see how it will look once I've lost a fuckton of fat. 

\- My body skin! Listen, I'll be open and honest and say I already started with flawless Asian skin, and being a skincare addict, I have worked on that for yearsssss. Nevertheless, I was delighted to see further improvement, that my pores are tighter, my skin is smoother, the texture is creamier

\- My long-standing interest in skincare was really about chemistry: how does Chemical X result in Improvement Y on your skin? So when I started the health kick, I was mostly interested in the nutrition. I found motivation in the science, which is great cos I wasn't just counting the scales, which honestly hasn't moved much over 1 month. Finding an interest in this has been a win cos 1. it's interesting lol and 2. helps keep me on the wagon 

\- My gut health has improved: ah its kinda gross how I know this, but basically stools lol. Also, I just \*feel\* better in my gut. This is highly important to me because I think the gut is possibly the most important part of my health and I like to keep my microbes happy. 

\- My ass is firmer 

\- I eat for nutrition, not just calories. Calories are absolutely not all the same, and I am still trying to replace my godforsaken packet chips (have reduced tho). Food that has enzymes, nutrients, fatty acids, antioxidants, are going to beat ones that don't 

\- I am making my limited budget go further, with less 

\- My apartment smells nice, because it smells like fresh food 

\- I make small, but sustainable, improvements. I post in the Daily Victories thread almost every single day. I like making a change and tracking it's impact on me, so that I know if it benefits me, which motivates me. And if it doesn't work for me eg nuts for reasons, then I can go okay now I know. Either way, it allows me to see the real time impact rather than waiting for the scales, and helps prevent fatigue 

\-  I balance eating for fuel and pleasure. Fresh fruit and skinny cream are one of the favourite things in the world. 

\- I get value from making better choices for my exercise, diet, and wallet. Knowing that it's a better decision gives me the immediate feedback that gives me that dopamine hit everyone wants! 

Hope this resonates with some of you, keep posting all your highs and lows and seeking out a healthy and fit you :)"
"Gained a ton from depression eating and heavy drinking in the fall but have lost ~2/3 of the weight in two months! I’m posting here because my friends don’t really care that much/encourage me but I (21F) have lost 18 lbs since Dec 31st! I was extremely depressed in the fall (have struggled with it on and off for years) and as a result I was drinking heavily, working out less, and eating whatever I wanted. As a result of that I gained nearly 30 lbs from spring to fall of 2020, and I’m really proud of the steps I’ve taken to get healthy. 

I finally found a med combination that’s improved my depression considerably (also depresses appetite, which helps a bit with the weight loss) and since it’s started working I’ve found the motivation to work out more often and cut my drinking down significantly, which I consider a huge win because I’m in college and go to a HUGE party school. Drinking and drunk eating was my biggest problem, but I’ve also decreased portion sizes since I started this. I’m not sure what the form is for listing stats here, but here’s my journey so far:

5’6” 21F SW: 187.7 lbs CW: 169.2 lbs GW: Under 160 (155 would be ideal) 

I still have a bit to lose but it looks like I should be where I want to be in another two months! My fitness has greatly improved- I’m running a LOT faster and having better workouts, and my old clothes are fitting again, though I still don’t want to go shopping anytime soon 😅 I’ve always had a “bigger” or “thicker” build, but I realized that having that much weight just wasn’t healthy and I’m so glad I’m on this journey. I appreciate everyone here and kudos to you for taking steps towards a healthier life! It’s not easy, but we’ve got this!"
"26M - Long term weight loss struggle - looking for advice Hi everyone! I'm a 26 year old male, measure about 5' 7.5"", and weigh in at 146.4 lbs. 

I've always struggled with my weight. Growing up, i was always chubby. To rectify that, i joined swim teams but didn't see a meaningful change - probably bc of my diet (i love pizza and everything carby). Things changed when i got a personal trainer who introduced me to weight lifting and told me to cut all the crap out.

Fast forward to today, i work a desk job (get like 5-6hrs/night of sleep on avg) and have quite a sedentary lifestyle. The only exercise i get is through the few times i go to the gym. Before the start of the year i didn't really track calories or watch my macros.

I've recently decided that it's the perfect time for me to ""lean"" up bc of COVID and all the time home. Also, my friends want to do a week trip to Hawaii, which is the main impetus for my recent drive. I've been counting my calories and actively trying to increase my protein intake. I avg about 90-100g of protein, 160-200g of carbs, and 15-20g of fat. Calorie goal of ~1,700 calculated by MyFitnessPal. I'm vegetarian (no meat, no fish, no egg) by religion so protein intake is always a challenge and my diet skews heavier to carbs (legumes, fruits, like everything else).

Despite my efforts (both now and historically), I'd say my body look is more like skinny fat. All my fat is stored in my gut (and some back fat); my legs are very lean looking. Not sure if it's because of a weak core but my stomach is ALWAYS hanging out. I only ""look"" skinny/fit when i flex my core and my stomach sort of pulls in. I'd say there is some noticable muscle definition in the arms area. Can't see my abs or anything really. I tell my friends i need to lose weight and they look at me like I'm crazy.

I've used those body scales that tell you your body fat %. Research seems to indicate they're not accurate at all? They usually give me a range of 16%-17%. Using the ""eye test"", I'd say 20% bc of my gut area sticking out but i know I should be somewhere in between there, give how skinny i look elsewhere (at least to me). 

My goal is to get leaner/burn this fat off while hopefully building some muscle definition (hopefully by the summer or at least make meaningful progress), but I'm not sure how to do that. It's like a dream of mine to have that summer beach body (if i flex my core i can for sure feel the muscle definition underneath; it's just buried under the top layer of fat). I lift chest/shoulder/bicep when i go. I know i should have a balance and do triceps/back/legs/abs. I'm wondering if any of you have any advice for me? I'm not sure if i need to be lifting more often, more variety in terms of body parts I'm hitting, more weight/stress on the body, incorporate cardio? (Which is non existent right now), cut even more calories?, Etc. 

I would appreciate any advice/guidance/tips!"
"I Binged Last Night I've been doing really well lately, eating correct portion sizes and exercising. Overall I've lost 54 pounds which was not easy. Then last night, I suddenly felt out of control. I ate so much to the point where I threw up for the first time from a binge. I guess my body isnt used to how much I took in anymore. In the past I would feel so much shame the day after a binge and continue to do it for several more days. This morning I walked a few miles, made a nice healthy breakfast, and told myself today is a new day and it is my choice. I'm proud of myself and I had no one to share this with so here it is. Thanks to this community, it's been beyond helpful to keep me going."
"Face gainz are a thing So at the height of depression and such (had moved to a new state for a new job, hadn't seen my family in three months since needed to have a house first) I managed to eat my way to 327 pounds. Heaviest I've ever been in my life. Decided it was time to change, started doing intermittent fasting and keto (and actually COOKING). Have coupled that with walking at a brisk pace (fast enough to be movin', slow enough that I can carry a conversation). That's it. This morning, I'm down sixty pounds, to 267. It's a good feeling, not going to lie. Smaller numbers feel great in this game. The thing that REALLY got me feeling good was on Friday. A coworker commented ""Wow No-Tongue_the_Pirate, you made some good face gains!"" It'd been about three months since we'd last seen one another in person. Was a nice feeling.

So yeah, wanted to share that. Obligatory pictures of the difference https://imgur.com/a/1fdTwH4 . I'm excited to see what losing another sixty pounds is going to look like.

Edit: To answer folks, and I answered below, it was five months between the pictures (started in October) and I eat 1750 calories a day."
"Healthy advice for sustainable weight loss Hi all, 

I am a 5'7"" female who has always struggled with weight. For reference, I was 5'3"" and weighed 135 lbs when I was 10. In high school I held the same weight all throughout, at roughly 185 lbs. I've gained a lot of weight over the pandemic and I'm at my wit's end trying to lose it. 

My biggest limiting factor with dieting is that I have Celiac disease, so I have to be 100 percent gluten free. I've been doing some workout videos at home, and my usual go-tos are dance workouts and low-impact cardio because I don't have any equipment or a gym membership. I lost about 15 lbs when I first went gluten free 2 years ago, but I've gained it all back and then some in the past 18 months. 

I don't want to do any fad diets. I tried intermittent fasting for a few weeks and hated it because I felt so obsessive over clocking my eating time that it really overtook my life. (I also didn't feel like I saw any results from it--I felt worse, not better.) I'm also not down for spending a lot of money on supplements, sugar replacements, or expensive luxury items like coconut aminos.

Sorry for the limitations. I really do want to lose weight. I just want to make it a lifestyle change and not a fad diet thing. Any advice or support would help a lot! Thanks!"

"Stuck in a cycle of being depressed, so I'm not eating well, so I'm putting on weight, so I'm getting more depressed. Want to break cycle - any tips? Hi /r/loseit,

24yo male, 5ft 11 and probably about 110kg (I can't face getting back on the scales). I've been trying to lose weight for god knows how long at this point, I always seem to do well for a bit, and then lose all motivation and just stop.

Recently, life's been going less than optimally, shall we say, and I've been absolutely destroying my body with the amount of unhealthy food because I'm failing to find the energy to cook, which is less than optimal.

Does anyone have any tips and/or recipies I can use to get myself out of this slump and start looking after my body better?

"i am actually losing weight for the first time in my life and i don’t know how to deal with it but i am so happy hi! so i‘m a 20 year old girl and ever since i got into middle school i wanted to look like a stereotypical supermodel (silly, i know). 
i went to a school that focused on dance, ballet in particular, and as any of you who did ballet will know that the bullying and toxicity in that environment is brutal. 
i used to constantly get bullied and excluded for being weird and fat (even though i was never more than 5kg overweight) so because of that and some other messed up reasons i naturally developed an ed and have been struggling with that over the past eight years. 
i went vegan for ethical reasons at 16 which made me lose those 5 extra kilos and ever since then i‘ve been losing and gaining the same 3-4kg in the healthy weight range but it’s never been substantial. 

after years of therapy and learning to love myself it somehow clicked this year. i don’t look at myself in the mirror with disgust anymore, i don’t hate my body, i don’t see food as a reward or punishment anymore and exercise is something that just makes sense for some reason.
i’m now at the lowest weight i’ve ever been with my height (181cm/73kg) and i just keep on losing. i feel like it could actually be possible for me to achieve that “supermodel body” and it kinda scares me. i don’t think that i need that body type to be happy or beautiful anymore, i already am happy and beautiful. however i still want to look like that. (mainly just to see how that version of myself that i’ve dreamed of for years would actually look like ngl hahaha)

so why am i scared of that? is it the lose skin? no, it’ll just bounce back since i’m still young and i’m really not losing that much. 

is it that i’m scared i’ll become a bully myself? no, i have so much love in me and have forgiven all people who’ve wronged me in some way before so i don’t hold any anger anymore. plus i don’t think anyone should ever be bullied, especially not for their looks.

scared of losing my “safety blanket”? nope, don’t need that anymore. 
scared that i won’t be able to recognize myself? no, not that either.

i’ve thought through every single possible reason and the only conclusion i came to is that some little part of me still believes that i don’t deserve to look like i want to look. and that’s okay. today i will choose to be kind to that part, to be kind to myself because i deserve everything i’ve ever dreamed of. i am not worthless and neither are you. 

this was just me rambling for a bit and i know this post doesn’t really offer much advice but i hope that some of you can take something away from it. 

weight loss is such a hard journey and it can put you through absolute hell mentally and emotionally, no matter how much or little you want to lose. you are so incredibly strong for even just being here and i believe in you. you are amazing, incredible and beautiful. 
i truly hope you can choose to be kind to yourself for today as well, because you truly deserve it. you deserve the world! 


sorry for formatting i’m on my phone and i really don’t like capitalized letters lol"
"Just starting my journey and in need of some guidance. I am eager to get going but I need to know that I am doing this right and doing it the healthy way! SW: 235 GW: 140 Hi!  A little background about me, very brief but helpful... 35, 5'2, female, moderate ""exercise"" (SAHM of a 4 yr old and 10m old).

After having my son I started gaining weight like crazy. When I had my son 10m ago I was 180 and now I'm 235. It's gotten to the point where I needed to see my doc to get some advice, and I did this past Friday. She suggested I download and use the Lose It app and stick to a calorie goal of 1400 in order to lose about 1-2 lbs a week, then after 10 weeks I can lower my goal to 1200 and stick to that to manage and maintain my loss. She also wants me to stick to a what she called ""vegetarian lite"", lessen my red meat intake, eat veggies high in iron, fiber, and protein. No white foods like white rice, potatoes, white bread (I only eat wheat anyways), sugars. Skip unnecessary sauces like gravy, condiments, and cautiously watch my sodium intake. While this seemed like a lot to me, in the last couple days since our meeting I've been watching what I'm eating and how much of it I am consuming. I thought I was eating well throughout the day, but I've found that I'm only eating my kids leftovers and then binge eating when everyone goes to bed. I'd eat a bowl of cereal, nachos, brownies, all sorts of crap that I was wanting to eat in the day but instead of just saying no to it altogether I justified it with ""well, you busted your ass today with the kids, enjoy what you want!"". Bleh. I felt gross, I knew it was a bad idea but I did it anyway. I digress...

 I want to stick to my docs suggestions, and I have every intention to do what she says. I am subbed to 
r/CICO and while the idea seems straight forward, I still don't get it (which makes me feel stupid and discouraged). My app/doc says 1400 cals, today I only ate 1282, so I have eaten less than what they suggested. Is that good? Am I doing this right? My TDEE calculator says I should be eating 2459 which sounds like way too much. For someone that doesn't work out very much it just sounds like way too many for me and my lifestyle. I'm sure my Lose It app took a deficit into account and projected a 1400 intake to help reach my goal, which would make sense because that's what my doc said as well. Now, I am not good with math whatsoever... So what I'm understanding is this:

According to my data, my caloric intake should be 2459. BUT, I need a deficit to jump start my weight loss, so my doc/app projected a 1400 goal. Thus, my initial ""deficit"" is 1059. Is that right?? For some reason I STILL don't understand the process of CICO. I've posted to the sub and my question has some traction but I'm still not fully getting it... Idk if what I'm understanding is right, wrong, or half n half..."
"[study] A Tour Through Google Scholar's Studies On Weight Loss Methods  

I wanted to share the results of a long read through Google Scholar that I took. Hi [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/)!

**About me**

Like 3 years ago I went on Keto and it was awesome, helping me go down from like 215 pounds to 170. I could do like five consecutive pull-ups for the first time without much effort beyond mixing up Keto Chow shakes each evening! (I love those things.)  Co-workers commented on how great I looked! Cool.

Fast forward past a year of pretty easy maintenance, whereupon my doctor puts me on Zoloft, and I gained like twenty pounds back before ditching that for Bupropion, a much friendlier antidepressant that didn’t make me constantly ravenous. But try though I might, I had trouble getting back down to 170 with Keto-- I'm still hovering around 190.

This probably had something to do with the fact that I was living alone when I first lost the weight, and am now living with my fiancee and a number of roommates. Which makes sticking to Keto… substantially more difficult. “Hello I have prepared a delicious fruit pie”, a roommate will say, and I’ll unhinge my jaw and swallow it whole (like a python) thereby breaking ketosis. Which is a bummer.

I also have a couple of other roommates who themselves were having trouble losing weight, as was my fiancee even though she’s way more wonderful and industrious and conscientious than I am. And that inspired me to take a long, interest-fueled trip through Google Scholar, since it turns out that the efficacy of different methods of weight loss is *super* commonly-studied, and ours is a beautiful age where any internet asshole can search through unlimited carefully-indexed studies looking for incredibly specific nuggets of information. *And I am just such an asshole.*

**DISCLAIMER**

So, about me! I’m just a programmer, with no particular expertise in this or any other area. That means I am deeply unqualified to offer any kind of medical advice; my only qualification for doing anything is that I spent a bunch of time skimming online journal articles. So if you get inspired to try anything I talk about in this post, ask your doctor about it before you give it a shot or else you’ll die slowly, painfully, as your poor choices consume you from the inside out. And you will cry out ""why did you betray me, UntrustworthyBastard"" and I'll shrug and gesture at my username.

On to the studies! Let’s start out with

""Non-pharmacological weight loss methods"" are diet and exercise. This has been studied a lot, and these studies vary pretty dramatically in their results for reasons I'm not totally clear on. Probably they have a lot to do with how well the participants are made to adhere to the prescribed diet/exercise regimens.

Which is actually a core limitation of these studies! Most of these studies are intent-to-treat, which means they all include each participant in the study results *even if the participants don’t follow the diet or do anything differently.* Another way of phrasing this is that these studies measure the long-term efficacy of getting a bunch of people who want to lose weight into a room, and then telling them to go on a calorie deficit/keto diet/whatever (with accompanying pamphlets and sometimes logistical support, like buying them food), and then periodically hassling them afterward for the duration of the study.

Looked at in this light, it’s frankly impressive they were able to tease out any effect sizes at all. I would have liked a review article that broke the participants down into percentiles of weight loss-- that would give us a better idea of the range of outcomes realistically achievable-- but couldn’t find any meta-analyses that did this. Such is life.

**Diet + Exercise**

[Weight-Loss Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Weight-Loss Clinical Trials with a Minimum 1-Year Follow-Up - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002822307014836)

\&gt; *A mean weight loss of 5 to 8.5 kg (5% to 9%) was observed during the first 6 months from interventions involving a reduced-energy diet and/or weight-loss medications with weight plateaus at approximately 6 months. In studies extending to 48 months, a mean 3 to 6 kg (3% to 6%) of weight loss was maintained with none of the groups experiencing weight regain to baseline.* ***In contrast, advice-only and exercise-alone groups experienced minimal weight loss at any time point***.

[Systematic review of long-term weight loss studies in obese adults: clinical significance and applicability to clinical practice | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/0802982)

\&gt; *Dietary/lifestyle therapy provides &lt;5 kg weight loss after 2–4 y, pharmacologic therapy provides 5–10 kg weight loss after 1–2 y, and surgical therapy provides 25–75 kg weight loss after 2–4 y.*

This seems basically consistent with the previous study where over the long term diet and exercise-based interventions, for the most part, lead to 5-10 lbs of maintained weight loss.

[Very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet v. low-fat diet for long-term weight loss: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials | British Journal of Nutrition | Cambridge Core](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/verylowcarbohydrate-ketogenic-diet-v-lowfat-diet-for-longterm-weight-loss-a-metaanalysis-of-randomised-controlled-trials/6FD9F975BAFF1D46F84C8BA9CE860783)

\&gt; *\[L\]arge randomised clinical trials with long-term dietary interventions aiming weight loss showed that individuals under intensive lifestyle interventions lose about 4·8 kg( 2 , 38 ). Hence, the further reduction of 0·9 kg in the individuals assigned to a \[very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet\] would represent almost 20 % of the awaited weight loss achieved with long-term dietary interventions.*

So tl;dr: Non-calorie-restricted ketogenic diets work *marginally* better than low-fat calorie-restricted diets on average, but not by much-- Keto loses you like 12 pounds, and low-fat diets lose you like 10 pounds.

This is a larger effect size than we saw in earlier studies, which could be explainable by the study length cutoff here was 1 year whereas the earlier, more pessimistic study required like four years of followup to be included in the meta-analysis (leaving more time for weight regain).

What about exercise?

**Exercise**

[Isolated Aerobic Exercise and Weight Loss: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002934311003779)

\&gt; *Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise programs of 6-12 months induce a modest reduction in weight and waist circumference in overweight and obese populations. Our results show that isolated aerobic exercise is not an effective weight loss therapy in these patients. Isolated aerobic exercise provides modest benefits to blood pressure and lipid levels and may still be an effective weight loss therapy in conjunction with diets.*

This, you’ll notice, pretty much aligns with the [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) conventional wisdom on the topic: Exercise alone tends not to do it unless you're Michael Phelps, who my fiancée tells me eats multiple tubs of ice cream each day.

So far, so depressing-- everyone here knows that if you have the industriousness and conscientiousness to stay on a consistent calorie deficit, you’ll lose weight. It's just empirically this doesn't happen to the degree most of us would want. Though don’t forget the study limitations! Intent-to-treat is a harsh mistress, and the use of averages in these study results conceals a *lot* of individual variation in patient response to these diets.

Anyway, on to other, more exotic (but not *that* exotic) methods of weight loss!

# FDA-approved pharmacological interventions

Drugs!

This’ll be a pretty short list; the FDA has a very high bar for safety and efficacy for weight loss drugs, and as such has approved only 9 (?) drugs in this class for current usage, several of which are on-patent and thereby only affordable to the twelve riches members of the Saudi royal family. The FDA's conservative about approving these, since the history of weight loss medications includes shit like Fen-Phen (can kill you) and DNP (can make you go blind and *then* kill you; though at least this one was obvious enough that it was [banned by the FDA at around the same time the FDA got the authority to ban things](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/shilling-for-big-mitochondria).)

So the FDA makes *really fucking sure* these days that there's nothing waiting in the weeds before approving stuff for weight loss. Oftentimes this assurance comes from jamming together drugs with a long history of safe use for other conditions (see the discussion of Contrave below), which seems sensible enough.

As for whether you’d like to take drugs for weight loss, your call-- I know a lot of people on r/loseit take pride in losing weight the natural way, and more power to them. That said, the following is the opinion of the notoriously risk-averse FDA:

\&gt; [The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends pharmacotherapy for weight loss when lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise and behavioural therapy) have failed and the body mass index (BMI) is °30kg/m2 with no concomitant obesity-related risk factors, or if the BMI is °27 kg/m2 and the patient has at least one obesity-related risk factor.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

I'm aware that this does *not* align with the [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) conventional wisdom, which mostly has it that drugs are a dangerous crutch unsuitable for long-term use (and, by implication, short-term use). Which isn't always true! Lots of drugs you can basically stay on forever (such as bupropion, a popular antidepressant). The unknown risks of doing so ultimately must be weighed against the known risks inherent to obesity, which are substantial; in that way, it's a similar cost-benefit analysis as taking drugs for any other chronic condition. I myself will probably be on acid reflux medication until the day I die, and it's *super worth it*.

On that cheery note: to the drugs!

**Orlistat (Xenical)**

\&gt; [weight loss achieved was about 3% \[of total body mass\] greater for subjects taking orlistat than for those taking placebo.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

\&gt; [produces significant gastrointestinal side effects (oily faecal spotting, flatus with discharge, faecal urgency, oily stools, increased defecation, faecal incontinence, abdominal pain) in 15-30% of the patients under treatment, that tend to disappear with time if the patient adheres to a low fat diet.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991023/)

Gross.

This one’s notable because almost all of the other weight loss drugs on the market do so via the mechanism of reducing appetite; this one’s an exception, in that it instead stops your body from absorbing some of the fat you eat *whereupon it comes out the other side*.

Let’s move on.

**Phentermine+Topiramate (Qsymia)**

[Clinical utility of phentermine/topiramate (Qsymia™) combination for the treatment of obesity (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3626409/)

In this trial, about 8% of patients with placebo (diet + lifestyle counseling) lost &gt;10% of their body mass; conversely, 47% of patients in the experimental group (diet + lifestyle counseling + Qsymia) lost &gt;10% of their body mass. Note that 1% of people in the experimental group got kidney stones, so drink your water. It sounds like this is a consequence of the topiramate (at least, this appears to be a known side effect of topiramate taken alone.)

[Off-label drugs for weight management (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473499/) has a really interesting discussion of phentermine-- at the time it was approved it was under pretty serious regulatory scrutiny for its structural resemblance to meth (and thus presumed addictive potential); for this reason it was approved for short-term use only, which tends to be interpreted as up to 3 months. Post-approval studies, happily, have failed to find evidence for chemical or psychological dependence regardless of duration of use; the linked article claims:

\&gt; *There was protracted opposition to re-approval from those who maintained the sympathomimetic obesity drugs that had dangerous addiction potential. No evidence of addiction had appeared during 18 years of increasingly frequent use, but the FDA re-approved them all, having silenced the opposition by announcing the drugs would be approved for short-term use only*

\&gt; *US physicians treating obesity \[...\] continued to use phentermine and the other sympathomimetic amine anorectic drugs off-label long-term. Surveys of prescribing practices among physicians treating obesity have confirmed that a majority of these physicians continue to prescribe the sympathomimetics off-label in this manner.*

This is verified in a different study:

[Addiction potential of phentermine prescribed during long-term treatment of obesity | International Journal of Obesity (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo201374)

\&gt; *Phentermine abuse or psychological dependence (addiction) does not occur in patients treated with phentermine for obesity.*

And also:

[A Study of Abrupt Phentermine Cessation in Patients in a Wei... : American Journal of Therapeutics (lww.com)](https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/2011/07000/A_Study_of_Abrupt_Phentermine_Cessation_in.5.aspx)

\&gt; *Cravings for the substance abused, the hallmark characteristic of substance dependence and withdrawal, were entirely absent in the phentermine-treated subjects. Abrupt cessation of long-term phentermine therapy does not induce amphetamine-like withdrawal. Long-term phentermine therapy does not induce phentermine cravings. Symptoms observed after abrupt phentermine cessation represent loss of therapeutic effect and are not withdrawal.*

(I emphasize this part because the idea of getting addicted to something freaks me out.)

**Phentermine Alone**

[Effects of a meal replacement system alone or in combination with phentermine on weight loss and food cravings - Moldovan - 2016 - Obesity - Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21649)

*&gt; The phentermine group lost 12.1% of baseline body weight compared with 8.8% in the placebo group.*

**Naltrexone/bupropion (Contrave)**

[Contrave, a bupropion and naltrexone combination therapy for the potential treatment of obesity. - Abstract - Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19777400)

\&gt; *Preliminary data demonstrated placebo-subtracted weight losses of 3 to 7% and improvements in obesity-related comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary adverse effect leading to discontinuation of treatment was nausea.*

So a bit less effective than Qsymia based on phase 3 trials, but not by much; the bright side is it’s not a stimulant if you don't like stimulants. The “off-label drugs” article above claims this is sometimes combined with Phentermine but that there is no data on how often this happens or what the results are. Which is unsatisfying.

As an aside, bupropion is just Wellbutrin, an extremely common antidepressant, and naltrexone is an anti-addiction agent they use to get people off alcohol. Naltrexone’s been on the market for 15 years, and Bupropion has been on it since like the 80s. Which makes me suspect it’s quite safe, since we’ve had decades for long-term side effects to make themselves known. Food for thought. Ask your doctor.

(Speaking of long-term effects, very early on they were concerned that Contrave might hurt long-term cardiovascular health, which luckily wasn't observed in practice. Then later they thought it might actually *help* cardiovascular health instead, but [Orexigen fucked up the study](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/05/13/how_not_to_handle_your_clinical_data) so now we'll have to languish in ignorance forever, I guess?)

**Liraglutide (Saxenda)**

Apparently middling effectiveness. I’d paste some sources, but the post is getting long and this drug is like 1000 dollars a month. So maybe look into it if you *shit gold.* (I am, of course, joking-- shitting gold is a contraindication for Liraglutide and other GLP-1 inhibitors. Ask your doctor.)

I have a truly marvelous discussion of weight loss surgery that this margin is too narrow to contain."
"Lost 80lbs+ Last Year, Just To Gain It All &amp; More In 3 Months... New Journey Round 2 Hey guys, my name is Jeremy, 28yrs old, 6’2 &amp; Black. Last year I decided to go on a weight journey and to an extent, I found it very successful! I wasn’t sure the approach I should take so I ended up crash dieting (1000-1200 calorie intake) from 286lbs down to the low 190s, Starting March 2 2020 and ending June 24th 2020. 

With this I ended up finally seeing my abs, and really defined muscles. Once I hit the 190s abs had a skeleton type face I went on a body recomp. For the next few months I proceeded to work on becoming a body builder and transformed my body to my idea look. I was able to walk into stores without sucking it, I got complements from everyone saying I look jacked and everything you can think of.

After a while I started bingeing on and off and it was a horrible and tedious cycle of bingeing and working out for hours to attempt to feel better about it. Abs and bicep veins started to go away, then week after they would return. This cycle would soon ruin all my progress. 

As of November of 2020 I kept my weight around 240 and still had a bodybuilder physique and thought I could return to my old self....or so I thought. I all of a sudden went on a weeks/months long binges and stopped counting my calories, stopped cardio and working out thinking of only how easy I could lose it all. 

March 1st of 2021 I went on the scale and was 280lbs, no abs and no more protruding veins..What have I done, I’m at my all time highest weight. 

I’m now back on track and currently at 270.2lbs and haven’t binged yet. This will be a rough journey but I will get thought it once again and seeing everyone on this Reddit shall give me strength. 

From Fat to Shredded to Fat.... I will stop this cycle. 

I will provide pictures if anyone is interested!"
"losing weight as a teenage girl hi, im a 14 year old teenager, im 5ft and 135~ lbs, and ive been struggling with my weight over quarantine. at the beginning of quarantine i was 13 years old and around 119 lbs if i remember correctly. during summer, i gained weight and jumped up to 135 lbs and now im stuck at this weight. any advice on eating habits to lose weight? ive tried interment fasting and calorie deficit, but ive failed a lot of times. im trying to lose weight because its something i want to and need to change to better my self esteem and mental health. im also doing this to drop weight before i go any further above my bmi and possibly become overweight to prevent health issues. thank you in advance!"
"I feel so lost and confused I’m back up to my starting weight, the weight I was after I had a baby... 5 years ago. This weight loss journey has been a roller coaster. Up and down over and over and over. 

Two years ago I paid a lot of money to join a weight loss program and I lost all the weight. I was freaking at my goal! Then life happened. Things were really hard in my life, marriage, religion... everything and I’ve gained it all back. I’m almost up to 180. My goal weight is 145. I’m so so mad at myself for letting life get in the way and gaining it all back. 

I don’t have the money to do a weight loss program again. I do have the time to exercise at home and around my neighborhood and I do have the money to just eat healthy but it’s so hard to stick with it with young kids and just life in general. 

I need an exercise program I can stick to. 
I need a food plan i can do on my own and my family will enjoy it too. 

But I’m not sure exactly what I need to do. 
Where do I begin?"
"How do y’all usually estimate restaurant calories? Hi guys! Basically what the title says. I’m pretty far into my fitness journey but I still struggle with guessing restaurant food calories! If it’s not listed, I’m pretty much flapping in the wind. I know the helpful trick of comparing it to a similar restaurant (ie, local burger joint with nearly same-sized sandwiches as McDonald’s, whatever) but for some places I go to that’s not applicable. &amp; even my ‘best guess’ is doubtful, because for example, some places, a small milkshake is 500cal and at others, it’s 1,000cal, just depending on where you go. How do I know if I’m right?!?! Lol I don’t want to spend that much on a shake!!

So I guess I’m asking, what do you guys typically do? I’m not gonna agonize over it or anything (I only ask because I have a fun distanced picnic with friends tomorrow with takeout from a burger place!) but I just hate how there’s no way to tell for like, lil mom-&amp;-pop places. Thanks!"
"Does your metabolism slow down if you do too long of a severe calorie deficit over a long time? I have been reading on various diets and most people are telling me to do keto, but I've heard it isn't conducive for beginners who are instead recommended to do a CICO (calories in calories out) diet and have a caloric deficit of 500 calories per day, but the keto people are saying that running a caloric deficit for an extended period of weeks or months can cause long-term damage to lowering your metabolism level, causing you to feel sluggish and tired for several years after your diet is over.

I've also heard that keto is easier than counting calories, but I also don't want to give up carbs because I'm a vegan.

So my question is whether or not your metabolism slows down after long-term caloric deficits over an extended period of time?"
"Progress! Some happy news, and a question if anyone wants to answer. 

I went to the doctor’s office in the fall and was gobsmacked to learn I was over 150 lbs (I’m 5’2”). I honestly thought I’d been eating well in the pandemic since I was eating from home all the time and not buying from restaurants and food trucks every day like I used to. 

Anyways, the recent end to a 5 year relationship convinced me to give up the talenti for dinner. I bought a scale last weekend and when I weighed myself on Monday, 142! I was pleasantly surprised. Over the course of last week I got down to 136.2; I’ve consistently been 136.2 for the last 3 days in a row! I feel good about holding steady :)) 

I had been planning to not exercise much until I hit 126 (historically a good weight for me); but now I’m wondering if I need to start doing cardio to continue losing? 

I’ve been eating yogurt, avocado, Starbucks skinny macchiato (I love them...), juice, carrots, almonds, and banana chips this past week. I try to avoid meat in general."
"3 yes’s, 3 no’s Trying something new and so far it’s working quite nicely. Thought I’d share.  Based on my knowledge of myself and my habits, I came up with a list of 3 things I would do every day (my yes’s) and 3 things I wouldn’t do (my no’s).  

I already have a pretty healthy food intake and a decent exercise program, but wasn’t losing weight. My yes’s and no’s are helping me zone into those few habits that need improvement.  

If you try this, I’m sure your yes’s and no’s will be different, but here’s mine:
- yes, drink a large glass of water first thing in the morning
- yes, drink green juice (kale, cukes, etc) every day
- yes, walk around the block every day after work for stress relief
- no chocolate
- no sweets (cookies, cake, etc)
- no second helpings. 

So there ya go!  Enjoy."
"20 lbs lost and no reduction in breast size - is it too early to panic? Hey there! I (23F) have lost 20 lbs so far. The distribution has been more or less even, with the exception of my breasts. I started from US 34K. Now, the band is uncomfortably loose but the cups remain full. 

Just to address a few potential issues:
- They're staying pretty much the same in size throughout the cycle,
- I wouldn't say it's water retention - I've had no major issues with it so far,
- I probably have a lot of breast tissue (they were pretty big even as an underweight teen) but not that much I think - they were substantially smaller at a similar weight earlier. Never got it checked though,
- Pretty sure I got the start size right - I can't really get a good bra without a bra fitter's help,
- According to the theory that says you lose weight the fastest from places you gain the slowest, that could make sense. It's still weird that they haven't changed at all after 20 lbs,
- There's a 0% probability of me being pregnant; never been pregnant and never breastfed.

Is it any normal or already a reason to be concerned?"
"Wish me luck, I just began this journey again. Sorry, even though I tried it came out long.

33F, 167 cm (~5 ft 5 in), nearly 67kg (~147 lb / ~10.5 st). I had a child in June 2019 and I fared quite well with the weight during pregnancy and PP, I was trying to keep my weight stable. And abused the fact that I was exclusively breastfeeding (I still am and I still do).

Then, COVID and family situations happened (sister got cancer diagnosis and triggered the entire family). I stopped going to the gym a year ago, I let myself go since last September/October and my weight just kept on going up and up and up. 

While this is not the heaviest I've ever been, I don't like what I let happen to me again, since 4 years ago I was in the same predicament, and then 4 years prior, and before that I was a ""not so chubby but definitely not attractive"" teen / young adult who loved to eat my feelings away because I had nothing else to do. I've been anxious since I can remember and depressed since early teen years (maybe 12 - 13).

When I lost the most weight I managed to reach 56.5 kg ( 124.5 lb / 8.9 st) but I was insanely undereating, abusing coffee, diet coke, water and looked for pro-ana tips to not eat. So, while I did not become anorexic, I was trying really hard to count everything that went into my body to achieve my goal of finally ""not being fat"". 

Just before I got pregnant I was in the absolute best shape of my life. I was doing MMA for one hour a day, 4-5 days a week, trying to eat right and moderate my terrible sweet tooth and tendency to want to eat until I feel full; and, while I never went lower of 61 kg, I had muscles and I liked that. Granted, I never ever have had abs, but I was going to work towards that. 

Well, I am now faced with the decision of changing lifestyles. While I'm not obese (yet), being overweight is less than ideal. And since I have a child, I want to be a good example and also to be congruent with what I try to teach her to eat well and what not. Also, I want to be here a long time if possible to do my bit and then see her grow. But in the more immediate future, I'm thinking on baby #2. And given the fact that one shouldn't lose weight during pregnancy, I also worry about being healthy while pregnant. So my goal at the moment is my own health. I need to lose the weight to be able to gain it back while pregnant (so I don't gain more than necessary and not harm myself or baby with that much weight). I also shouldn't be this heavy as I've a ""broken"" disc in my back (congenital defect, was cartilage not bone and in the base of the back, so really shouldn't put on much weight if I want it to stay in place and not displace further). 

I seriously lacked motivation because I'm tired and I don't like myself, so why bother. 

But I made my resolve this week and began to take action, and for the first time in over a year (maybe more) I counted my calories to get a good deficit and exercised to further it more.

I am keeping on track today, but I may need advice or tips or some kind of support to keep going in the right direction.

Thanks."
"I want to start exercising but the potential for water weight freaks me out Hi!

I've been doing CICO pretty successfully since September. I'm 5'10"", female and 26. My starting weight was 290 and as of today I'm at 247 and super pleased with the results so far! This feels like the most sustainable weight loss attempt I've had. 

I want to start adding in some exercise in the form of cycling (I bought an upright bike in April with the thought of using it as stress relief. It's been gathering dust for... a while). My big hesitation is a silly one, and I think maybe I just need others to tell me it's silly and not a big deal, but the idea of the scale going up due to water weight brought on from exercising is really getting to me. I know it's not going to erase my progress, but I do get a little happy buzz from seeing the number trend downwards.

Edit: Thank you guys for the encouraging words! I'm still a bit worried about the potential uptick on the scale but I got off the couch and did 13.31km in 30 minutes. I feel dead but good! Now to turn this into a new habit. :)"

"Tips on how to start losing weight after a spine injury and surgery? I’ve asked my doctor this question but he was pretty vague and said just walk. I’m curious how much I should be walking, if I can walk on a treadmill, if I should only do 10 mins at a time, etc. I’m doing some core exercises but I don’t think that’ll help me lose weight. I’ll call his PA to get more info, but I’m curious what has worked for those who have had surgeries / injuries.

I’m 9 weeks post-op from my microdiscectomy and just weighed myself. I have gained 30+ lbs since my car accident (when the injury to my back occurred) 1.5 years ago and I yearn to be active one day again. Before the accident I ran with my dog every morning, went on hikes, etc. All that stopped due to the debilitating back pain so I became very sedentary. And now 9 weeks post op I am still sedentary other than walking around my complex with my dog once or twice a day. I’m so anxious about reinjuring myself, especially since I’m dealing with a lot of sciatica post op still. Trying to balance being safe while also starting to lose the weight I’ve put on.

Any tips??"
"I'm no longer diabetic This is a pretty big milestone in my journey.  I was nervous before my Doctor's appointment because I hadn't lost as much weight as I had wanted since the last check in.  

I ended up being 2lbs lighter than the last time I was there for an a1c check.  Not great, but I can't complain about weighing less.  Blood pressure was good so I was just waiting on the doc.  He comes in and doesn't sit down like usual, which I found odd.  Then he tells me my a1c dropped(I was diagnosed type 2 last Sept).  ""Good!""  is what I thought in my head.  A little drop is better than nothing.

Then he tells me it dropped from 6.9 to 6.3

And he says ""You are no longer in the diabetic range""

I didn't know how to act.  

He thinks the slowdown in weight loss is due to me starting to lift again, and wants to follow up with me in 6 months.  I started with an a1c of 7.4 last September.  

All I want to do is get off these meds, and that's a damn good update.  Hopefully if I stick with my routine and diet I can go ahead and get back to a normal life.  Feels good knowing the work I'm putting in is paying off.

Edit:  Thank you everyone.  I may be able to answer a few repeat questions better here.

My family has a history of obesity and health conditions like diabetes.  This was a nonfactor when I was active, but I went through a period in college where I was not happy.  Ate a lot of fast food and stayed indoors.  It carried through for a few years and got me here today.  I had to really dig deep and start loving myself to make the beginning of a change.

I started with cutting my fast food intake in half, and then eating ""healthy options"".  This dropped my first 20lbs.  At the time exercising was very difficult.  So this was the best I could do.  Eventually I pushed myself, and have now worked up to being able to workout 4-5 days a week.  I've also cut down my fast food consumption to about once a week now(for anyone struggling with this, it took me over a year to reach this level of discipline.  remind yourself what you should have eaten after fast food meals.  eventually you start choosing those options without thinking.  At least that's what I did.).

Believe it or not my diet has been aided by this 20 dollar crockpot I bought around christmas.  The recipes are easy, and knowing I have super tasty food at home keeps me from eating out.  I aim for 2 meals a day with snacks inbetween.  Keeps me from overeating, and if I ever feel low energy I just eat bigger meals.

Snacks consist mainly of apples and veggies(I lied mainly apples.  I need to eat more veggies).  The fiber fills me up and it's very hard to overeat on these foods.  Water helps too.  I TRY to drink a gallon a day. 

For a while I was doing an hour on the treadmill with an incline.  This worked from 295-280, then I had a stall.  My treadmill broke around the same time my friend started a home gym, so within the past month and a half I've been getting back into my college workouts(squats,bench,sqwats lol!).  I'm having fun in the gym again.  I've been focusing a lot on leg strength and jumping ability so I can play basketball for weight loss.  I managed to get a 36inch box jump off vert at 270!  That was a good moment.

So now I'm here.  Home scale says 260, which is about halfway to my goal of 205.  I know the meds will be here a while, but I want to have the option to get off them asap.  So I plan to work really hard before my next appointment.  I will have a lot of time in the summer, and normally if I have the energy I can drop weight fairly quick with enough rest.  I am trying to do this properly so I don't have a lot of loose skin, but now that I'm getting close to the turning point where every lb looks like a more drastic change, I'm ready to see it.

Look out for another good update in the next coming months.  Thank you guys for the support.  This community is awesome."
"I need some help. I keep stumbling. This is my umpteenth time trying to lose weight. I quit drinking 22 months ago so I know I am capable of remarkable things. But without alcohol to use as a crutch, I self-soothe with food. I recognize this in myself and have opened up a dialogue with my therapist about it. 

I am starting to worry that with so many false starts here, I may never make much progress. 

Right now, I am tracking my calories and focusing on getting 10k steps in a day. I hit 8k yesterday and I'm trying again today. 

I know this is an unfocused ask, but with alcohol, I learned just one small tidbit that changed the trajectory of my life. 

Dynorphen is a hormone released while drinking that dulls highs to sober you up. But it also dulls natural highs, which keep you in the drinking cycle...you need alcohol to experience the high. That made so much sense to me.

So, idk...hit me with your fat/food facts. Hit me with your sugar facts. Hit me with the realizations that changed your trajectory."
"People say diet is expensive because healthy foods cost more than non healthy ones. But what other costs has lowered since you start losing weight? Intuitively, healthy foods seems to be more expensive than other options. It is possible to find cheap alternatives and to not pay a lot more, though. But for me this requires planning and trying to find good deals. I don't know about you, but for me is that.

I had this office chair with compressed air and I thought it was defective. I would sit on it and it would go down... I was about to buy another one... but now it doesn't happen anymore. I realized I was above its weight limit and now I am not. So yeah, saved a few bucks there hehe

And I was wondering. What other costs in your life have lowered since you start losing weight?"
"How do you keep moving? So, for starters my SW is 280lbs and my CW is 261lbs at 5' 5"", As a  teen who struggles with body dysphoria and struggled with an unstable food environment I'm just begining my weight loss journey. I've been working out and trying to stay healthy but my weight loss has stagnated! I've been at 261 for almost a month, Help! I do an hour of cardio 3 days a week and between last week and now have increased that to 5. I wish more than anything to be able to play sports with my friends and be active but looking in the mirror does nothing but crush that. Even when I did interact with people I would always be the slowest of the bunch."
"Is it possible to lose weight on 1400 calories a day if I'm relatively sedentary? Hey everyone,
Apologies for any mistakes, I don't frequently make posts here, but am looking for some advice.
I'm female, 27 years old 5'6 and around 137 lbs.

I am relatively in shape but just trying to lose the extra pounds I have and tone up.

I have been finding it very difficult to lose this weight although I have been tracking calories, working out intensely for an hour a day (according to my fitness watch I burn around 250-400 calories during this, although I think that is a bit of an overshot, also worth mentioning that I do not eat exercise calories back) and sometimes incorporating a walk. Because I wasn't seeing much progress I came to the conclusion that working from home, I haven't been as active as I normally would be and I cut down my calories to 1200 a day.

This is where I am stuck. I began seeing faster progress but I felt awful, insomnia, irritable and tired and a preoccupation with food. I have now had to take a few days off exercise to feel normal again. I've realised that this figure was perhaps too low so I've decided to bump up to 1400 calories.

My question is, do you think this would be enough of a deficit to lose weight?

I appreciate that everyone's body is different and reacts in different ways, but any advice is appreciated all the same.

Thank you"
"I‘m always depressed on Sundays and this is when I binge During the week I usually do really well without having to think much about food because I keep myself busy. I even picked up a new hobby (inline skating) to keep myself even more distracted and to do something fun and active of course. 

Now the weather sucks again, so I can’t go skating, I don’t really have any friends, and I usually have nothing to do on Sundays. That’s always the moment I want to give up because I can’t make my feelings go away and I seemingly have nothing else to turn to in these moments. 

I‘m just frustrated I guess. I know that if I were distracted 24/7 like I am during the week, I could get my weight under control pretty quickly. But I keep ruining it on those damn Sundays. Then again I feel like, this can’t be it, right? Keeping myself busy and distracted to the point I can’t think or feel."
"Disbelief in weight loss, am I crazy or is it possible?? Hi! I just joined the community because I'm on a weight loss journey and honestly the internet isn't always helpful in answering my questions and I feel like having a supportive community will really help in my weight loss.

I'm a 5'3"" female and weighed in at 237 on February 15th. Today, I weighed myself and I was 196. This morning I helped my ex pack up a truck and leave our apartment, the relationship was stressful and we definitely didn't live a healthy lifestyle. I picked up running and I've been eating 1200 calories a day for about 2 weeks and trying to exercise every day as well. Between the 25th of February (223.8lbs, also on period so that definitely added weight) and today (196.8lbs) I've lost almost 30 lbs...is this possible? Is it maybe stress weight that I've lost? I usually sit at 185, im trying to get to 150, is my body trying to normalize back to 185? I don't believe myself that im losing weight, but I know I am because my clothes are fitting much better.

Can someone help explain this?"
"Weight loss with low BMR (1200kcal)? Should I reverse diet? Any other ideas? I am F27 167cm (5ft6in) 88kg (194lbs) and just recently I’ve done a test on my metabolic health (the one you breathe into a mask for 5 minutes) and was told that my BMR is around 1200kcal. I believe this is a result of my yo yo dieting and problems with hormones. 

What would be the best way to tackle fat loss?

Right now I am having 1400-1500kcal, focusing on my protein intake, doing no less than 7k steps a day and  kettlebell workouts 3-4 a week (at home, since gyms are still closed here) but I am barely losing any weight... And I know patience is key, but having this strict routine and not seeing changes is just so demotivativating. I just probably need some ideas or opinions what would be the best way for weight loss in my situation?

I’ve heard reverse diet helps with metabolic adaptation, but I really want to lose some weight at the moment..."
"30 pounds by july hi, i just started using reddit. i am currently trying to lose 30ish pounds by july 1st. i’m 5’1” and 173 pounds

the only time i really lost weight was when i took 1/2 of a diet pill (phentermine) every other day. i would use the elliptical first thing in the morning, anywhere from 15-40 minutes, drink a protein shake, eat a fake meat patty and vegetable for lunch, and cereal for dinner. i wanna guess my calorie intake was around 800 per day... i was young, maybe 19. now i’m 26 and i know this will no longer work for me... my before and after pictures were so different, and i had only lost 10-12 pounds in 12 weeks so i know it was pure fat that came off.

i’ve gained 40 pounds since 2018 and when i try dieting, my weight yo-yo’s. my plan now is to eat 1,200 calories but some days i hit 1,300-1,700 :( trying to do better. 

does anyone else share a similar goal of 30 pounds by july 1st?"
"Protein powder question This question may sound silly, but it is bugging me and I’d like to hear some input from people with experience.

I have been told that protein powder will cause weight gain even if you are eating at a significant deficit and exercising considerably: that as long as protein powder is being consumed, weight loss will not be realistic. 

I have been told the calories do not matter in the protein powder and that weight gain will happen no matter what. 

Can anyone add to why this is or refute this? It doesn’t make sense to me. 

Or is this the case for only certain people (ie females, people with thyroid problems, women with PCOS)?"

"Will the cravings ever go Away? Hi Guys

My question is will the cravings/binge eating ever go away?

Long story short I am 24 years old and my highest weight was 418lbs and now I am down to 198lbs. I am very proud of myself and what I have accomplished. But I am typing this out and feeling very depressed as I have pretty much eaten a pint of ice cream and other snacks tonight. I am staying this weekend at my parents house where there is loads of unhealthy food and I am just not disciplined to say no to certain foods no matter how full I am. I really thought that now I am much healthier that I would’ve changed and been disciplined enough to say no. I pride myself in being a very disciplined person as I don’t drink, can abstain from porn/self pleasure, only smoke on occasion with friends, but cannot say no to Food. I am very disappointed in myself."
"I struggled today with eating too much I am new to this. Im counting calories. Im starting my third week next week. The problem is that I am starting to feel a little tired of counting. Today I have felt so hungry. I have a difficult time knowing how to spread out the amount of calories i should eat. I ate like 200 calories for breakfast. Like 300 or even less for lunch. After that I was really hungry. Felt dizzy too.   
Then I ate dinner at like 5 pm which was almost 600 calories. According to the app I am using i should eat 2500 but I am trying to lie 500 calories under that.   


I ate a sallad recently that was like 100 calories. I want to eat more but I want to stay 500 calories under. I did a exercise video that says that it burns 500 calories. IF thats true(it was really difficult I have more than a 1000 calories left to eat. I want to eat but I am so afraid of feeling bad for eating.   
It stresses me out to now know what to do.   
How do you deal with it? How do you eat in a way that still makes you function and not feel bad?"
"Could use some help getting motivated to seek a therapist for disordered eating. Backstory: I grew up in an abusive household with almost no access to food. Binge eating kept me alive. When I moved out at 18 I was so poorly acclimated to stable food that I gained 100lbs in less than six months before I realized what I had done to my body.  

A few years ago I lost about 60lbs through calorie counting, getting treatment for my asthma, and consequently finally being able to exercise! 
But then financial tragedy hit, I lost access to my gym and asthma medicine, I was stressed and food insecure, which triggered my binge eating and I gained a lot of weight back. Got it under control, lost 20 or so pounds, sat there for a while since I was still struggling financially and stressed.    

Then covid hit too. Spouse and I lost our jobs. We were eating rice and beans we got from charitable neighbors for two months- we were ineligible for a lot of aid since we got most of our income from self employment. Cue more food insecurity and when we did start getting paid again it was inconsistent so I was binging, starving, binging again. I gained more weight and now I'm the biggest I've ever been. 

We are financially stable again. I have a job and insurance and I'm about to get back on my asthma treatments for the first time in a few years.  I want to seek therapy for my disordered eating but I'm worried that since it only happens in bursts as a result of triggers which will hopefully not be present anymore, that therapy will help me out for now, I'll get comfortable and lower my guard, and I'll get triggered again years down the line and ruin all my progress once more. 

Did therapy help you overcome disordered eating on a long term basis? What were your takeaways from therapy? How did they help you? Ive only been to one therapist in my life, one visit, and she shamed me for being queer, told me to leave my partner and change my whole lifestyle and it overwhelmed me so much I never saw a therapist again.  I could really use some support and encouragement  here because I'm sitting here looking at what seems like a perfect therapist, and 12 free sessions this year through my job, and I still have this awful feeling in my gut that it will be a terrible idea. 

**TLDR: Binge eating caused by trauma gets triggered every several years. Feel like a therapist would help but it makes me anxious. Encouraging words and advice?**"
"I’ve hit a weight loss plateau Hey guys, so I (21F/CW148/GW137) gained about 30lb in college and now i finally lost it, however to reach my goal weight, I still needed to lose more but it’s been very hard. 

I go to the gym 5 times a week, 2 days cardio and 3 days lifting, eat approx 1200 calories a day and drink once a week. 

Since I started the weight loss journey I allowed myself to have a shitty eating day (usually the day after drinking) and until now it worked for me. But now I have stopped losing weight. What do you guys recommend? I need the one social drinking day that I have, so do you guys have any suggestions beside giving up on drinking once a week?"
"Binge help Hey, y’all. I am a Binge eater. I’ve never confessed this before and I’d like help. 

It all started when I was little. In high school I weighed 300lbs. At 16 I dropped the weight down to 198lbs. I’m currently about 220lbs and muscular. So, I haven’t really regained fat, but I’d still like to tighten up more and the binge eating every night does halt progress.

I eat normally through the day and then I’ll go to bed and wake up after an hour or two and just go all out on oatmeal, protein powder, or whatever is around. I don’t keep non-nutrient dense food in the house, but still, excess calories are excess calories. 

This cycle has been ongoing for what seems like years. I just want to break it already. Any tips and help would be appreciated. There’s really no trigger. I could be having a great day or a horrible day and the outcome would be the same. 

I’ve tried eating lighter through the day and then a big meal before bed and I’m not sure I’ve noticed a difference. That’s what I’m trying tonight again. 

Food choices through the day are always filling. Protein heavy. Fruits and veggies. I drink over a gallon of water a day too. 

I’m just lost and need tips for what helped you. I need to be held accountable. I’m glad I admitted this, but this is only the start to my recovery. Thanks everyone."
"Huge fan of this sub! Do you have any advice? F/26 5ft6 SW: 179 CW: 168 GW: 155

I posted this over on r/CICO but figured I should post it here as well -

I seem to have hit a bit of a wall after starting CICO since the start of the year. l'd been doing CICO before that but ended up burning out pretty quick and repeatedly because was restricting too much.


I had an amazing January and lost 8lbs, so was full of motivation to keep at it to hopefully get to my goal by the end of April. In February, I only lost 1.81lbs so was a bit disappointed, and have been stalling around the 167-169 mark for over three weeks.

In terms of tracking, I'm very accurate and count all my sauces and oils. I'm eating about 1400-1650cals, and do about 1.25-2 hours of dog walking each day. know can be very impatient and self-critical because the fact that had such a great January and haven't made that same level in progress in February/March has made me a bit disappointed in myself and I have already failed.

I track calories on MFP and usually never eat back exercise calories, maybe 10-20% on some days."
"My job is presenting me with temptations that I have a hard time refusing. Advice needed! I (18F) (start weight: 200, current: 170, goal: 140) currently work at Domino's Pizza. 

Before I started at the good ol' pizza shop about 4 months ago, I was able to steadily lose weight. I started a year or so ago at about 200 pounds and eventually made it to where I am now at 170 pounds. 

Now, no matter what I do it seems like I cannot go up or down. For example, today I had 500 calories in vegetables and fruits. I head to work at 4:00, proud of myself for having been healthy so far. But the split SECOND I am presented with something unhealthy I cannot resist. 

I simply don't understand how to control myself. When I'm at home and there's no temptations, I eat healthy and fine. But then it is almost always made obsolete with my inability to refuse brownies and pizza at work. 

I will take any advice I can get. I am still 30 pounds from my goal but at this rate, I will forever be 170 and it's destroying my confidence and motivation."

"Struggling to understand the concept of maintenance calories for someone at my weight (283lbs) With the blessing of my doc because I’m extremely sedentary, I’m eating 1300 calories a day. I’ve been doing this for 3 months and I haven’t had a single cheat day because I haven’t felt that it’s been difficult at all. In fact if I would’ve known it was going to be this easy I would’ve done this way sooner. So anyway as you can imagine I’ve been losing weight steadily. 

But I’m struggling to understand TDEE and the concept of maintenance calories. I am 30f, 5’6. My maintenance calories according to a few different online calculators are 2,624. That’s more than DOUBLE what I’m easily consuming now. I see posts from people who talk about how on days when they’re struggling they just “bump it up to maintenance for a few days”.. which makes it seem like their maintenance is not much higher than their weight loss calories... but if I did that I would be more than doubling my calories for a few days. 

From what I understand, maintenance is supposed to *maintain* weight, not gain weight. How would more than doubling my calories not make me gain weight?

Also, why even is my TDEE SO high?

Edit: I should also add I didn’t start out doing 1300, I started at 1600 and then lowered it down to 1300"
"Feeling sad TLDR: Self esteem not doing too well due to weight and school grades 

Hey. I’m not sure if this is really the right sub for this, but I’m posting here since weight has to do with it. I’ve been overweight since about 2nd grade, so pretty much my whole life. It didn’t really affect me until me towards the end of middle/start of high school though, when I realized how different I looked compared to everyone else. I decided something had to change so I’ve been working on changing my eating habits.

The losing weight thing has been going pretty well. But something came up and I’m just sad. Growing up I was always really good in school. “Gifted” with straight As, barely needing to study. Middle school came around and I had to study but I still did good. High school, and I just failed two geometry tests, getting a 71 on one and a 77 on the other. I studied pretty hard for these, and I still failed. I always thought math was one of my strongest subjects, so this is upsetting to see. Not to mention getting a lot of 80s in biology and history. 

I already felt terrible about how I looked, but now I’m doing terrible in school too. I have no clue where my strengths lie anymore. Art maybe, but even then I don’t know."
"I need to lose 70 lbs ASAP. 26F, CW: 273, GW: 160-150.

I plan to start my acting career in 2021. So I need to step up my weight loss journey by a LOT. I’ve been doing everything that I can. Granted, My eating habits still aren’t the best. I’m working on it. I need to stick to 1,500 calories, Anything less I felt too faint for my weight or anything above that will make me gain more as I’m training. So it’s a good start for me. Eventually as I lose more I’d like to lower it to 1,200 when I get closer to 210 lbs. Now I almost gave up my acting career over the weekend before I even started it. I’ve been in one play recently with a lead role and I loved it. I still want to go for it since it’s something I really want to do!! 

Anyway back to my weight. Like I said I haven’t been eating the best, I had a cheat weekend which I haven’t done in a long time, I just gave into a few small cravings and didn’t over indulge like I used to do. I was careful and actually lost 3 lbs this weekend! I was shocked. I have been trying to drink more water, Haven’t really been counting but it’s at least 100+ Oz. The serving is 42 when I fill up my water filter half way, And I drink at least 3 a day. I won’t be having another cheat day for a while, Because it made me feel like crap. It literally made me sick and I still don’t feel well from yesterday. 

I need to lose exactly 12 lbs a month to lose 70 lbs before this year has ended. I will have an extra month in December, I hope I won’t get too off track by then. I’ve hit a pause for the last two weeks. But once I get back into meal prepping I should be fine right? I usually lose about 3 lbs a week when I do this, Which is too fast for most but it’s what I need! I was never in such a rush before, But I want to look my best so I can start sending out those acting auditions. I don’t think I’m in an obsessive state yet, And I am being careful. I don’t workout for long hours, In fact I mostly only have 30 minutes at the gym since my ride is always late but I am going to start getting there early and workout for a full hour again! My arms are already tightening/getting smaller, That’s always the hardest part but it was small when I was training before so maybe that’s why it only took 3 weeks this time around. My chest is still huge but not as bad as it was- I can tell by my size, it doesn’t fit anymore. I’ve noticed that I lost most of the fat in my back, Which was quite hard to get rid of as well. So it’s mostly upper body that I need to work on, My lower body is pretty good right now but I will be keeping up with both. I think HIIT will help with that. 

Anyway, Is this possible to lose 70 lbs before the year is over? Have you done it or lost even more in 9 months?"
"A post for accountability Hello everyone. I hope you've had a good week.

I started trying to lose weight in October last year and from October 1st to like mid December I lost 7 kg (about 15 pounds). But ever since then I started to lose focus and started bad eating habits again. At first I just plateaued, but ever since mid January, maybe it was coincidence, maybe causation, when I started studying for my exams, I let myself go big time and gained back about 3 kg (6.6 pounds). Now that my exams are over, I am having a hard time getting my eating habits back on track.

At least I still do home workouts with a friend (just digitally, of course) 3 times a week and if the weather and Covid regulations allow it, I will be able to go horseback riding again every other week, so I have the exercise part covered.

I wanted to make a post to make myself more accountable and comment to update on my weekly progress. I hope this will also give me back some of my motivation to eat healthier.

Well, as of today, March 7 2021, I weight 74 kg (163 pounds). My goal is to lose between 500 g to 1 kg per week (1 to 2 pounds) and my goal weight is 60 kg (132 pounds).

See you next week if you like to.

Have a great Sunday and a successful next week!"
"How to reduce diabetes This might not be the best subreddit to post this question but I’ve seen some really amazing posts on controlling diabetes in this subreddit. 

My family has a long history of diabetes and I’ve recently got diagnosed of diabetes a few years back (when I was 17) and now I am 21. My A1C is 7.8 and I really want to get it under 6.5. I weigh around 220 pounds and I am 5 foot 6. More than weight loss I really want to reduce my diabetes and I know they come hand in hand so that’s 2 birds in one stone for me! 

Anyone who was in a similar situation, what worked for you? Food, exercise that reduced your glucose levels after eating a meal? 

I wanna conquer this beast of a disease and I am also really scared that diabetes will take my life away.


Also as of now I am not taking any medication (trying to control it through diet)"
"Should I avoid talking to her about my weight loss? Hey guys. Recently, after falling off the weight loss wagon, I curiously took a look at my weight on the scale and was surprised to see that the changes I made in activity (walking 45-50 minutes to work and back home everyday and in the past week biking the distance,) helped me lose weight! I remember being 190 pounds at one point, and the other day it was 176. I didn't even notice the difference, maybe it was due to me drinking less soda too? But I talked more seriously about getting a planet fitness membership and ""drinking just water"" with my significant other (not totally dieting) and she responded to me with this. 

((I guess ive not been clear enough but I hate talking about it. Weight is a huge negative trigger for me :,) seeing someone your size (literally my dream body) say ""omg im so obese lol i need to lose soooo much weight"" when im literally stuck at 260+ pounds because of my depression makes me lowkey want to die 😎))

She hasn't told me to NOT lose weight and doesn't discourage me from it, but she has discouraged me from relying on the BMI scale to define whether I'm obese (it was 31 or 32 when I was 190.) And that I don't need to lose weight I look fine. But I want to become healthier and an average weight for my height. (21F 5 feet 5 inches) I want to do whatever kind of activity I want and not get tired so quickly. 

I guess my point is, do you guys think I should stop talking with her about it if it'll make her uncomfortable? I mean I'll have to say no thanks to food sometimes and I have a gallon water bottle I'm solely going to be drinking water from in an effort to increase water intake and keep myself full longer. I'm also very interested in going and beginning strength training/HIIT at planet fitness so I'll have to tell her like this is where I'm going I'll be back by etc. But aside from these things, do you think I should avoid celebrating my victories with her? Should I avoid sharing healthier meals with her? To not hurt her feelings and trigger her?"
"NSV after only two weeks!! Some info: 23F / SW: 240 / CW: 235 / GW 120 5’0

I knew that eating healthier and exercise would give me some benefits immediately, but I did not expect to notice them so quickly! 

My husband and I decided enough was enough and two weeks ago we would start steps to develop lifelong healthy habits. We started focusing on CICO and eating more fruits/veggies with at least every meal. I’ve also been adding more walks and some at home exercises such as  push-ups, sit ups, and some YouTube workout videos. 

Within two weeks, I have already lost five pounds which I was pleased with. We decided to do a non-food treat that should encourage us to keep going. 

Before, my back would start to hurt after walking around the store without a cart around the 15 min mark. Today, we walked around with no cart for about 30 min and it didn’t hurt! My back is already getting stronger and my body is adjusting. 

I can’t wait to continue with it and see what results well have in a month, two months, six months, a year! Thank you all for supporting this community and for posting your stories. It has been a tremendous source of inspiration and support for me!"
"Weight Loss Journey Begins! Hi All,

First Post for me, I've been a massive lurker here! Trying to see what might work for me and see other people's experiences.

I'm Male(25), 5ft 4 (wasn't blessed with a tall gene!) and now come in at 202lbs.
Looking at healthy weight calculators; I should be coming in at around 145lbs. Now I haven't been that weight for nearly 7 years; it's crept on incredibly slowly. Being in a relationship has been great, but as we're extremely comfortable together; it was more about enjoyment then taking care of ourselves.

I've managed to lose about 2 stone before but I just get so bored! Eating salad really really bores me. I didn't have healthy food practices instilled in me when growing up; so I struggle. So it piles back on. Lockdown hasn't helped either due to motivation; and I haven't been able to exercise well for about 5 years as I had undiagnosed compartment syndrome in both legs (managed to get them operated in December last year) and I'm now able to walk without intense pain.

I really want to stay motivated; but do struggle. I'm fine managing my breakfasts and lunch; I have no control over dinner apart from portion sizing and not having takeaways due to living with family (not a good cook, not an excuse though).

Just thought I'd post a bit about me, and visit here for motivation. I really struggle with having an off day, and just fall off the wagon.

What do you all do to stay motivated; and get motivated to exercise? ( I teach too so I'm largely sedentary).

Anyway, whether you reply or not - it feels a relief to type this out somewhere and start taking responsibility. Thank you for taking the time to read this!"
"How to cope with wrong self body image after significant weightloss So i’ve been on a weightloss journey since 2019, I went from 73kgs to 55kgs (now). There have been so many changes throughout the years, ups and downs until i finally hit my plateau.

Keep in mind that i had been overweight (for my short posture) since my early teenage years. At that point, I cant even remember the last time my weight considered normal, so i have this fixed image in my head about how i look, a self body image of my chubby self, fast forward 3 years and i still have that image in my head even though in reality i don’t look like that anymore.

Every single time i look at a mirror, I’m not seeing what others actually see, i look at my self thinking i still need to lose weight when in fact I don’t. The only way i could believe what i see is when I look at candid photos of me that my friends took, this has been so annoying and unhealthy for me.

I just wish somone, anyone, have tips on getting rid this body image so i could work on my self esteem:("
"No longer the biggest guy at the table I've been fat all my life. I'm 57. 

I never took losing weight seriously until I was married and had a daughter on the way, weighing in excess of 350 pounds. I began low-carb dieting in 2003, and went from my all time high of 364 to 270 or so...then stuck there for years. I dabbled sometimes, getting as low as 240, but probably still spent a decade doing that bounce-around. I never got above 280 again, but I got close, and then I'd lose a bit here and again. I'm 5'10"" tall.

Since I'd experienced life at 350+, I was *kind* of satisfied. There is a huge functional difference with 100 pounds gone. You feel it in everything you do. 

During the pandemic, I decided I wanted more. I stuck more seriously to carb restriction and added a 16-hour fast, which was both surprisingly easy and amazingly effective. I am now at 214 pounds and losing 3-4 pounds a month. My fasts sometimes go 20 hours -- and I hardly notice. 

I also gave up the gym due to Covid and instead of strength training, I added on running. I've probably lost at least some muscle in the transition, but my belly and face are much smaller now.

Anyway, I realized something the other day. Was at dinner with some work colleagues who I've worked with for years.  Never considered either of them overweight, and they asked about it. I was the lightest guy at the table by a good 15 pounds. Among my friends, I'm lighter than most all of them. Two of my three brothers are heavier than me, and the other isn't much lighter. I realize that I'm not remarkably overweight these days. 

It's kind of an eye-opening moment when you consider how used to being the fat guy, the big guy, the roundest guy around -- and suddenly you *aren't*. Being a forever-fat guy, I realized that my whole identify was wrapped up in it. It was my most distinguishing characteristic. It's a good feeling, and I'm certainly not done losing weight now, but it's almost disconcerting. 

I guess I'm saying it feels a little like an adventure to me. At my age, there isn't that much new in the world, with kids, life and career occupying most of your attention and time. I'm definitely the same person I always was, but in some ways, I've been divorced from a core (and toxic) part of my self-image."
"Finally starting to see progress! Hi there! So I am new to this subreddit and I just wanted to share how my weight loss journey started and how things are going.

In May of 2020, I (24F, 5'6"") was diagnosed with a metabolic/hormonal condition called PCOS. I was at a fairly normal weight for my height back in high school, but it progressively got worse throughout college. I figured it was just due to the stress and lack of sleep, but after getting my diagnosis it made a lot more sense since weight gain is one of the main symptoms of the condition. Throughout most of my time in college, I was roughly 238 lbs and would fluctuate +/-2 lbs. I tried to work out when I could in between my classes and job, but nothing was really working. When I got my diagnosis last year that's when I realized I really needed to do something about it, especially since my condition puts me at risk for type 2 diabetes (which I already had a risk of genetically since my mom has it).

Anyways, over the past year since the diagnosis, I started to make small changes in my eating habits such as switching from my refined carb intake to whole grains, reducing my sugar intake, eating more protein and healthy fats, etc. I also started to walk every day and swim a couple of times a week. When I followed up with my doctor in October, I had dropped down to 231. It honestly didn't feel like much, but my doctor commended me for it. I then started working a job that requires a lot of walking and lifting (I work in a special ed classroom as an assistant, it definitely keeps me active). I kept up with what I was doing but slacked during December because our classroom had to quarantine and the pool I swam at closed.

I got back on it in February and joined a gym thanks to a discount, and got two free sessions with a personal trainer (I can't afford to buy a program unfortunately), but in the first session, he showed me some resistance exercises I can do in addition to my swimming and other cardio. The first one focused on upper body exercises, the second one when I have it will focus on lower body and abs. I will get to keep meeting with the trainer monthly but just as a check-in about my goals since I'm not doing a program. I've also started going to a yoga class once a week and am really enjoying it as well.

As for my progress, I just weighed myself at the gym yesterday and I dropped down to 224.6 lbs! I was so happy, I've officially lost about 14 lbs since my diagnosis and I'm going to keep working hard at it so I can get my BMI below 30! And this also feels amazing because a shirt that used to be a bit snug on me, fits better now than it used to! So I know that it's working and I just wanted to share with you all. PCOS is known to make it difficult for women who have it to lose weight and the solutions for dealing with the symptoms associated with are also variable, I'm glad that I've finally found something that is working! :D So even if you are struggling and/or have a condition like this, there is hope, don't give up!"
"Addicted to take out and don't know what to do :( Hi friends, this is partially a vent post but if anyone has been through something similar I would be really grateful for any advice.

Around June 2020 I had a few serious personal issues crop up on a couple fronts and stopped taking care of myself. I do have a therapist and am in a better mental place now but I haven't stopped my terrible dietary habits. I've gained 50 pounds over the past ~7 months, I have stretch marks now, I get out of breath walking up 2 flights of stairs. I hate myself but I can't seem to make myself stop ordering food.

I don't seem to enjoy any part of the process. As soon as I get the compulsion to order food, the dread sets in. Once I order it (and I always do), I feel immediate shame and disgust. It arrives and I eat all of it even though it makes me sick and cry, then I go to sleep hating myself. 

My therapist is aware of the issue but no one in my life knows the extent of it. I spent over $1000 on takeout last month alone. I'm wrecking my financial health as well as my physical health and feel completely out of control. I used to be so fit and frugal and I just don't recognize myself now. I need to change"
"Long time lurker, first time poster. I've been following this page for the last little while in hopes that it will motivate me to finally fight for my happiness. This post is a bit all over the place, so I apologise in advance!

I'm not obese or that overweight by any means, and I know that my current weight is a lot of people's goal weight. 

I've dealt with anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and everything in between. 3 years ago I moved to NZ to be with my boyfriend, and it's been a journey (in terms of my health). 

I joined a diet centre when I was 18 because some guy stopped talking to me because he thought I was fat. I had always been the big girl in class since I was a kid, so this hurt me. 

Worst. Decision. Of. My. Life. This honestly ruined me. I know that so many people have found success with CICO, and I wish I could because it seems to work really well for so many people. But this lead to so many obsessive behaviours that I'm still trying to shake to this day (I'm 29 now). 

I moved to Vancouver when I was 20 to attend university, while in a long distance relationship with a guy back home (Montreal). I got depressed, dropped out of uni, gained all the weight that I had lost when I was 18, and then some. I think the highest I ever weighed was about 200lbs. I'm 5'6"" and carry it all in my mid section. So I wasn't feeling too great about myself, as you can imagine. Managed to lose some of it, I think I got down to 170lbs through yoga and running.

When I was 22 I moved to Australia and for some reason just stopped caring about calories, was drinking heaps, but I was super active (going to the gym 5x a week with one of our flatmates and snowboarding almost every day). The weight seemed to melt off. I think I got down to 160lbs, but I still thought I was fat. Although I remember this time fondly because I ate food and enjoyed it.

A few years later, Australian boyfriend and I broke up, and I moved back to Canada. Stopped drinking, joined a gym, was cycling everywhere, rock-climbing, hiking, snowboarding and everything in between. Fittest I had ever looked and felt in my life. I think I got down to 145lbs (but it still wasn't enough). 

Wasn't really sure what I was doing with my life, jumped between cities, gained weight, lost weight. 

Finally ended up moving to NZ 3 years ago to be with my partner (whom I met in Australia). Weight's gone up and down but has consistently been around 175lbs. Fitness is non existent at the moment (my partner has a broken spine from snowboarding so the activities we can do together that don't cause him more pain are limited). Started eating everything and anything, but I have stopped counting calories. I've been enjoying a lot of foods, but I still don't feel great in my skin. I look at pictures of myself and I don't like what I see. 

I've tried doing Whole30 on and off (and I'm currently doing one now - on day 22). I downloaded MFP the other night just for fun, I thought I might be in the right headspace to use it effectively after all these years. Nope. Binged on RxBars and everything else tonight. 

And so I have realised that I am still not where I need to be with my relationship with myself, and food. I've come a hell of a long way, but there's still work to be done. 

I want to do it right for me. Right for my boyfriend. I am so tired of letting food control me and this idea that I have to ""work out"" when all I want is to enjoy food, enjoy activities, and enjoy life. I'm currently at 163 lbs and my goal is 145-150lbs. This is where I feel good. Not perfect, but really good. I've never had a six-pack and I don't think I ever will. And that's okay! I don't need one, but I do want to feel comfortable and capable.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for reading if you've made it this far. This post ended up being a lot longer than I thought. Tomorrow is a new day!"
"Don’t always choose sedentary when looking at tdee. A lot of people recommend sedentary no matter what your life style is and often recommend 1,200 calories for women despite their lifestyle. 

My sedentary would have me at 1,400 to lose 1 pound a week. Well I really thought that was wrong and that my actual tdee was closer to 2300 so I could eat 1700 and lose a pound per week. A lot of people suggested to me that I eat 1200 and it wasn’t possible my tdee was that high. 

Well I’ve been eating 1700 for 4 weeks now and have been losing 2 pounds a week (so from 180 to 172) at a very steady rate. I went to the doctor a few days ago and he took measurements and ran some tests to find out my fat/muscle composition and asked a lot of questions about my activity levels and determined my tdee was definitely between 2500-2800. 

He recommended I stay above 1500 since I’m apparently pretty active and he thinks I need the extra calories. I waitress and have a second job as an artist (doing murals or teaching) so I’m on my feet for 8+ hours a day and run for a mile or 2 run in the morning and life weights and stuff) 

In other words if you really feel your tdee is higher than sedentary they just try it higher for a few weeks. Give it 3 weeks at 1500 or 1700 or even 2000 and see if you notice any changes. There is no rush in weight loss. I actually only wanted to lose 1 pound a week because I only have 30 (22 now) to lose so I was just gonna get it done in 30 weeks. 

If you notice changes then just stay at that higher calorie until you stop seeing changes. If you don’t see changes then you can lower it. It’s all trial and error. You don’t have to eat 1200 a day being an active person and feeling like crap because you’re burning so much. Do what’s best for you and don’t believe everyone who preaches always choosing sedentary despite your activity level. If you’re active you’ll appreciate the extra calories and your workouts will thank you."

"Where do I start? What’s a decent place to learn and get information? TL;DR: I (25F) was always naturally skinny and now that I’ve gained weight I realize I know nothing about how food actually works or what it takes to eat healthy. Looking for tips, advice, or just stories to relate to. 

I guess I can start with some background here. Growing up my family was kinda poor. We survived, but food was always cheap and a “eat what you get” ideology. I was also always naturally skinny. To the point where family asked me if I was anorexic even though I was constantly eating. This persisted through most of college. I would just eat what ever and my metabolism was so high it didn’t matter. 

A couple of years ago I was hanging out with a work friend (pre-pandemic) and we were looking through old photos, and she made a comment about how I used to be SO skinny in high school (but not like in mean way). It kinda jarred me though. And now (post-pandemic) I weigh even more than I did when that comment was made. 

I’m not super overweight by any means, but I’m also not the super skinny person I was used to being. I want to try and lose like 20 lbs. I can see the weight gain now and my self-esteem is shot. My face is fatter, I have a beer gut, and I have stretch marks all over my thighs and hips. I really want to get back into shape but I don’t know where to start. 

I don’t have a job right now, so I can’t really buy a lot of the foods I want. But it’s finally not -10F outside so I’m going to start walking/jogging again. Other than that I don’t really know where to start. 

I’ve looked a little bit into fasting (Intermittent and OMAD). But I realized that I basically already do that. I just don’t understand how to actually plan my meals and count calories and things like that. Like, I don’t think its healthy OMAD to just eat a big bowl of spaghetti for dinner lol. Being poor has left me with some really bad habits. Because a bowl of pasta or a couple potatoes is better than not eating I guess. 

I’ve slowly been getting more and more into cooking. And not the “just buy everything pre-made and warm it up” kind of cooking, but actually making stuff from scratch. I don’t really follow recipes except for baking. But without recipes I don’t really know anything about what I’m making. Sure I can cook a piece of salmon with some veggies and potatoes, but I have no idea how portions work, or what kinda nutrients are in the food, or how many calories I’m eating, etc. 

Where do I even begin in trying to learn about diets and nutrition? How do you make nutritious food? How do you know what you need? How do you make serving sizes when you cook for yourself? How do you track your calorie intake and outtake? What actually does it take to eat and live healthier? Do you just google everything you put into your recipes? Because that sounds super tedious and I doubt I could keep the motivation to do that. I’ve also been curious about meal-prep but I don’t know anything about that either. 

Thanks for reading my novel. If anyone has advice or stories to share about their journey I would very much appreciate it. Oh and I’m also a pescatarian so my protein needs to come from fish and vegetarian sources if anyone has tips on that too."
"I'm a diet soda addict and I can't stop. Advices? I've lost over 88 lbs in the past 2 years and a half. I'm still trying to lose the last 15 pounds even though it's been a struggle. I became a diet coke Addict last year and I've been drinking it non stop every single day. I'm talking about 2 full bottles a day. Lately my urge to Binge has been through the roof, I watch eating videos to curb my hunger, I dream about what I would eat if I could binge all day and I believe that diet soda is what's causing all of it. However I can't stop it. If I don't have it in my house I go crazy, I wake up in the middle of the night wanting something sweet and when I have nothing to snack on or my soda to drink I lose my sh*t. It's like a drug addiction but it's messing with my weight loss journey and controls my life. Please feel free to share some tips or anything that could help."
"I have no idea how to lose weight Hi, i’m a long time watcher on this sub but i have never posted. I am a female (5’7) 160lb and i play basketball high level. I am not a very fat looking woman but i am too chubby that the scouts for college told me i need to drop 20lb for them to consider me for a scholarship. 

The problem is i have no idea how to lose weight at all. When i try to follow basic rules such as CICO i just get hungry and binge eat. I need this scholarship and i am certain i would get it if i could drop this extra weight, so i was hoping you could drop any tips or things that have helped you for someone at the start of their weight loss journey. 

also please excuse my poor english as this is not my first language and i have struggled with it for a while.

any tips would be great!"
"When do you know you’re done? I’m a 31(f). 5’8- went from 193 to 153.2.

My goal is 145. Mostly because it sounded good. I have a larger frame, I am not interested in dipping much lower than that. It just doesn’t look as good on me as someone with a smaller frame. 

Anyway- I’ve been kind of stuck the last couple weeks. I know that I could probably reach my goal. But I don’t know if I want to restrict my calories more to do so.

How do you decide you’re done? Do you stick with original goal? 

Would you up your movements to encourage the last couple pounds to drop?

Once you reach your goal- how do you just stop? I have this fear of just ballooning up again if I let go now."
"Has anyone used the Second Nature program? As the title says, I’m looking for experiences using the Second Nature 12 week program. 

It seems straightforward enough... no calorie counting, but they give you a meal plan. Complex carbs are restricted to 3 portions per day and one meal with none. There’s a group chat element and the opportunity to chat with a nutritionist.

It’s fairly expensive (think it works out as about £110 for the whole thing) but it is apparently used by the NHS and has some good reviews. One benefit to me is the structure, because I’m struggling to get started at the moment. 

However, I’m wondering if I’m better to just try and motivate myself and calorie count. 

Anyone used it?"
"Ok... let's talk stomach noises... mine are SO MUCH LOUDER Now, obviously I have always had gut-related sounds in my life. I think the technical term is borborygmus. But since I've lost around 50lbs (about half of the weight I need to lose) things have gotten much, much louder. 

I don't think I've necessarily changed my diet too much. I just eat smaller portions and do CICO. I suppose I do eat more veg, but it still doesn't feel like much more. And yet... I can literally hear food move out of my stomach and my guts doing their digestivey thing in a way I could not before.

So my main theory is because I have lost fat over my stomach/abdomen the sounds are just louder due to there not being insulating fat covering the area. Maybe?

My question is... has anyone else noticed this happening to them???"
"I need to set myself a calorie count, but my activity level varies wildly from day to day This is my first time posting so bear with me on this. I'm a 24 FtM trans man who has been on T for two years but has seen little weight loss b/c of it, only fat redistribution. A few months back I started up a new diet and began keeping track of my steps and my heart rate as well as calories. I fell off the wagon a few weeks ago but even before then I found myself hitting a wall. I came down from 210 to 185 but couldn't get any lower than that. Considering I'm only 5'1, clearly I can do better. 

I think the biggest issue is my calorie count. I was sticking to a general 2,300 but found after a while that on busy days I could only eat 3 meals instead of the 4 I normally need, whereas it was almost too many calories on not busy days. 

For me, busy days means working a shift at both of my jobs. I wake up at 6am and clock in to the first at 7am, then switch at 1pm to the other job where I stay till after 9pm. I'm on my feet nearly the entire day, moving, sweating, and staying active (my step counter is usually between 15 and 20k on these days). I typically have a pre-prepared light breakfast like a protein shake or some eggs, a heavier lunch at the first job, then dinner at the second, and finally another light meal once I get home. The 2300 calorie count severely restricted what I could eat during these days, so I'd often skip one of the meals or eat something tiny, which often  resulted in me feeling sick from hunger for hours. (Ever since I started T, being too hungry gives me awful acid reflux so I try to avoid it when I can) 

Conversely, on days when I'm off, I still feel like I need to eat a ton but am not actually hungry enough to get the whole 2300 calories down. I'd often just snack lightly throughout the day, have dinner, and end up somewhere around 1800 calories. 

Im not really sure where I can make a change to help me get over this 185 hump. Do I adjust my calories on days when I work doubles to allow for a 4th meal, then trim down on days off, or should I only aim for 3 meals and deal with the acid reflux? Is it okay to stagger my calorie counts daily or should I be aiming for something more steady? 

Any advice is appreciated."
"Curb hunger/ drinking weight Hello, hope you are all well :) 
Last year, before I started drinking, I only weighed about 102~106 lbs since I fluctuated between that a lot. However, during quarantine I started drinking hard kombucha almost everyday and eating quite a bit more than usual, probably around 1600-1800 calories. I’m now about 125 lbs and wish to go back to my normal weight so I cut the drinking cold turkey, I’ve been clean for about a month if not more, how long does it take for metabolism to go back to normal? Plus how to I curb my appetite a bit more? For some reason I’m always hungry now and I don’t know why... I was never like this before. I am eating about 1200-1400 calories a day now if I remember to track it and doing some light exercise on the side since I’m a bit busy with work and school. Any tips in regards to curbing appetite and the metabolism after drinking?
Edit- forgot to add, I eat relatively healthy already, no soda/ sugary drinks, mainly water and sparkling water like la croix, no meat except salmon, shrimp, and egg whites, stay away from dairy, mainly organic/non gmo or limited ingredients :-)"
"how to loose weight at 15 years old i'm 15, i will be turning 16 in just over a month, i walk my grandmom's dog 5 days a week and i walk him for 1 mile 40% hilly 60% flat. with my family its not like we have planned meals every day so its just whatever we have, sometimes we make a planned meal but not too often it happens, so i'm not able to  calculate how many calories/day i have. we also don't have a scale so i do not know how much i weigh, but i am fat, and i've learned to embrace that. what i'm wondering is if anyone has any small idea's or tips to try and loose weight. i don't drink pop, and i only have candy once in a while, although i do still snack a fair bit daily. my weight does not interfere with what i do daily, but i don't like feeling fat."
"moving away from a terribly sedentary lifestyle this winter i've hardly gone anywhere or done anything and it's pretty shocking how little i move.  i've been focusing the last two years or so on my diet, basically learning to cook, eat real foods and managing grocery bills, but haven't made any real effort to get more active.  i mean, consistently active, not just going for a bike ride on a nice summer day and then doing nothing.  also, yoga's great and everything but it isn't really cutting it.  this winter, my lack of movement has been so bad, my bowels are feeling it and i've been constipated on and off for months.  just walking hasn't been enough to work that out.  even if i walk an hour or so, i'm still sitting around the rest of the day.

in an effort to move more, i decided to try one of those aerobics workout videos.  i've wanted to try them for a while now but i've always felt kind of self-conscious (in my own home even) about the idea.  timing my first try for when i knew i'd be home alone, i gave one a shot.  two things immediately struck me: 1) i am slow AF 2) i'm so sedentary it feels weird to move.  just throwing a punch was like the most alien move.  so many movements were just awkward and unsteady.  and they move fast, i never realized my pace was so slow! 

the exercises may look easy and most of them are, but doing them at a really fast pace is sort of the key.  let me tell you, i felt it the next day, but pushed through it again.  my body adjusted quick and it's also pretty great just to move with more strength and balance, which brings me to the third thing that struck me: this is great!  i've always hated aerobic exercise because it's mostly high impact.  running, jogging, jumping rope, great exercise but all killers on your joints.  i've been heavy my whole life, so that's always been a problem for me.  also, these workouts are exactly the right pace.  they do me in every time, but i can still do them daily.  

finally, glad to say i'll be getting back to work and starting a new, physical and pretty fast-paced job next week.  it'll be killer to be on my feet all day again, and i know it's going to be a really rough first week or so but i need it!

these are the aerobics workouts i've been doing and i highly recommend them!  it's a great youtube channel all 'round and there are tons of other routines besides these couple i'll suggest.

"Has there ever been a point along your journey (especially early on) where you just sort of knew that THIS was the time you would finally succeed? What changed for you mentally from all the other times? Ok so basically what I mean to say is, for those who have been “on a diet” for most of their teen/adult lives but never seemed to fall through in the long run, what is it about this time that you’re certain is going to be successful? Whether you’re currently losing weight or have already accomplished your goals, was there, or has there ever been, a moment where it all sort of just clicked and you finally realized that success was in your grasp?

I’m asking because I’m the yo-yo girl. I’ve struggled with EDs from the age of 10, I am a frequent dieter in my adult life, and I have a history of crash landing into months-long periods of binge eating. In January of 2019 I finally admitted I had a problem and I decided to seek out therapy for my tumultuous relationship with food. In the last 2 years I have lost 30lbs which is a drop in the ocean compared to what I want to lose but I feel those 30lbs have taught me valuable lessons. 

This January I took those lessons and decided to get serious about weight loss and I’m down 11lbs in 2 months, which is great! Everyday is less an exercise in restraint and more of a practice in forgiveness. I no longer punish myself for eating a burger every once in a while. The difference is that because I no longer see burgers as “evil” I can now stop at eating 1 of them and I move on to the next meal with no guilt attached. My guilt used to fuel my binge eating and now it’s gone. I’m also able to calorie count for the first time in my life without triggering the ED I had as a child/teen. 

This switch in my mentality towards food and my body has led me to believe that this is “it”. This is finally the moment I’ve been yearning for my whole life. I feel like I’m finally going to succeed at the one thing I’ve failed time and time again. But that’s the thing, I’ve failed countless times and my confidence cripples when I remember all the times I’ve gassed myself up in the past to only fall on my face a few weeks later. 

So yeah! Basically just wondering how many here just “knew” and how true did you believe that to be/did it prove to be true in the end? What conditions led you to decide this? I’m still relatively early on in my own course and I am just curious if this feeling is universal or not and does it mean anything substantial. Because I really feel like this time is different."
"I’m not happy with my body and I’m wondering if I can change things So I’ll start off by saying I’ve gained a significant amount of weight in the last 4/5 years. I’ve been skinny my whole life. Partially bc of genetics, also bc of my athletic lifestyle up until about 18. My depression, laziness and puberty led me to weight gain. I basically messed up my metabolism. I’d consider myself fat for sure at this point and it’s really depressing. I have some stretch marks on my stomach now, my thighs &amp; my shoulder neck &amp; chin area are noticeably bigger.

I’ve lost some weight recently due to eating better and moving around again. I joined the gym today actually. Growing up, I was skinny from the front &amp; the sideview. My waist was naturally small especially from the side view, &amp; it used to go inward too (hourglass).  

But now.... I’m bigger from the side! Even with losing a few pounds I’ve noticed I look smaller looking straight on but when I turn to the side my torso is like 2 times the size it used to be! I cried over it lol what can I do to make it smaller?? I’m in a calorie deficit &amp; I’m trying to stay consistent w working out. But anything extra? And is there anything I can do to get my hourglass figure back? like that indent? 

Also, is it possible to make my arms shoulders!!! &amp; the back of my neck small &amp; skinny again? They’re like huge now.
 It’s embarrassing. Not to say it’s bad on everyone but It just doesn’t fit my frame. Do I just need to lose fat or am I screwed? And can I get my chin to be smaller? Get my legs skinny again?

And what can I do about the stretch marks on my belly? Will they go away with weight loss or get worse? 

Lots of questions, I know. but any information is deeply appreciated!!

edit: I’ve heard many times that you can’t spot reduce but a girl could dream lmao"
"It’s not much, but it’s all mine! [Twenty pounds down, and I can hardly believe it!](https://imgur.com/a/C9bQbZF) I put on my goal jeans this morning, and not only did they zip (!!) but I left them on and actually wore them!

I’ve been doing CICO - but mostly just “CI.” MFP tells me that if I eat around 1600 calories I’ll lose 1 pound per week, so I’ve been using that as my upper limit and aiming for 1200-1300 per day. Any exercise I do is just bonus, I don’t adjust my intake from it but I haven’t been doing tons of exercise yet - that will be Phase 2. 

I recently had a 3 week plateau going on which was super frustrating since I was within 3 pounds of my first goal! But I rode it out, just kept doing what I needed to do and trusted that it would pass eventually. It really helped that people post their weight loss graphs here because I was able to see that everybody has those random upticks, and eventually they head back down again. Hopefully my graph will help someone else! 

If you’re in a plateau, just stay the course. Ride it out and trust the process!"
"Caloric Deficit starting to confuse me I’ve been working out for quite a few years, and cut down for summer seasons about 3 or 4 years in a row now. I’ve always done the basic method of multiplying BW by 15 to get maintenance calories then subtracting 500 for my deficit numbers, but now I’m wondering if the BMR/TDEE method is more accurate and I’ve been cutting too much??

For example, my current BW is 165lbs. Using the simple method with moderate activity levels gets me a 2,475 caloric maintenance with a 1,975 caloric deficit. Whereas using the TDEE  method gives me a BMR @ 1,700 (I’m a 24year old male 5’7”) and using the moderate numbers 1700x1.55 gives me a TDEE of 2,635. Thus making my caloric deficit 2,371.5 if I multiply by 0.9.

That’s almost a 400 calorie difference so my question is, does that gap matter and if so, what number would be the best to cut from? Or am I calculating this incorrectly? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"
"Milestone in my success So I decided in January that I was going to change my lifestyle. Not diet, but like just change how I eat and my activity level. I (22f) started at 213 lbs in January 3, 2021. For the first month I was really just going on daily walks and counting my calories. In February I started incorporating work out videos and eventually got a gym membership. I try to only weight myself once every 7-10 days so I don’t get discouraged. But when I weighed myself today I was down to 193. I’ve lost 20 lbs! It feels so good. I have struggled with gaining weight and my diets never stick. I have a long way to go till my goal weight, but I’m feeling so much better and my clothes are starting to get a little looser!"
"I don't have cheat days anymore. Hey /r/loseit, it's been 7 weeks of CICO (for the second time in four years) and my BMI has fallen from 41 to 38! I want to share an insight I had recently:

There are no more ""cheat"" days. When you have a ""cheat"" day, the only person you are hurting is yourself. If you are wanting to eat a little more but still remain at a deficit, add a few hundred calories without going over. As a very short woman, my body at my ideal weight needs only about 1500 calories per day. Right now, I am eating at 1200 calories per day to lose weight. At my target weight,\* I need only about 1500 calories. So on a day where I am craving a little more peanut butter or almonds, I'll add no more than 300 calories of it.

I want to hit my goals. And I will do it as long as I am honest with myself.

\* I am aware my target weight still puts me in the overweight category. My ideal weight is 96-118 lb according to Asian BMI standards, but I have to get over the mental hurdle of ""at 120 lb someone can pick me up and throw me"" before I want to get there D:"
"Tips for binge eating while attempting to lose fat? Hello!A little backstory to elaborate: I suffered from binge eating, practically since I was 12. I've always had an odd relationship to food, where I never felt full. I was never severely obese (perhaps on the verge, according to my BMI). Last year I dropped 17kg (due to horrible anxiety -- yes I have a diagnosis), then gained 9kg back after drinking a lot with friends, once I moved back home from my studies. For the first time in my life I've felt motivated to actually make a HEALTHY change. Not to try out these crazy diets for ""rapid weight loss"". I just joined a gym, and I'm loving it! I love the soreness, the feeling of being genuinely and physically tired so I can sleep at night. My only issue is sticking to eating healthy, so I can actually lose fat. I am a huge lover of sweets, and think it's hard to control myself around not buying any.

My main goal is to drop in fat so I can be around 20% (I believe I'm around 29% - but need to use a proper device for an accurate result). I also have a goal of attaining a HEALTHY relationship to food. I'd say I've made progress by not binge eating like I used to. Sure, I'll have ""bad"" days where I indulge by eating crap. Or simply over eating, but not actually bingeing for comfort. What I want to know, for a ""full recovery"", is how do/did you drop in fat without having compulsions to over eat sweets/unhealthy foods? I'd love to hear about any experiences and tips!"
"My experience with weight loss and plateaus I (27 year old male) started weight loss a couple years ago at 220 lbs, 5’11. I acordioned a few times until my most recent attempt starting at 195. I’m down to 175 on my way to 155, and I want to speak to those experiencing plateaus.

Plateaus are that tedious, disheartening phase when the scale will not budge. You’re keeping to the calorie count and everything! Why won’t it go down? This question is what I want to answer.

When you keep a calorie deficit, your body is burning fat or muscle. It has to. So why won’t the weight go down? Because your body is also holding on to a bunch of water. What happened with me was almost like clock work. I would keep a deficit, the scale stayed put, until one day I had to pee like CRAZY. Your plateau could just be your body getting ready to piss out LITERAL POUNDS OF WATER. I know it sucks to not see the scale number moving, but know that your fat is being burned if you’re keeping a deficit! That water is gonna come off soon, since there’s less fat to hold it in! The scale number is gonna move in time!

As a minor post-script, this anecdote assumes you are like me and barely workout. Muscles can change the entire weight calculus. But again, whatever the scale says, if the calorie balance is in a deficit, your body is burning at least some fat!"
"Getting back into exercising... Can I just say how incredibly hard it is to ""get back into exercising."" I've made a point to try and walk at least five days the last two weeks, and I've done it, but damnit if it isn't hard trying not to convince myself otherwise. Whether it be that it's too cold, too rainy, or just not good enough outside, my ability to convince myself that sitting on my butt at home is better than walking. But, I have to admit, the endorphins afterwards are worth it. I forgot how good it feels to get moving. The last year has been hard on everyone, and gaining 15 lbs has really pushed me to want to lose it again. Does anyone else feel the need to get motivated in the spring? I feel like this is always the time in which I tell myself ""it's time to do something about it"" and I finally kick my ass into gear and get it done."
"Down 10lbs in a month! Just wanted to share some success. Like many, I put on a lot of weight in the last year. But I was also fat before that, due to binge drinking in college. I put on probably 40lbs in college, and another 30 last year. 

So I finally got my shit together. I got a stationary bike a few months ago and used it intermittently for a while. In mid-Jan I started to get serious with it. My GF got a scale about a month ago and I clocked in at 270lbs (I'm 6'2, so I look big, but not huge). That was a reality check for me. Since then, I cut the drinking way down. I could still do some more work on the drinking, but I'm comfortable with where I'm at. We have also started eating a lot healthier, and less food. We went from a full meal of take out multiple times a week to cooking healthy meals and eating decent portions. I also adjusted my breakfast and lunch intake, usually a yogurt, apple, and protein bar for breakfast and then a portion of leftovers or a turkey sandwich and some carrots with hummus or the like. 

For the bike, I aim for at least 40 mins every day except Fri/Sat. I turn on a show and go. When I started out I barely had the stamina to stand while biking for 1 min. Thursday, I hit 25 minutes of straight standing while biking. I try to keep my heart rate above 140 bpm. 

I'm down to almost exactly 260lbs as of this morning. I reckon I was somewhere around 275 before we got the scale but I won't count it. My face is starting to look thinner. Goal weight is about 210lbs which will put me to my sophomore year of college weight. I was at 185lbs at one point, but looking back, I felt like I was too skinny. I don't like how I looked haha. I liked my size at 210, so I'm aiming to get there within the next year."
"30 Day Accountability Challenge - Day 6 Hello losers,

Happy Saturday! I'm posting earlier than usual because I may not have time later. I hope you're kicking butt!

Weigh in daily, enter in Libra &amp; report here even if I don’t like it: 230.4 this morning, 231.1 lbs trend weight. Heeeey guess who has a uterus in full-fledged violent coup? This lady.

Stay within calorie range (1800): This week has been a bit of a mess kids. I'm maintaining because of my crazy high activity level but I want to get back to a deficit again. Next week will be better. Right after my partner's birthday which will also be a maintenance day. Le sigh. 2/2 days.

Exercise 5 days a week: Vigorous cleaning &amp; stationary bike. 6/6 days.

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, nonfood rewards): Quiet time! And tonight, featuring hair &amp; face mask, possibly a bubble bath. 

Try a new recipe once a week: Romanesco, roasted. New veggie, new recipe, I say it counts even though it tasted like a fun broccoli cauliflower love child. 1/4 weeks.

Express mindfulness and or gratitude: Today I’m grateful for some alone time. In these quarentimes, introverts every where suffering from never actually alone-itis, I feel you. I am you. We're gonna make it, one noise canceling ear bud at a time.

Your turn kids!"
"Bought lose it premium and now I’m motivated. Synced my DNA to it as well! I just finished day one. I have gained 60lbs since the pandemic began. I was in pretty good shape at 6’3 210 going to the gym every day. Life has changed a lot since but also not. 

My DNA results told me I’d benefit from a low fat diet. I’ve never paid too much attention to fat, only protein and carbs! I got right in the recommended range today. My appetite felt good, I drank a ton of water and tracked it. I recorded all of my food. I got 1700 calories with 30 minutes of walking. I don’t feel starved or filled with cravings much at all. This is a good feeling.

I really want to get into the 100s and even a BMI of 21. I think that’d be really neat. 

I am almost impressed by how big I have gotten. It’s over now, though. My waist was measured at 49”! Normally it’s about 35”! My goal is 30”. 😌

Foods I am eating:

Egg whites

35 whole wheat bread

Chicken (battered in egg whites with coconut flour and air fried)

Fish (eggs whites with coconut flour and air fried)

Peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes 

Salads

Italian dressing, low fat ranch, Buffalo sauce

Smoothies

Fruits &amp; 100%juices

Cauliflower Rice

Coffee w/ soy or almond milk 


I may need to add more variety of protein sources. Any advice to keep my diet fun and delicious, let me know your go tos.


Stay feeling cute 💅🏻👑"
"Help with motivation and less than ideal circumstances so a few years ago I (5""7) weighed 101kg. I hated how I looked I hated how I felt so I made a change in my diet, lots of logging on mfp etc and got down to about 77kg.

Now here are the problems. I have bipolar disorder, pretty badly to the extent that I can't work. If I'm in a really good period and I'm lucky I can be stable for a while and actually look after myself, when I'm not... a lot less so. The medications I take tanked my thyroid so I'm on thyroid replacement medication and alllll of my meds have weight gain as a side effect. The deck is pretty stacked. Right now at least I consider it a good day if I get dressed and don't actively wish to drop down dead.

I just don't know how to motivate myself when an episode can set me back, the last I weighed myself I was back up to 94kg, I lost nearly all the progress I made before. It's hard to log my meals when I can barely get the energy to cook, let alone weigh and portion things as I go. It's hard to make myself workout when I can't even get dressed and leave the house like nine times out of ten. 

I don't want to be fat, I know it makes things worse, I know it makes me feel worse about myself but like... jesus what the hell am I supposed to do here? Everything feels pointless and I can't be consistent with anything because my brain chemistry hates me.

Is there anyone here in a similar boat that has any advice? Everything is so hard."
"View calorie tracking apps as magic. This is something I mentioned on here before.  But it really helps to get over the hump with calorie tracking as viewing them less as a mathmatcial harsh reality and more as a MAGIC thing to believe in (or a conspiracy, or whatever floats your personal boat).

If someone told you that there was just an app that if you opened for 5 minutes a day, and you magically just lose weight, who wouldn't use it?  

It's some silly thing that I dont know why it even works but holy shit the phone just sucks my fat out with this magical app!  I only use the camera a bit and answer a few questions, no more than 5 minutes in any day!  Less than one week in and I'm 5 pounds down!

Seriously pretend it's some infomercial on late night TV, don't overthink it, and enjoy the results."
"I only ate 4 cookies! This is probably not a big deal to most people, but I have a huge problem with self control. Usually if I bought a pack of 24 break and bake cookies, I would eat more than half in one sitting. 

I stopped buying them for a long time for that reason, but I’ve had a really strong craving for cookies. So I bought a pack, and instead of making the whole thing, I only made half (12 cookies). 

I am proud to say that I only ate 4! I immediately wrapped up 8 cookies before eating any of them and afterwards, I didn’t feel fat and disgusting like I would if I binged all of them. 

A very small victory but I am very proud of this accomplishment. Now I know I can have treats now and then without feeling deprived, and I won’t binge them in one sitting.

EDIT: I can’t believe the responses to this! Thank you all so much for the kind words. I’ve cried a lot reading through them. You are all very beautiful people and I am more motivated than ever now!"
"Metformin and Antipsychotics Hey Guys.

Curious if anyone taking antipsychotic medication long term has had success cutting weight by including metformin in their days.

My reason for asking Im a 6'6"" 375 pound guy. I take an injectable form of resperidone (150mg) and ever since I started taking it back in 2012 I have put on 110 pounds. I since christmas have lost around 10 pounds but yhen plateaued. When I hit the plateau I commited to trying to lose the weight so did 2 weeks of solid cico 1500-2000 calories, hiking 5km (@375pounds), fasting and only eating between 5-9pm and the scales maybe budged a pound. As part of my regular bloodwork being on invega sustena I get bloodwork and my hemoglobin A1C was above normal.

Wondering if anyone else has had similar problems and if metformin has helped them lose more weight using sugars more effectively."
"Losing weight and cholesterol Hello, 26F here, I recently got my blood work done.
My cholesterol is 220.
LDL- 145.6
HDL-59.7
Triglycerides-91.5

 I am wondering what exactly in my diet is effecting it.
I am overweight. I am losing weight. Down from 216 to 167lb.
I have 2 eggs daily. I reach my daily limit of cholesterol automatically, so everything is an add on and hence a higher value.
Milk, I have around 0.5 cup daily.
Bread, I usually eat whole wheat bread and sometimes whit too. Not more than 2 slices daily. I did add butter to it, 1 tsp.
I don't eat that much of biscuits, cakes. It's an indulgence that I'll also need to cut, including pizza😭 

I do have fried foods in my diet. But they are made in veg oil. Isn't cholesterol effected by trans and saturated fat? Isn't veg oil none of the above? I am extremely confused here.
Most of the oil I use in cooking is olive oil.

So if reduce my daily egg intake, cut out butter, mayo, cheese, milk, potato. It's should work. The fried food and thing is something I need help with. 

I am a bit scared because I don't wanna die. I am hoping once i am in the ideal weight range, that should help. I have been obese for so long. This is the first time in approx 8 years that I have been in the overweight category. I am hoping to go lower in a few month.

I am hoping these changes will ofcourse help the weight loss too.
What do I need to cut?"
"SV/NSV successfully maintained for months! I took a three month (unplanned) break from CICO around December, and I’m just now back on the wagon - tracking calories, weighing myself, measuring. I’m beaming because I’m that 3-4 months of not really thinking about it, I maintained my lower weight! (225 &gt; 200) 

I’ve been trying to think about why that worked. To be sure, it never has before. I would lose weight, and right when I stopped thinking about it, I’d shoot back up. But finally (finally!) I’m actually committed to making a lifestyle change and maintaining healthier habits. My default habits are now just healthier and more sustainable than they were before! 

Some examples of things I changed; I eat vegetables a ton more now (and I have fun trying to cook them in interesting ways), I don’t snack at night (lights out means the fridge stays closed), and I stop eating before I’m full. I did, however, still have occasional takeout, bake (and eat) treats, and drink. I just balanced it out much more than I had ever learned to before. 

Very happy with myself!! Excited to move forward and see where I go in a few more months. Do you guys feel the same about these more abstract personal / habit changes as you do the tangible scale changes?"
Losing weight is hard. Watching what you eat is hard. Being fat is hard. Hating yourself is hard. Assuming other people hate you is hard. Feeling you don't deserve to take up space is hard.

Having to wear a uniform at work that you don't feel confident in because you're self-conscious about your body is hard. Having to share the backseat of a car with three people is hard. Being too embarrassed to go to the doctor or not being taken seriously by a medical professional is hard. Not feeling desirable or wanted is hard. Feeling you have to monitor how you hold your body at all times even in your own home is hard. Feeling your body isn't capable of doing strong things like lifting and exercise is hard. Having your thighs burn from chub rub when you do try to exercise or if you forget to apply deodorant when you wear a dress is hard. Feeling like you can't look good in a simple t-shirt and jeans is hard. Dreading walking up stairs or breathing too heavy is hard.

"Second day over calories and accountability Female, (19) 5”4. SW: 157lbs (71.2kg) CW: 119.4lbs (54.2kg) GW: 112lbs (50.8kg) 

I eat 1200 calories a day but the weight hasn’t been moving at all recently. I ate 1550 cals yesterday and 2130 today. I wasn’t too concerned with yesterday’s calories but the lack of self-control I had today has worried me in case I can’t reign it back in tomorrow either :(

I need to try and hold myself accountable so to get back on track otherwise I feel like I’ll ruin all my progress and I never want to go back to the weight I started at. It’s just a bit of a panic that I’ll ruin things if I carry on, even though it’s only been 2 days off track. 

So here’s to holding myself accountable🤞🏼"
"Sanity check re: inaccurate scale So my first Reddit post; be gentle. Pandemic, stress, late-night snackage, etc. - I hit 208 in September '20. As a short woman in my 50s this is not a good place, so I downloaded loseit and set a step goal and was kind of embarrassed to find that eating less calories than you burn well, you know. I set a goal of 160 and as of today I'm at 175, feel a million times better, don't feel deprived, and feel this is sustainable. 

Howsomever - the scale I used at the start is an old school type dial scale that might be almost as old as I am, and I think it's about 3-5 pounds off - i.e, I probably started at 213 and am now 180. I've got a digital scale now and comparing weight on the two I think my old monster is accurate enough when it comes to pounds lost (or gained) - If I'm down a pound or two on one I'm done a pound or two on the another. Eventually I'd like to have an accurate measurement, and I know I could just reset my goal using the digital weight - but I just have this thing about using the same scale at least to get to my first goal of ""160 which is really 165,"", and then for subsequent smaller goals (I'd like to get to 145 eventually) just go ahead and reset and use the digital then - it won't bug me to go ""up"" 5 lbs. 

Good psychological workaround, self-deceptive fatlogic, doesn't really matter in the long run?  Would appreciate anyone's take!"
"Is it time to stop keto? Hey y’all, I know this isn’t the keto subreddit but I’d like opinions from everyone! I’m 22F 5’ 4” SW: 257 CW: 205 GW:175, started September 1st now here we are! I work out a lot and make sure to be in a calorie deficit, on average I eat 1200 calories a day and burn a total 3,000 a day. I no longer have cravings, and honestly I’m never really hungry, however tired a lot of the time (cuz of the low carb intake). I drink a ton of water, make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep, drink at least one cup of green tea a day, and do not snack after dinner. I’ve loved being keto these past 6 months, it has definitely kick started my journey and gotten me in the right “weight loss mindset”. However, since this year has started, I have only lost 6 pounds, despite all my efforts (large deficit and working out 5 days a week for 90 minutes). I’ve spoken to many friends/family about this matter, since you all know, working your ass off and not seeing results is a huge bummer. MANY have suggested to stop doing keto, and I’m having a hard time accepting it. I am so proud of myself for overcoming my addiction to food/emotional eating, I don’t think I could have done it without keto. Not to toot my own horn at all, but I know many people have a hard time sticking to low carb, so the fact that I have maintained it for over 6 months makes me feel like it’s a skill of mine I shouldn’t give up on! I am so happy that I love going to the gym, so happy that I wake up excited to weigh myself, so happy with the way I look, and so so happy that I do not feel chained to junk food anymore. I love my current mindset so much I don’t want to lose it, thats why I’m scared of transitioning off keto :( I do plan to stay in a deficit if I do stop keto, not to say I plan on giving up my journey all together lol. If anyone else has been/is in the same situation as me please let me know. I’m planning on speaking to a nutritionist very soon, but I’d love to hear from people in this community as well!!"
"Im tired of saying tomorrow I used to be a skinny kid throughout highschool, I used to be fat/chubby in middle school and then decided to do something about it. It was easier to lose the weight back then. Now im 24 years old, I went through a rough patch in my life for a good 3 years so I gained a lot of weight, more than I ever did in my entire life, went from being 180 to 220. AS mentioned before, went through a rough patch so a lot of it was due to drinking, after successfully quitting, I noticed I switched to eating and Im wondering what are good ways to find healthier options for snacks? I dont tend to be a snacker, but when I do it's just junk food and Ive been eating a lot of fastfood lately,so Im cutting that as well.

tl;dr: Wondering what are healthy snacks and great workouts that dont involve weights."

I work there alone, i open and close by myself. And its only busy around lunch time then rest of the day no one is there watching me so i end up eating a lot of the food we make (its so good. But the sauces are so fatty, its based on mayonnaise). I eat cuz I get hungry but also cuz im bored and no one is watching.

I do eat breakfast before work and a good healthy high protein filling one. But then i work from like 10am till 7pm and end up eating so much. And then i get home and eat a snack again before bed.

How do I control what I eat at work?😖 its the only thing holding me back from reaching my goals."
"Seems like I've gained a little fat while trying to cut? I started my diet and cut back in the beginning of February because of some bad weight I gained during this quarantine. I am 19 yrs old, 5""11and sitting at around 155lbs, my goal is just to trim down on the fat a bit before I get back to the gym to lean bulk. 

Recently thought, I've noticed that my belly seems to be slightly more bloated aswell as a bit more facial fat these past 2 weeks. Not sure what I'm doing wrong I've cut down before but this is the first time I'm eating a healthy amount of calories (had some weight issues before). At one point on the right and left upper sides of my stomach region I could see a slight ab outline but it may have been because of my ab workouts rather than fat loss.

I'm eating at around 1,800-2,000 cals per day, eating mainly protein but making sure I get a healthy amount of carbs and fats. I do HIIT training 3 days a week and jump rope the other days with the weekend being my rest days. 

Any help is very appreciated."
"A busy student who needs to lose weight desperately I'm a busy student currently preparing for college admissions this year. Recently, with Covid and the stay-at-home status, my weight has increased drastically. I've been overweight since a child but I've been noticing my weight gains recently. I'm constantly at the computer doing work, essays, college preparation and etc. Combining that with my naturally lazy lifestyle, I've been leading a sedentary lifestyle for the past 4 months. (Usually, at school, I go to racket club and do a good hour of playing twice a week but I'm not able to at the moment.)

Also, another problem is that I'm a food lover and I find it difficult saying ""no"" to food when it's offered to me. So, even when I'm not that hungry, I'll eat anything if offered. I know this is bad but food is a real kryptonite to me. (Shame that my love for food didn't come with lightning-fast metabolism...)

My questions are:

1. What are some good workout regimes/routines for busy people? (10-40 mins available)
2. Any other food lovers here, who can give any tips on reducing appetite or something similar?
3. Are there any good foods that help reducing weight? Any meal plans you had success with?
4. Any other general tips for a newbie to weight loss?

Thanks in advance, everyone!"
"Feel like I failed myself and now I will never get to the weight I want because of stretch marks. Hey y’all, just wanted to make this post to get some stuff off my chest and maybe see if anyone else has been or currently in the same situation. 
      I’m a 22 male and weight about 280. Just like most people I gained a ton of weight during 2020. I keep 
seeing old pictures of myself on Snapchat from memories and just get depressed on how my body used to look compared to now. I have gotten stretch marks all over my body and quite ashamed that I let myself get to this point. I keep thinking to myself that even if I get back to the weight I was before or my goal weight in total that I will still have stretch marks and it will always be a reminder on how I failed. Yes I know they will eventually fade over time but still. I also feel like once I start dating again once the pandemic has gotten under control and more people are vaccinated that I won’t feel comfortable taking my shirt off just because of these stretch marks, even if I do lose weight. Anyone else have ever felt like this after gaining and losing weight."
"Starting My Wellness Journey (Long Post) So all my adult life I have struggled with my weight.  I love to eat and I hate really doing a lot of working out.  I did get down at one point 7 years ago to 180 but have been going back up ever since.  The last four months have been a text book in inactivity.  The weather was cold, rained and snowed a lot, I fell into deep depression.  I spent my time eating junk and reading comics and playing video games and using every excuse in the world I could find not to exercise.  it has effected my physical health as well as my mental health.  I was talking to my therapist and she asked me why if I took such steps towards improving my metal health why I did nothing for my physical health.  I sat long and hard and the only answer I could think of was because I am lazy.  I have no physical condition that will keep me from working out other then being overweight and getting tired.  I decided that ends as of now.

I talked to my primary care doctor and we had a long appointment where we came up with some things do to to help me stay active.  One thing when I am feeling upset I pace.  So he said i need to turn that into walking.  He said if I start small with things that I dont hate like the walking that will be a good start.  He also talked about a little light jogging.  We then talked about my diet and I wont even get into that.  but we found some healthy foods and meals plans that I am comftable with.  

I have a large area in my yard that I can walk  laps in and the ground is even so I can do some jogging also.  I have a hard time leaving the house and being in public so parks are not the greatest for me.  I also have an area on my back porch for Jumping Jacks.  My mother is also helping.  She got me a fit bit to keep track of my walking.  I am also going to drink water of soda and sugar drinks and thanks to the fit bit app can keep track of how much I drink.  I set a goal of how much I want to walk each day.  I loaded my mp3 player with tons of music to listen to.  my mother is also going to call me several times a day to make sure I am not being lazy.  I have a set time that I will not be playing video games.  Like I said no games between 9am and 6pm and I put a limit on how many comics I can read a day.  On rainy days I can walk in my house.  I live in a trailer so there is a pretty straight shot that I can walk back and forth in.  Just really anything to keep me out of my room and off my butt.

As of today 3-6-21 I weigh 301 pounds.  I have not set a target weight as I do not want to be disappointed if I do not get to it.  

I know this will be hard because I really love just being lazy, playing games, reading comics and watching tv.  

Does anyone maybe have any advice on how to stay motivated?  Like how did you go from lazy to active?

Thank you all for reading :)"
"Advice? Hello, around summer 2020 I weighed 200 pounds, I managed to get to mid 170s and plateaued at 177. However, the new low weight reduced my “worry” of being fat. As such, my efforts to be disciplined slightly reduced. I was a bit looser with my restrictions. During the holiday break, after my first semester of school completed, i tired to enjoy myself despite the lockdown. I guess the lack of going out and socializing demotivated me to some extent. So during the holidays I enjoyed myself because “it’s the holidays”. I gained weight and went to the low 180s. Which I thought was fine, I can easily come back down. But I guess one thing led to another, and the further restrictions impacted my mental health (?). I just slowly became less disciplined. Some days I didn’t track, some days I’d track but willingly went over. Now I’m at 193 lbs. Feeling a bit hopeless with myself, and would love some advice regarding this. How do I snap out of it and jump back in it. I suspect the warmer days is what made it easier to go for walks and stay active. The gyms are closed. I bought an exercise bike - but not motivated like before to get moving. Despite the cold I could try to go on walks still. Any advice would be great!"
"losing weight to fast? hi everyone been a little while since i posted, my first post was asking how long it would take to lose 36kg back in Nov 14 2020 when i was 136kg, now its 7 March 2021 and im 115kg, i knew i was losing weight i just wasn't sure how fast till yesterday when i did a little math and realized i lost 21kg in only 3.7 months and realized that just to fast.  


I am on a calorie deficit  i try to maintain 1800 calories and i exercise 3-4 days a week for 1 hr on 2-3 days and on a Tuesday is when i go for a walk and lately iv been walking for 1-2hours and up to 10-13km.  


I want to slow it down and i guess the question is how many calories should i consume to slow it down im 174cm 22 almost 23"
"Why are bad days always so bad? M: 36, SW: 370 CW: 336, GW: 220

I've been going through a weight loss journey since 2014. At my highest, 370. At my lowest, 240. I gained it all back from a series of increasingly bad life decisions, and now I'm back to trying to lose it.

I go and do well for weeks at a time.  Most recently I got down to 328.  I was super proud.  I finally broke the 330 plateau I was on.  Then I had a covid scare at work, had some real problems with a boss, and binged one day. ONE day.  I woke up the next morning, I had gone from 328 to 334 in one bad day decision. I thought, OK, it was one bad day, there's some water weight, it'll go back down. And here I am a week later, 336. 

Why is it SO hard to get this stupid number to go down, but SO FRICKIN EASY to get it to go back up? It's infuriating and frustrating and flustering."
"Calorie Tracking: Handy Dandy Spreadsheet There are a million and one ways to track calories. Dozens of apps, all kinda things. I've personally found using a google spreadsheet really useful, as I can program it to track things in different ways, and I can access it from both my phone and computer

. I've got one column to track my daily weight, and at the end of each week it averages my weight for the week. One that tracks the day of the week, and the total days in the cycle (this particular sheet is a 12 week sheet). The next totals the calories for the day, and then averages the calories for that week.

When you eat something, just put the calories in the next 'Food' column for that day, and it will automatically add it to your total for that day, as well as calculate its number into your average for the week. If you weigh yourself every day, put that into the 'Current Weight' column, and it will average your weight for the week. This is to give more of an overall weight trend as opposed to once a week weighing, which can fluctuate a bit much.

Because weight loss is a long process, people (myself included) can get lost in the minutia of the day to day. Using the spreadsheet has really helped me to put things into big picture perspective. And because it's helping me, I figured maybe it might help someone else, so I made a blank copy to share with you guys. If you want to make a copy, just go to File, and then 'Make a Copy'.

There's also a couple spots at the top for your Starting Weight, Goal Weight, and Goal Calories per day.

"Another post about not losing it as fast as possible. When you have the epiphany (whether it's for the first time or the sixteenth) that you need to lose weight, you want to lose it fast. Whether it comes from disgust with yourself, fear of health effects, or motivation from posters here who lost massive amounts in relatively short amounts of time. 

If you've been around here and read along a bit, you probably have some numbers or phrases memorized. 

-For the average overweight/obese person, you should lose no more than two pounds per week. 

-Women need a minimum of 1200 calories per day. 

-Men need a minimum of 1500 calories per day. 

-You probably shouldn't eat back your exercise calories, at least not all of them. 

If you go too hard and post about losing 5lbs a week or declare a dry fast or eating 1000 calories a day, you'll probably get some push back. 

I'm here to push back about the other half of this mindset, from my point of view as a relatively short woman who had a medium amount of weight to lose. I have tried to lose multiple times, with the help of this subreddit and /r/1200isplenty. 

1200 isn't plenty or sustainable for every woman, and if you're reading this and getting defensive... It may be enough for you. But if you're constantly hungry, thinking about food, your hair is thinning..those are classic signs you're under fueling. 

But what is even sneakier is what's more likely: while under fueling you'll probably snap one day and slip and eat 2400 calories or more. Maybe it turns into multiple days or even weeks of falling off the wagon. You blame yourself for not being able to stay consistent, for not being strong like the women you seeing constantly eating under 1300 calories. 

If you are moderately active and not super short, you probably need more than 1200 calories. ""But wait!"" you say, ""I need a 1000 calorie daily deficit to lose 2 lbs a week, so I have to eat 1250 or less because I'm working from home!""

Have you considered you don't need to lose 2 lbs a week? 

Just because it's the maximum, the fastest possible, doesn't mean it's on your path. Just because 1200 calories is the minimum doesn't mean you need to do that. 

I've had a lot more success eating 1700-2000 calories a day than 1200-1400, and I have more energy and focus. I also will add that I *am* eating exercise calories back (I need to, I'm running 35 miles a week)! It takes a lot of patience, but I know I've more permanently lost this weight this time. 

Reconsider your relationship with that 2lb a week goal. See if it's right for you!"
"Why does this feel so impossible? From July to December/January, I lost around 15lbs. I even got a little lower — to about 19 — before it all just stopped. Since January, I’ve been fluctuating from about 180-184, and I just can’t seem to get any further.

And what’s frustrating is that it seems to entirely be a willpower and a consistency thing. I’ve hit 10,000 steps (and often far higher) almost every day in these two months, and more recently I’ve been consistently working out in the mornings. I’ve played around with calories — from 1400 to 1700 to 1500 — to figure out what works best, but I just can’t seem to actually *stick* to good eating habits. I get cravings, or I simply feel like eating more, or I just give in to temptation. I can’t make sure I don’t have things in the house, because I live next door to a shop — it’s too easy to go grab anything I want, and plus, I tend to go even worse if I can’t have *some* access to good foods.

I don’t even know if this is an ask for advice or simply a vent. I’m so frustrated with myself, and I don’t know why I just can’t manage to get it together. I’m sick of the way my body is, and I’m so desperate to lose the weight — it’s just disheartening to realise I’ve made no progress whatsoever in the past two months."
"I'm 13 and want to lose weight So I'm 13 5'7 and 210 pounds, I've kinda been overweight or obese basically my whole life except for when I was younger, you guys think eating only 3 meals a day and doing 45 min runs each morning is good? I've seen people use my fitness pal, but the problem here is that my family likes to go out a lot and eat dinner instead or eating or cooking at home, and please don't say I should not worry about this or I'll grow out of it cause please read the top again about me being 13 and 210 pounds, Now about my diet right now, I literally only drink water nothing else, soda was never good to me. I'm just trying to get some tips and guidance rn cause I just wanna be slim, nothing to serious like having a 6 pack of abs."
"Scales What scale does everyone use? I have a fitbit scale that is 6-8 years old, maybe older. I've put together a solid 3 months of habits - exercise, diet, fasting, etc - that should be consistent with weight loss and I can see a physical change in my body. However, my scale gives me drastically different outputs only minutes apart (10-15 lb swings) depending on where I put it on the floor around my house and I've even tried solid ground outside. Sometimes I'll get different readings even if I leave it in the same place and come back to it a couple hours later.  

TLDR: It might be time to replace my old scale, what do you have and do you recommend it? Thanks."
"is this diet causing bad side effects or is it probably something else? a couple days ago I cut my calories kind of drastically (went from averaging 2300/day to like 1800/day) and also increased my exercise (went from around 1.5 hours/day to 2.5 hours/day). according to my watch and calorie counts, I’ve been in a deficit of about 600 (burning 800-1000 calories through exercise). I’ve also been feeling just pretty low energy, tired, weak, and dizzy, but I’m unsure if this is because of this new diet change.

for context, I’m a 5’4F age 19 weighing about 120 lb (I know I don’t need to lose weight medically but that’s not what’s important). these symptoms seem to correlate perfectly with my new diet changes. the only reason I’m questioning this is because I’m a female of average height and I feel that I shouldn’t have all these ill side effects at 1800 a day when some people are thriving off 1200 a day, so what gives? I’m also trying to increase my calories back to where I was before but it’s giving me a ton of anxiety and I just want to know if this diet is most likely causing it or if it’s something else and there’s no point in trying to increase calories and cut down on exercise"
"Motivation Hi everyone. I had a few curiosities on motivation. What keeps you motivated to exercise? To stay in a caloric deficit? Is it the way you look, is it the way you feel? Is it your self-esteem? Do you really enjoy exercising? Is it a combination of goal setting and accomplishment in the gym, in your diet, in your body's progress? I want to know what keeps you motivated, especially on those days when you wake up and seriously do not want to do a single thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be an extremely motivated and confident person a few years ago. I would go the gym everyday, I would run everyday, and I truly really enjoyed those activities. My self-esteem was solidified when I worked out or ran everyday. Now, after a year or two of being overweight my motivation really fluctuates. Some days I am really motivated to run and after my run I feel fantastic. But some days I have no motivation to run or workout which I am pretty sure was never a problem in the past. Let me know your thoughts on what keeps YOU motivated!"
"Nearly 20 pounds down. Stalled So I'm about 3 pounds shy of 20 pounds down. At first the weight flew off. Now I've completely stalled out. I have been hovering at the same weight plus or minus 2 pounds for 2 weeks. I've increased my exercise, tried to lower my stress, been watching what I'm eating. But I don't know how I can breakthrough this dumb plateau I seem to be on. Has this happened to anyone else? What did yall do to get past it?
Originally, since I have a sedentary job, I just focused on my diet. I counted calories and tracked my food. That really seemed to work in the beginning. After about 3 weeks of being on a 1200 calorie a day diet my weight loss slowed. I got an elliptical. I've been using it and hoping the increased activity would help. But I'm still the same. I still have plenty of weight to lose. 
I'm trying to stay away from super calorie dense food and from really fatty meats. I'm thinking about limiting breads next. I don't want to completely exclude a food group because that's not sustainable.  But I'm a little at a loss for what to do. I just keep seeing the same number on the scale. I have a food scale that I use. So I'm not sure how I'm maybe completely underestimating my calories. How can I get through this stall?"
"6 lbs in 14 days.. So a few days back I made a post about how I had only lost 1lb in 8 days, and it felt like a major drag,  well now I am 14 days in and the scale finally seems to be moving.

I started at 283lbs and now sit at 277lbs, ok granted the first 5lbs I always consider water weight , so maybe I have lost only 1lb of fat , but hey its a start at least.

Still have a long way to go, but now I feel like the eating healthy and exercise 4 times a week is starting to finally work.

I am also measuring my waist and belly as I go along and they too have also seem to have gone down an inch(maybe bloating? call me skeptical) , hopefully it starts to steady out though as I do not want to lose too much too fast as I have been down that road before.

I currently eat 1500 cals a week, but I guess, should I wish to slow the rate at what I lose I would probably need to increase my calories somewhat.

It's a case or over coming that mental aspect of maybe eating a bit more calories will be a good thing even though I eat every 3 hours and never feel hungry."
"Strategy: The Lifeguard plan I was in my best shape when I was a lifeguard.  You'd have to start working out and eating well consistently in the spring to get in shape, stay and maintain the shape in the summer, start falling off and back in the fall, and be rather loose and easy by the winter.

I'm formalizing this with myself.  And posting it here to keep me to it. Spring (Mar-May) I'll be working out 4 times a week with strict calorie counting every day, Summer (June to August) I'll be going back to 3 days a week workout with calorie counting or watching but allowed days for friends/family events for going over.  Fall (Sept - Nov) I'll be doing 2 or 3 days a week workout, with more calorie 'watching' kinda just keeping it in the back of the mind but not restricting.  Winter (Dec - Feb) I'll be opening up the beer, sitting back in the bar, I'll be maintaining some light workouts to keep the strength up and not lose all the progress. 

I feel like a lot of plans end up doing similar things.  People that do the January resolution blitz usually end up doing less than this but earlier when it's much harder to workout in cold areas.  Its not dissimilar to bodybuilder's who do cut/bulk cycles.  

What I like about it is that it is just accepting that calorie restricting and heavy workouts are very hard to do for an entire year.  But they do work and are tools for sure especially in short spurts.  This just sets some dates and goals with those tools.  

I'll check back in a few months, but for now I got a jog to go do."
"What healthy “substitutions” or foods (like cauliflower) did you fall in love with? I wanna talk about your favorite healthy substitutions!

As my regular diet has gotten healthier over the years, there’s a few things I started eating for weight loss that I now love:

1. Turkey. Bacon.
Turkey bacon is delicious. It’s not quite as good as the real thing at first, but it’s crispy and meaty and tasty with only 30 calories a slice and less heart disease. Amazing. I’ll have real bacon sometimes if I go to a diner and it’s good, but I love me some turkey bacon.

2. Cauliflower
It’s basic, but there’s a reason it’s so popular and it’s so tasty and easy to add a little veggie into everything and it adds low calories bulk. Amazing.

3. Nonfat Greek Yogurt
I’ve only added this a few times, but it adds such a high protein low calorie creamy quality to things. I don’t know why I don’t buy it more, but every time I use it *chefs kiss*

4. Black coffee
It took me awhile but I love black coffee, especially with hazelnut

A lot of these you have to work to enjoy, but man they’re so amazing when you make the switch. It’s like when you first start eating spicy food.

What are your favorites?"
"Bad day M30, SW: 193; CW: 180, GW: 163

There was a post on here around Christmas/ new years that said “in April there are going to be a lot of transformation pictures and if you want to be part of it you need to start now”.

For some reason that really resonated with me. I started making some changes to my habits and working out with YouTube videos. I cant lie, I also kept imagining myself going back to work after COVID and seeing people’s reactions to the new me.

But then there are fucking days like today. Where My job is more stressful, where the kids cry too much and where my wife is mad at me for pretty random things. And instead of blowing off steam by working out, watching Seinfeld or listening to music, i fucking eat until I feel like vomiting. 

I wish it was only today, but it happened for four days straight two weeks ago. I thought I got my shit together, but now I’m back on bullshit.

I don’t know what to do."
"About exercises that burn calories? I am very new to this. I  havent seen a question like this.   


 I am a male. I am 169 cm long(dont know how many feet but a little more than 5 I think). I weigh 89 kilos (169 pounds).   


I am currently counting calories and also exercising. I am looking for videos that will help me burn calories. I have a difficult time knowing how much calories I am burning with certain videos.   
I have been doing this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml6cT4AZdqI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml6cT4AZdqI)  
and today I did this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi-v4PgOVnQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi-v4PgOVnQ)   
    
I felt that the last one was more intense than the first but I dont know how much calories I burn with each . I want to do the one that burns the most calories. Does anyone know how I can find that out? Is it the intensity or the length of the exercise that decides ?   


Tomorrow I am thinking about doing this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LueYlLt1l9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LueYlLt1l9M) but it doesnt seem as intense as the others but it says that I can burn 500 calories with this one.   


I just wonder how I can know how much calories I have burnt and if every exercise burns the same for every person?   


Thank you"
Help finding a show about weight loss I'm not sure if this is the right or best place to post this but maybe someone can help. Years ago I watched this show about fitness/weight loss that I really enjoyed and I would like to find it and watch more. I believe it was British but I am not sure. It followed 3 people where 1 of them was very skinny and was gaining weight and muscle. Another one was very fit but was too large and he ate like 6k calories per day so he wanted to become smaller. And the 3rd one was also pretty big but he had a lot of fat because he was lifting super heavy weights so he wanted to be more lean. All of them were also introduced to one another and worked out together to help them with their goals and to share the techniques. If anyone can help me find the name of this show I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!
"Vacation weight success... and fail We rented a house with a pool for a week just to catch a break. I have been largely sugar free and have worked out for 30 minutes minimum (usually 60) aince before the start of 2021 and had finally got my hands on a bar weight set before vacation. 

My plan was to indulge a bit, but not wreck myself.

I got sugar free cappuccino mix, my favorite sugar free protein drink, poocorn, and sugar free Russel Stovers. I also cooked all but three meals. I did get two margaritas and a frozen yogurt that had sugar, plus whatever hidden sugar may have been in a burger and diabla tacos.

I walked 30 minutes everyday and did 30 minutes of laps most days.

Still, toward the end of the week, I felt my calves jiggle, my upper stomach looked puffy, and and other unflattering things bikinis reveal. I figure at least I did well to keep exercising and I'll monitor my diet to drop the clearly added weight. 

Except when we got home, I had only gained one pound! I mean, yay! But dammit! I'm half laughing half crying that my perceived gain was just me!"
"Wading into uncharted territory! Hi everyone!

I am a chronic lurker but this sub has really been helpful during the last year. I have been overweight my entire life, compounded with being tall which always gives a complex about being a ""big girl"". In middle school we moved and I really blew up at that point due to depression and anxiety, with my primary coping skill being comfort eating.

When I was a teen I was sent to an outdoors program for almost 2 years. I went in weighing 315 at age 16 and came out at 215 at age 18. However, I immediately started gaining weight the minute I had choices of intake. My heaviest that I actually weighed myself at was 404 pounds in 2015. In 2019, I had a herniated disc that spilled into my spinal canal and compressed the nerve bundle at the end of my spine, paralyzing me from the waist down. My first weigh in after a few years put me at 390 in the hospital. I wish I could say I started making changes then, but that wasn't the case. Luckily, I've regained my ability to walk and am very mobile again.

When COVID hit, I was sitting at home doing my usual binging on take out. One day, I was eating some peanut butter oreos, and polished off the pack during the day. This wasn't anything out of the ordinary or even that much. But somehow, something clicked that day. I thought, ""I can't go on like this, and what do I want to look back at this pandemic time and say I did?"" So I committed to using the Loseit app again.

I'd been on diets since age 11 and I would always go hard for about a month and then slip back to old habits. I never created anything I could sustain. This time, I implemented small changes, a few at a time. The biggest difference was that I started eating healthier. I always just did portion/calorie control but still with junk. I do restricted time windows for eating (11 am - 7 pm), low calorie, macronutrients balance of at least 30% protein and under 100g net carbs, logging EVERYTHING before I put it in my mouth, fiber/sodium monitoring, and very limited sugar. I haven't been perfect and that's ok, but the most foundational piece has been to log no matter what. I have to look at it, whether I have a bad day and eat a ton of pizza, or a good day when I eat super healthy.

At first I was waiting to inevitably fail again, but eventually I realized I have really been able to turn a corner and stay consistent. I'm excited to keep going and reach my final goal. It feels possible and this time is different. I've already been thinking about how to do maintenance successfully and have some plans for that.

"Small, consistent efforts over time. That’s how I got here. How I gained 85 pounds over the past ten years. Starbucks drinks. Disregarding portion sizes. Treats. Eating out. Ice cream for breakfast. Chips “because I need it”. Fried instead of grilled. Empty carbs to fill me up. I could go on forever about the small choices I made every single day that got me to where I am today. I made seemingly small choices that pushed me further and further away from my goals. I am flipping the switch now. I will continue to make small, consistent efforts. Weight loss isn’t magic, I can’t get rid of all this fat overnight because I didn’t gain it overnight. Each moment is an opportunity to move towards my goals or farther away and I am finally ready to make that switch. I am trying to take it minute by minute. Meal by meal. And hopefully 10 years from now I can be proud of all the small, consistent efforts I have made instead of being ashamed."
"Funny how When you’re overweight or obese, NO ONE said anything about your eating habits, food choices, and be concerned about your health. To make it worse, some people just keep throwing their leftovers to you.

But when you are on a diet for health reasons or to be healthier in general, EVERYONE become a dietician and interfere with your diet and telling you, you are ok the way you are and you don’t have to diet. Also, judging your food choices and trying to sabotage it by offering food.

Ok, humans are selfish. Period.

From my experience in the pasts, they just want to be the prettier, slimmer friends/family of mine. So when we hang out, attention are always on them :)

Moral of the story: cut them off and be a healthier you :)"
"I know nobody cares BUT I ACTUALLY ATE AT A DEFICIT TODAY!!!!!! AND I DID MY FIRST FAST EVER!!!!! AND I DID 4000 STEPS!!!! I’m extremely proud of myself I know 4000 steps isn’t much at all, but compared to the 200 I do everyday without leaving my house, it’s quite a lot. I just went grocery shopping and that was 4000 steps or at least my phone tells me that.

I actually ate below my maintenance calories today! I ate about 1500 today, my TDEE is 1800 (or 1900 but I try to not eat more than 1800). I ate a 9piece mcnugget and I was kinda surprised to find out that’s only 435 cals. Thought it would be more. But yeah, I ate at a calorie deficit for like literally the first time in my life. I will keep going and I will get better and stronger with time.

I also did my first 16:8 fast today (I started 6pm yesterday, finished today 10am). Honestly, it was much easier than I thought it would be, and I felt surprisingly good afterwards. I thought I’d be starving but I wasn’t, I was just a bit hungry for a few hours, but it was perfectly manageable. I’m starting my second ever 16:8 fast in half an hour, but this time I’m doing 10pm to 12am because I feel like that fits my lifestyle much better (I go to sleep really late etc. so this way it’s more fitting)

Just wanted to get this out there. I’m super proud of myself. Here’s to a fucking healthier and happier life I guess!!!!!!

edit: thanks for all the replies and awards, def wasn’t expecting that many lol. I’m almost 2.5 hours into my 16hr fast right now, you guys are definitely giving me motivation. You are extremely supportive"
"Why I’m confident this time around. First post ever! Apologies in advance for the “TLDR” material. 

Let me start by saying I am so happy to have found this corner of the internet. Whenever I’ve gone through tough times in my life, finding a community that somehow understands my struggles has played a huge role in my recovery.

A little bit of background about me, I’m a Female, 31 years old, 5’3. SW: 170 CW: 158 GW:120.

Like a lot of you, I’ve been dealing with being overweight/obese for most of my life. I hit my highest weight when I was 15, at ~210 pounds. 

Coming from a family of slim beautiful girls, and living in a culture where looks are everything, this certainly made me feel “less worthy”. It was back then when I first decided I wanted to change my life.

By the time I turned 16 I had managed to lose 60 pounds. I did this with the help of a professional who taught me about calories, nutrients, metabolism, and helped me find healthy replacements for my then poor food choices.

Here’s when things started to derail. You see, naturally, I hit a plateau at this point. And though I’d lost a ton of weight and was healthier than ever, I never really had any other motivation for losing weight than to “be skinny and beautiful”

At 150lbs I still hated my body, maybe even more now that I was getting stretch marks all over me. I wanted to push this Plateau so badly that I started overworking and over restricting myself, which eventually led to me quitting, convincing myself that I was “never gonna be beautiful, so might as well stop being miserable and make myself happy with what I loved the most: food”

Lucky for me, I didn’t gain all the weight back, but I did gain some, and after seeing a trend and getting really worried, I went to a new professional. This time around I became literally obsessed with losing weight, to the point of not following my doctor’s meal plan because I thought it had “too many calories”. I lost weight alright, I went down to 114lbs -my lowest ever. But as you can guess, I couldn’t keep it off.

This was a tumultuous time. I was depressed, engaged in self destructing behavior, and eventually (at 19) I diagnosed with Disordered Eating and BPD. 

After my mental recovery, I gained a lot of weight again. This was almost unavoidable due to some of the medication I was taking and other circumstances. I think I had hit ~185lbs when I realized I had to get it together or this would backtrack all my personal progress and send me back into a depressive episode. 

That time around I lost the weight in a more healthy way, and I managed to remain in an “OK” weight (~140lbs) for a few years. 

But of course, life happens: Marriage, Office Job, Devastating Hip Arthritis Diagnosis followed by a very unsuccessful, traumatizing, painful and life changing surgery from which I never recovered fully and that left me using a cane to walk. Then divorce. 

*Trigger Warning*

As a depressive person, I honestly don’t know how I managed to not kill myself during this time. Losing my hip, then my husband, living alone in another country and struggling to walk from my bed to my bathroom in my very very tiny apartment. 

But I pulled through like never before. Maybe it was the years of therapy, maybe I just had no other choice. And eventually I met the love of my life, I landed the job of my dreams, and had a beautiful and healthy daughter.

I finally found a GOOD reason why I want to lose weight: I want to be healthier. I want to reduce the pain on my legs so I can play with my kid, live a better life, and stay strong. My disease is chronic and degenerative, so If I don’t do this, I’ll probably wont walk at all by the time I’m 50. 

The 12 pounds I’ve lost so far have already made such a huge difference in my mobility. Not to mention my energy levels! 

I’m sad that I had to go through all of this but happy I finally understood that we really need to treat our bodies better because we only have one life. And that my goals should be oriented towards that: a healthy and well nourished body. 

I guess the saying is true, you never know what you have until you lose it! Now that my body is a lot more fragile I really see the importance of taking care of myself! And this has made my weight-loss almost effortless because I feel happy and proud of treating my body the right way.

And the added bonus: teaching my child healthy habits so that she doesn’t have to suffer later on in life like I did.

Thanks for anyone who made it through this unbelievably lengthy post!! Wishing you all success in achieving your goals."
"Addiction to Takeout I'm 5 '6 and 190 lbs. I used to weigh 150lbs a few years ago and after discovering Uber Eats and Grubhub I've been trying to get back to that weight ever since. I was never exactly good with diets or great with exercise but every 72 hours like a clock I get takeout cravings and because food apps/websites are so accessible I constantly blow money on sushi, pizza, fries, tacos, etc... and I just spend my days alternating from 187 lbs to 190 lbs and back on repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have to lose the weight. I feel gross and embarrassed. Does anyone have suggestions on how to deal with the cravings and easy access to food? Before Covid I had joined a boxing gym but I haven't really been able to go since the lockdowns.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll just add that my wife is pretty normal. She likes the usual Friday takeout after a long week of working in the office, but it's a huge trigger for me. Her cravings trigger my cravings and it feels like an endless cycle."
"30 Day Accountability Challenge - Day 5 Hello losers,

Happy Friday! 

Weigh in daily, enter in Libra &amp; report here even if I don’t like it: 231.4 this morning, 231.1 lbs trend weight. Heeeey guess who has a uterus in full-fledged violent coup? This lady.

Stay within calorie range (1800): Doing okay here. More maintenance days than I like if I’m going to keep up the 3-4 pounds down a month but still better than a previous version of myself. 2/2 days.

Exercise 5 days a week: 30-minute brisk walk at lunch. 5/5 days.

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, nonfood rewards): Gonna have an easy evening in &amp; chill.

Try a new recipe once a week: Romanesco, roasted. New veggie, new recipe, I say it counts even though it tasted like a fun broccoli cauliflower love child. 1/4 weeks.

Express mindfulness and or gratitude: Today I’m grateful for all the things. All of you lovely folks. All the places in the internet to commune with people. Every. Single. Cat. Especially internet cats. 

Your turn!"
"I’m at a breaking point. I weighed 150 before quarantine last year and that was not ideal. When quarantine hit I gained 30 pounds. Ever since then, I have been fluctuating anywhere between 180-190 pounds, never below that. I’m so sick of feeling fat and gross. Everyone says do a calorie deficit. I’m not even eating a lot. Everyone says get exercise in. I’m moving around now more than I was before. Everyone says drink water. I. Am. Trying. Nothing is working and at this point I’m just embarrassed that if I die my family will have to worry about finding clothes that fit because nothing does right now. I’m so sick of being fat as hell but I’m nit trying to starve to death losing weight. I’m ready to do Intensive workouts and stop eating because none of the healthy or unhealthy foods I’ve been taking in are benefiting me at all."
"2021 My ""Kobe"" year right ! Finally out of the 300 club! SW 348 CW 299 Hello everyone ! Just wanted to share my journey so far, I do not have many people to tell IRL so that is the reason for this post. Just wanted somewhere to express my happiness and excitement.  

Just stepped on the scale this morning, its a weekly thing I do on Friday just to track my progress. Small or big , I am always excited to see the outcome! Today when I stepped on that scale it read 299. I shed a tear of excitement. I have not been at this weight since highschool and it is amazing to even say that. Sure it is only a pound under 300 but I know that with my commitment it is not going to go up anymore! 

 I never in a million years thought I would be able to commit and actually make progress in losing the weight. I have been running 5-6 days a week now and started weightlifting about 2 weeks ago now too. I have also been counting calories and managed to stay in a deficit since then, it was tough at first but it definitely does get easier."

"Here’s what 33 lbs of chicken breast looks like... it was 99c/lb, and I couldn’t resist stocking up. I’ve lost 82 lbs (250 to 168, 6’/m) since July 5 eating a grilled chicken salad 6 nights a week. I grill them, chop them up, and vacuum seal 18oz bags, then use 2 bags a week at 6oz per salad. [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/Zz5EzQH) the ridiculous amount of chicken breast I just bought... I think it’s a new record for me. I’ve never bought more than a pack or two at a time, but at that price (99c/lb) I couldn’t say no. I originally bought 15 lbs, then got home and realized “you know what, I eat chicken 6x a week, so why not just really load up?” then went back and got another 15.

I’m 6’/male and have been eating 1500 calories a day. I usually snack on fruits and veggies throughout the day, then each night I have a [massive salad](https://imgur.com/a/Rc5WFTu) with 6oz or chicken on it. I started on July 5 at 250 lbs and I’m currently 168 - which is 3 lbs away from my original target. So, I knew it wasn’t going to go to waste... and at that price, I just couldn’t resist.

Plus, I’m mentally changing gears from losing weight to adding muscle and building strength while maintaining between 170 and 180, and I’ve heard it’s important to eat whole foods rather than relying primarily on protein powder for protein, so it looks like I’m going to be getting pretty creative about what I’ll fix with all of this chicken. Probably lots and lots of pho, or bbq chicken with mixed veggies."
"I'm struggling to get started Appreciate so many have over come this barrier. And maybe this is pretty small in terms of the hurdles others are overcoming.

My weight gain in (UK) lockdown and WFH the whole time, is more than I'd like. As in a few stone and a few dress sizes. I've gained a lot of weight. I want to hope I'll be able to work on it when gyms open. Two weeks ago, I made a mental aim to work on it and a week later turned an ankle that is still angry. And I had a recovering dislocated left knee and a sprained right ankle at the start of lockdown!

I normally can do a big push and then settle into a routine but lockdowns and trying to be careful have strained it. I'm worried  beyond my known zone. I've never been thin thin, but I've been fit? I'd like to get back to somewhat fit. I hate what I see. Am I beyond it? Can I do it? 

Please, I'm struggling to find light at a time when all I can do is work in my home office and watch stuff at home. I'm used to pushing myself, and I can't find a lighter middle ground."
"Broke my diet for the first time in 3 months, and feeling like a complete failure I'm SO close to being 30lbs down. I've gone from 188lbs to 160lbs since late December just counting calories and walking. My goal is 150lbs, but I'd love to be 130 someday, even though it feels impossible.

Lately I've been struggling to keep a significant defecit and today I went over my calorie budget for the first time in 3 months. I ate a whole box of girl scout peanut butter delights while crying my eyes out. I'm battling a deep depression and it's been so bad this past week I can barely function. Food has always been my greatest comfort, and to be honest, eating all those cookies felt amazing.

I feel so weak and disappointed in myself, and the temptation to just say ""fuck it"" and eat everything in the pantry is so strong. I really need support right now. To be reminded why I'm doing this, and that my progress isn't ruined, and that I'm not a terrible person."
"Can't find the motivation, even as it becomes more urgent. Here I am, at the largest I've ever been. 340 pounds. I'm 5'10, I carry it pretty evenly throughout my body, so those close to me don't believe I'm above 300 (or they're very convincing liars), but I feel awful. I am starting to feel myself not be able to do things I used to, like bake for a couple of hours without needing to sit down and rest. I'm about to hit 30, and I know that the longer this goes on, the worse it gets. 

Yet I don't seem to care enough to really want to change it. I lost my dad a few months ago, and I don't know if it's the grief mixed with the fact that I already treated food like a security blanket before, but I really just don't care now. I know the complications, I know the risks, and the logical part of my brain is terrified of them. But here I am, worrying and resenting my body in one half of my brain while the other side that wants to stuff my face with sugar and snacks wins. I don't know what to do."
"Dancing as exercise? With it or not? Why? So I've always loved dancing even though I was really bad at it (think Tina from Bob's Burgers twerking, not exaggerating). Well I recently got better at it by going to the very basics which encouraged me to get better. Now I can say confidently that I can dance and it's so amazing. So what are you guys' opinions?

So AutoMod said my post had too little content so my story is down below:

I honestly thought my ability to dance was genetic because my entire family were so bad at it as well. I would ask my friends for help in school and I was literally told never to dance in public, that there's no hope for me, etc in dead seriousness. And these were people that were completely nice otherwise and so would have no reason to make me feel bad. Nevertheless, I would still dance very cringily in my room at least once a month for almost half a decade and watch people who could dance and envy them. I should also mention that dancing is a very big part of my culture so the average person essentially has the skill of a professional dancer. It got in the way of my life a lot in several ways. And even by normal standards (I moved to the West) I was still considered an atrocious dancer.

One day (one of those days being when I dance in my room), I was watching a simple dance challenge and told myself I was going to do the best I could. So I did something different. I went to the very basics. In my culture, the hips are a very very important part of dancing. So I watched a belly dancing tutorial. That was all it took. Within about 3 days I could do the challenge. From then on, I branched out to other challenges, the trendy but hard dances, other forms of dancing, etc. Right now I know moves from West Africa, the Carribean, the USA, the Middle East and many more."
"I will not be discouraged by a plateau. I will not be discouraged by a plateau. I will not... After 6 weeks of steady, robust weight loss, I hit my first plateau.  For the past 2 weeks, I have kept on track with CICO but the scale has only gone down a total of 1.2 pounds.  

Luckily, besides measuring progress with the scale, I have been measuring my waistline and bust-line.  Both have gone down.  That and my clothes fit a lot better. 

In the past, I would get discouraged at this point and overeat something because, well, what difference does it make anyway?  I'm just not meant to lose weight (or some other defeatist thinking).  This time, I am going to push through and put faith in the process.  Even if I don't get a magical ""WOOSH"" to validate my efforts, I think, ""What if I do continue but only lose 24 pounds between now and the end of the year?  I'd still be better off than where I am now.""  

Two roads diverged in the woods.  And I - I took the one less traveled by.  And that will make all the difference.  I hope so, anyway."
"My Journey so far Most of the time I try and lead a healthy lifestyle but in recent times I became very sedentary and over time my weight went from an overweight 87kg to 90kg, I knew if I didn’t take action this fat and weight gain would spiral out of control and cause all types of health issues associated with obesity.  So, I have decided to go on a Health Wellness Fitness Journey.

I am doing a combination of weight training, cycling -- outdoors and intermittent fasting which I didn't even know I was doing as I normally eat between 10:00 am and 6:00 pm which falls into the 16:8 intermittent fasting window.

I am 8 weeks into my journey my weight has gone from 90kg to 85kg and my waist has dropped from 42"" to 39"".

My long term goal is to reduce my waist to anything between 32"" - 35""

Stay healthy people"
"In need of advice even though I already have somewhat of a solution. 17F 5’2 SW: 160 CW: 132 GW: 110-120

TW: disordered eating, also I am in no way encouraging eating the way I did, just giving you my story and seeking advice.

This year so far has unfortunately been a tough one for me in terms of food. When I was overweight I struggled with binge eating (wasn’t diagnosed) and it got to the point where I was doing it almost everyday. Fast forward to September 2020 and I started practicing portion control. Towards the end of October I got started CICO with a combo of intermittent fasting. It ended up working out great obviously and I finally start to lose weight and had not binged since before I started losing, there were a few days I overate but they couldn’t compare to how I was eating before.

Since I got down to around 132 I had been feeling slightly hungrier even though I’d been eating around 1400 calories since the beginning of my journey. I started getting a little impatient because I’ve been sedentary for the most part and knew I needed to create a bigger deficit because I wasn’t burning as much as before. So I did that and it was going okay until recently.

About a week ago I was PMSing and I had cravings so I had a few maintenance days to combat this problem and it normally works out okay. Well this time I overate 2 days in a row and ended with a binge on the last day, which was at least 4000+ calories (I didn’t count). I ate past the point of being sick (although somehow I didn’t throw up) and afterwards I was in so much pain that I literally thought my stomach was going to burst. I hadn’t eaten like that in so long and I’m not that big of a person so I suffered in the days that followed. When I stepped on the scale the next morning I weighed 137 and I panicked. So I restricted the next 4 days and ate under 1000 calories. I know it’s not okay to eat this much or little but I wasn’t really thinking straight and wanted to get back down to my original weight quickly. It worked and I got back down to 132 so I decided I would eat 1200 and have one maintenance day of 1600 per week. 

Yesterday I ate 2000 instead of 1600 for my maintenance day and today I ate my actual maintenance rather than going back down to 1200. The kicker is I’m still hungry (yay!). I know some of you will say “1200 isn’t enough! Your young and that’s what a toddler needs, blah, blah, blah.” Please don’t tell me this. I am a short person with a low TDEE and even with extra walking I can’t eat a lot. I also don’t do high intensity exercise because it increases my hunger. I am waiting to start doing more workouts once I hit my goal range so I can eat an adequate amount. 

So that’s what’s happened so far and I’m just struggling. Ever since I’ve got to the low 130s my hunger has been out of control. I just have a strong desire to eat and I don’t even remember how I did it the rest of the time when I was in a deficit. I’ve heard a bit about having a “set point” in terms of weight and I think 134 may be mine. The lowest weight I can remember weighing at this height was 134 and then I went up from there. No matter what it seems like I can’t get past 130 and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried eating at different times of the day from 5 meals to 2 meals (I think 2 works best) but it isn’t helping anymore. I already also practice volume eating and I make sure to eat enough protein, so I’m just like: what else can I do?!?

My last solution is to take a maintenance break for about 2 weeks and then slowly go down by 50 calories each week until I reach 1300. I’ve taken maintenance breaks before and I was going to do so at 130 but I guess I’m going to start it now. If anyone has any advice or has experienced this I would really appreciate hearing your thoughts! I don’t know any other solutions and I’m feeling pretty frustrated after these past few months."
"The Longest Plateau and I’m Confused? I started following CICO (about 1500 cals/ day, give or take up to 100) last October. I lost 25 pounds fairly quickly- by mid-December actually. Since then I’ve  hovered in this sort of...purgatory of plateaus. I’ll lose a pound, gain 2 back, lose 2, gain 1...etc, etc, etc. 

I am maintaining CICO at ~1500 cals, my job is moderately active, I drink a lot of water, no pop, minimal caffeine and generally try to eat more nutrient dense/ less calorie dense foods. 

I didn’t think it was normal for a plateau to go on for almost 3 months?!? What am I doing wrong? Have you experienced this? How did you get the scale moving again??"
"I am ashamed, and I need help I’m a very young breast cancer survivor. My particular type of breast cancer was estrogen receptor positive, which means it was fueled by estrogen. This is simplified, but during the course of treatment, I learned that estrogen is stored in fat. Hence why being overweight increases your risk of developing cancer. 

So for my health, I really need to lose weight.  But I haven’t. I have continued to gain weight. And I’m ashamed because cancer should have been a wake up call but it hasn’t. Even with Covid, it hasn’t been enough. I know I need to count calories but I don’t know how. Unless I want to eat grilled chicken breasts and steamed broccoli for the rest of my life. 

I also have a husband who, bless his heart has tried nothing and is out of ideas. He’s talking about how he wants to “lose belly fat” and was eyeing a green tea supplement at Costco."
The power of water. Here is what I have found out about water and weight loss. Starting the day by filling stomach up with water and waiting until hunger passes to eat or to wait thirty minutes before doing some cardio(calorie burning) has helped me lose 80 lbs. spacing your meals out and fighting hunger by the use of water is the safest method of weight loss I have tried and it is the only way the weight has stayed off. Staying with water for a consistent 3 months(no alcohol) has allowed my cellular processes to change so that my metabolism is up and I am now accustomed to getting energy from nutritious diet of my choosing.
"i hit my first milestone :D omg so i been tryna lose weight just for health and overall happy feelings of my body. I started at 202 or so and now im down to 190 :D. Ik it probably seems minor to yall but that was like a really big accomplishment for me. I feel like im being more active and energetic nowadays and can also see it in my fitbit logs LMAO. Im hitting 10k steps at least 2-3 times a week which probably sounds dumb to yall but is a big accomplishment for me. My next goal is gonna be to drop at least 3 pounds by the end of march. It isn't too big but i dont wanna bite off more than i can chew. Plus, at least if i dont make my goal too big itll feel more doable yknow? I've been changing my eating style (not saying its completely getting better but its definantely changed) Im eating more sort of but its lower in calories than what i used to eat. I'm really trying to cut back on the sweets so like ive been trying to at least get it under 4g of sugar (btw is that healthy-) if its a snack type thing.   


Is anyone interested in being my workout buddy? I wanna try a new sport so I'm thinking about using that as another motivator. I wanna try and lose a couple pounds before the season starts because it involves fast pace running type stuff and i dont wanna tire out too fast. does anyone have any tips for stopping urself from bored eating btw? I really need to work on that and i think if i get better with not doing it ill feel a lot better about things. I know this was sorta a lot but like i was really excited :)"

"I hit milestone 1/12!!! - Starting weight: 310
- Current weight: 284.6
- Weight lost: 25.4
- Goal weight: 137
- Left to go: 147.6

Today I hit my first milestone which was -25 lbs. 

I started at Christmas when my sister got engaged. She’s in the Air Force Academy and can’t get married until she graduates in 2024 so that’s more than enough time for me to lose all my weight, so it motivated me to get started.

First I started by only eating lean cuisines and tracking all my calories in My Fitness Pal. Yes I know OMG THE SODIUM. You know what else has lots of sodium? Getting fast food 3 times a day. I had to start somewhere. I did it to relearn portion sizes. I was never really a snacker I was just eating huge meals. I started eating 3 lean cuisines plus having 3 healthy snacks throughout the day.

Then as time went on I slowly started phasing out the lean cuisines. I still haven’t weaned off them completely, I still have a few per week. I have a lot to learn with cooking and meal prep. But I’m doing well so far.

Currently I am eating 1300 calories a day and not doing much exercise. I go to an aqua fit class 2 times per week. I’m trying to get out and walk my dog more but I’ve been bad about it.

As far as a reward for hitting this milestone goes.. I know rewarding with food is frowned upon but there’s not any material thing I want so my husband and I were trying to think of more “experience” type rewards. That’s hard right now with covid. So we settled on getting really good quality sushi and getting a bunch of random things we’ve never tried before. 

My next milestone is 270 which is 14.6 pounds down from where I’m at now. My happy scale app predicts I’ll hit that on June 16. But they also predicted I’d hit this milestone on April 9 which was over a month off so hopefully I can beat the June 16 deadline!"
"Here we go again... Today is day 1! I have very mixed feelings after I went on the scale today for the first time since six months (!). 

I started the previous weight-loosing cycle November 2018 with a starting weight of 195 lbs (female, 5'6''). The following month I lost continually weight and around November 2019 I had lost 30 lbs (CICO + moderate weight lifting program). But then the corona pandemic hit. Most of the time the gyms were closed and I worked nearly the whole time from home. Between March 2019 and August 2019 I gained a little weight but not too dramatic. Because of lack of movement and working (sitting) more I got problems with my back, which caused me to move (initially) even less. 

I knew that I gained even more weight as my clothing began to fit more tightly, but I was so afraid of seeing the damage that I avoided the scale. Today I mustered enough courage to step on the scale. What can I say: with 192 lbs I almost weigh as much as I did last in November 2018... Although this is so frustrating, I am somehow relieved. I feel like I took over control again with stepping on the scale and knowing how much I weigh. 

I am motivated to lose this weight again, and hopefully even more. My dream-weight is 145 lbs. 

Here we go again!"
"New to Reddit hoping for some advice Hi guys I’m new here so sorry if I’m posting wrong haha. I’m 23 I’ve had a difficult two years but not gonna go into it, I weighed myself - looked at my fitness app from 3 years ago and realised I’ve gained over 3 stone. I’m 5”7 and weighed in at 14 stone. 6ibs. On Monday I decided to start a diet 1600 cals a day, I’ve been walking more but if I’m honest generally I’m sedentary as I have an office job. This week I’ve done 1600 cals each day and hit my 10k steps which is about 8000 more than usual! I’ve also been drinking 2 litres of water a day and cut caffeine (before I never drank water, only red bull, coke, coffee, squash etc.) I was aiming to lose 1-2 Ibs a week, I wanted to do it slowly as I had an eating disorder at 16 and don’t want to get into bad habits again. I weighed myself yesterday end of day 5, and I’ve lost 5ibs! (Made sure to weigh same time of day) Very happy just wanna check really this is okay and healthy? I’m assuming it’s mostly water weight? Just hoping for some advice really? I’m also a smoker and want to get into running, I’d like to quit but don’t think I have the will power to do the clean eating and quitting smoking at the same time. Any advice on that? Thank you all"
"Life is though Why is life so hard? Why is it so hard to look at food and only take one bite? Why is it so hard to control what you eat? I can’t take it anymore. I hate the feeling of eagerly craving something, than having guilt show up afterwards and take over my whole soul and mentality. I feel ashamed every-time this happens. From this, insecurities grow. I become sluggish and lazy. I drift away from my goals. I start hating who I am. Imagine all the things we could be if we weren’t controlled by insecurity. Unfortunately, I’d never get to experience that feeling. The feeling of not caring what others think. The feeling of having a good relationship with food. The feeling of loving myself."
"weight loss stagnation - please help? Hi!

I've been trying to lose weight since the start of December and at first it was going really well! My starting weight was 190lb and I'm trying to drop down to 155-ish (tbh almost anywhere in the 150s is good for now). Between December and the end of feb I dropped down to 176.2 but since then its just... stayed there. I'm a 5'7 guy, I'm disabled so my exercise is limited but I do about an hour on my spin bike weekly (I can only do it for 20 mins at a time, but I get upwards of 15km on it at fairly high resistance 3 times a week so it should be a fair few calories).

I'm eating about 1,500 kcal to 1,600 kcal a day. Usually its all homecooked meals (which I manage) as my fiance has dietary requirements. Generally we are fairly high protein though I wont deny there are quite a few carbs as well - but under or matching what 'Myfitnesspal' suggests I do. I can only walk/exercise for about 20 minutes at a time and I'm in full time distance education so time to do things has been difficult.

I'm getting frustrated, the last two weeks I've only dropped 0.2lbs when before I was easily doing at least 1lb a week. Any advice for me? Is this something I just have to wait out and it'll start dropping again? I've never tried to lose weight before so its all new..."
"Hit goal weight in January after a slow loss (0.5lb/week), then had loss and grief to deal with...now up 13 pounds Hello all, and Happy Friday! First off, I want to thank everyone in this community - I've been around off and on \~5 years, and this really is such an uplifting and inspiring community. 

So, I want to share some struggles I've had recently, in the hope that it will be cathartic for me, and also hopefully will help others who are also struggling. 

Current stats: 30F, 5'6"", HW:175lb, SW: 168lb, CW: 143lb, GW: 130lb (reached in January 2021...not there currently)

Background: I've struggled with being overweight since my early teens. I started gaining around age 11-12 or so, and by the time I was 15, I weighed 175. At the time, my mom went on a low carb diet and began losing weight. I followed something similar, but not strictly low carb, just less food in general, but still ate some carbs and junk food. Tried to move more, etc. By the time I was 16, I was about 145lb or so, and pretty happy with that. By the time I was 18, I had gotten to \~132 without trying - I think having active jobs helped. At age 18, there were a lot of changes in my life: moved out, started university, started drinking, and started a toxic relationship. That all results in a slow gain over the next few years, and although there were MANY attempts to lose weight, none of them really stuck. The combo of the relationship, stress and drinking did not do me any favors. 

Beginning of 2013, age 23, I was 160 pounds, and just starting a new relationship. I quickly gained 15 pounds in \~9 months or so due to eating a bit more junk and bigger portion sizes (the new bf is very active and eats OMAD...so I shouldn't be eating anywhere close to what he does.) At that point, I had reached my HW of 175 again, and I realized I needed to make a change, and started losing (I was also diagnosed as pre-diabetic based on A1C, so that gave me a concrete health reason to lose weight.) From 2014-2019, I cycled from 143-165 several times, each time not quite getting to my goal of 130. I learned valuable things with each cycle - for example, I dropped breakfast a long time ago, and almost never eat it now (I eat more through the day when I do eat breakfast.) I realized low carb is not for me, and I can't sustain it forever, so it's better to for me to just calorie count. However, I also need to focus on healthier foods overall for sustainability and health. Thankfully, my A1C has been in the normal range every time I've had it checked since 2014. 

Cue to June 2019 - back at 168lb, and I knew I had to do something about it. I read something here on loseit that really helped me change my perspective. ""Don't let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway."" From then on I decided I had to make small, slow, SUSTAINABLE (i.e., lifestyle) changes, or I would keep on weight cycling forever. I started just counting calories again and aiming for some type of workout 2x per week. From there, I slowly continued to add things, adjust, etc., not focusing on how long it would take at all. Focusing on sustainable habits, consistency and patience. From June 2019 to December 2020, I went from 168 to 132 pounds, which is close to 0.5lb/week. 

Mid-December 2020: I quit smoking weed due to a possible new job (I started smoking in 2013, which has helped reduce drinking drastically since then. There is some willpower initially to not give in to munchies.) From there, I lost weight pretty quickly, and saw my GW of 130 on January 2, 2021. At this point, I was toying with whether or not I should go to 125, and then try to gain muscle. On January 14th (after seeing 129 a couple times!) I decided, this is it, I should try to focus on maintenance for now. That same day, I got rejected for the job I was applying for. Cue weed smoking again that evening. I decided to eat some of the christmas chocolates we had around (I really didn't indulge much over christmas due to not having much of an appetite.) That was all fine, I logged everything, and didn't go crazy. Two days later, on January 16th, we found out that our dog had cancer. Literally, one of my best friends, and my baby...I'm getting teary eyed just typing this out. We were in shock, and not sure how much longer we'd have with her. This is when healthy habits just started getting thrown out the window - no calorie counting, no workouts. I had to spend as much time with her as possible. The next day, we decided we had to put her down sooner than later due to some difficulty she was having with walking (the tumor was growing very quickly.) We called the next morning, and scheduled her appt for later that day. Since then, my ass has been kicked in trying to deal with the grief of losing her. Long story short, I'm back up to 143 pounds about 6 weeks later, which is not good. I do not want all of my progress to be undone. I've managed to mostly keep up with workouts, which is good. Food has been a struggle though. I definitely am an emotional eater, and I'm really trying to find ways to deal with the emotions better. Working out does help, but at night when I miss her...emotional eating can easily undo all of the hard work of working out. I committed again yesterday to log everything, no matter what. I had tried to restart logging several times, but just struggled with it. I'm in a little better place now...still missing her terribly, but I know that I will regret it if I don't course-correct now. 

I just needed to get this off my chest, and I appreciate every single person who took the time to read this. You can only do your best, and your best looks different every day. Remember to give yourself grace and understanding. Life is not easy, and there will be struggles. Even if you didn't make good decisions last week, yesterday, this morning - you can still make a good decision right now. I believe in you."
"Finally weighed myself and realised it's time to get it together For starters: I'm a 21 year old woman and I'm 165 cm (5'5""). So, in February 2020 I've reached my lowest weight ever, which was 59 kg (130 lbs) and I was absolutely overjoyed, as I've been working on getting to that point for over 3 months. And then COVID struck and I left my uni city to spend lockdown with my parents aaaaand... well, started gaining weight.

Just to be clear: although I was fit, I was also quite unhealthy. I was cold all the damn time, I couldn't stop thinking about food, I lost my period (and got it back after over half a year). So when lockdown started and eventually lasted for more than expected 2 weeks, I started bingeing. Regularly.

In summer I weighed myself for the first time since February, because I was too scared to see how much exactly I've put on. And well, I weighed 78 kg (172 lbs). I, of course, decided that I needed to lose it all back again, especially since the pandemic supposedly was coming to an end in my country and I just couldn't look at myself in the mirror. Unsurprisingly, I failed and not only did not *lose* any weight, I actually started eating absolutely *massive* amounts of food, mostly because I was living alone at the time and felt no pressure, since the second lockdown started and I've only hung out with friend over zoom etc. Looking back now, I have no idea how I could stuff myself so much. It's like a different lifetime.

Anyways, I again moved back to my parents and I thought, ""well, it's now or never, let's just do it"". Sadly, I just couldn't get motivated. Like, at all. Fortunately, since I now actually lived with people, I worked on my ridiculous eating habits and now, after 3 months, I can say I eat fairly healthy.

BUT I have not weighed myself since summer, simply because I was too scared to see how much more I've put on. But today I woke up and felt good about it and made use of my scale. I officially weigh the most I've ever had in my entire life, which is 81 kg (178 lbs). I'm not mortified. I'm not angry. I'm just tired of living in this weird and ungracious body and I miss my lovely clothes. I feel like I finally got the kick in the butt that I've so desperately needed. And so today was the first day in the last x months that I actually stuck to my calories. I did a FBW that I used to do and I enjoyed it *so much*!

I guess I'm posting this all to hold myself accountable, because regular journals never seem to work for me. I hereby make a promise to myself to post here at least monthly and update my journey, because I'm finally ready to get back the fit and sporty girl I've been known as, before the pandemic hit. Thank you for reading, if you did, and I wish us all much strength on our journeys."
"I promised myself I wouldn’t give up, but I’m so discouraged. I just discovered this community (is that what it’s called?) and I’m hoping it will give me the motivation I need and help me find some answers :/

I’m a 20 year old female. I’ve been overweight almost my entire life. My highest weight is 222.8 pounds (I’m 5’6) and I’ve gotten down to 198.4 since September.

Ive tried to lose weight numerous times. In high school, I struggled with anorexia for about a year and lost about 50 pounds in 2 months. I got down to my lowest weight, which was 145 pounds. Due to stress and depression, I eventually started showing signs of binge eating disorder and ate my way up to 222lbs.

Another important part of my story is that I have had rheumatoid arthritis since I was 4 years. It is hard for me to be in my feet for more than 2 or 3 hours. I have limited mobility in my ankles, which makes it hard for me to run and do certain exercises. I try my best to workout and get in as many steps as I can, but I have promised myself that I will not push my body too far in terms of my arthritis.

So flash forward to today. I have lost almost 25 pounds, which sounds pretty good. But it has taken me 6 months. 

When I lost those 25 pounds, I was not exercising. I was on a strict 1200-1300 calorie “diet”- I know now that this was NOT healthy!!! I was dropping weight so fast, but eventually I would binge, which lead me to eating whatever I wanted for 2-3 weeks.

I take full accountability. I know I should have stuck with it, but I didn’t. I promised myself I would not give up this time, so every time I failed, I eventually picked myself back up.

But ever since the start of the new year, I have been having so much trouble losing weight. I have barely lost a thing. Maybe 5 pounds at most.

In January I ate about 1300-1400 calories a day. No exercise. Didn’t lose anything. I took a week off and ate whatever I wanted to try to reset my metabolism. Started dieting again, weighed in and lost 4 pounds. The next week I weighed in and lost absolutely nothing. Not even an ounce.

So I took a week off again and ate whatever I wanted then started the diet again. I started to exercise and ate about 1500 calories. Like I said, I don’t get many steps in due to my arthritis, but I was burning enough calories through exercise to get me down to 1200 calories per day.

I have been doing that since mid February, and have barely seen results.

I weighed in last week and only lost .4 pounds.

Today I looked down at my stomach to see new stretch marks. I broke down into tears? How?!? Why?!? I know for a fact I have not gained. It is just not possible. There is no way. 

What am I doing wrong?

Is it possible that I am losing weight but gaining enough muscle each week to balance it out... since I’m new to working out?

I just feel so discouraged. I’ve been working so hard. Should I exercise more? And burn more calories?

I drink almost a gallon of water a day!!

I just want to give up. I know I can’t. But I want to.

I take measurements, and I lost 4 inches last week, but I’ve convinced myself that it’s because I didn’t measure in the exact same spot that I did the week before. 

I don’t look any different. I don’t look like I’ve lost weight within the last month or so.

What’s wrong with me? Does anyone have advice or insight? Their own experience? Help, please. I just don’t know what to do. I am so tired of living like this, and I just want to be healthy and confident for once in my lifetime."
"How long between cheat meals? So basic stats first: 39M, 5’10”, Start Date Nov 22 2020.  SW: 261.1  CW: 216.5 (44.6 pounds lost). 1500 kcal a day. Current TDEE: ~2300

So I don’t have a fixed schedule for cheat days, I vaguely try to average once or twice a month, but that’s not set in stone. I do try to limit cheat days to simply eating maintenance instead of going nuts, and most of the time I’m successful at that, but of course occasionally I’ll go crazy. Today I’m eating at TDEE maintenance cause fuck it, it’s been 4 weeks since my last cheat meal. 

That said, I became kind of curious. How often do you all have cheat meals/cheat days? Do you do TDEE or go totally into fuck it mode? How does it work for you? How many days does it take you to recover to the weight you had prior to cheating? I guess I just want some perspective because there isn’t really anyone for me to talk with this about in our COVID wonderland of isolation. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds. Have a good one!"
"Need advice about beating plateaus! Hi all, first time posting but ive been on my weightloss journey for around 8 months now. Im currently doing CICO and 30mins of running + some weightlfting 3-4 times a week. At my heaviest i weighed somewhere around 279 pounds but ive managed to lose around 60 pounds so far sitting in the 220 area. Im hoping to lose around 40ish more pounds to reach my goal but started hitting snags around november last year with my weightloss slowing! Starting off i was eating around 1700 calories a day and had pretty consistant weight loss until december when i maintained the same weight for the christmas period. I dropped my intake to 1580 calories and lost around 4 more pounds in january but now its slowed yet again with me only managing to drop 2 pounds over febuary despite diet and exercise. Its starting to affect my motivation and im just looking for any advice from people who beat similar situations. The only changes i can think of is being less strict with IF and caving for more cheat days due to the lack of motivation (but even with these days my calorie restriction and regular exercise should be doing more than they are). Any help is appreciated!"
"Visceral fat and stubborn fat [21 F] 
5’2 
start weight: 180 and got to 160. 
Took a break for a year and maintained that weight. 
Got back on track and since July 2020 I am now 124 lbs. 

measurements roughly - 
ribs 29, 
waist 28, 
biggest part of belly: 32 
hips 38

Goals - smaller belly 

Can someone explain visceral fat and how losing it visually affects your physique? 

I have lost 40 pounds and I’m on my last 5-10 pounds. I feel like I look too skinny because my face, arms, and legs are very small now, the only issue is The last place my fat wants to leave is my lower back/love handles/lower stomach. These are the places I wanted to lose weight from the most but it just seems the last 10 pounds I have are in those areas. Can I expect to lose fat in those places eventually, or is there a chance it would be unsafe to keep lifting until I can get that fat off? I KNOW some fat is absolutely necessary for health, but this fat doesn’t look like it’s necessary in my opinion. I would post pictures but I’m too self conscious. Also there is a chance I can be struggling with body dysmorphia. If someone can give their opinion that would be great. 

Next, i very protruded ribs and I’ve heard that it can be because of visceral fat. I also know there’s a possibility that my frame is just big, but all of my fam is typically small framed. Anyone have experience with this? I feel like I’m going to piss some people off with these questions, but I’m new and learning and just want to reach my goals healthily."
"Will Caroline Girvan's epic program make me bulky? I've already tried a few of her workouts and i love the way she works. Her being completely ripped is also a good motivation to keep working out but i'm a little scared if i'm going to do her program i'm going to become bulky. I know it's a lot more work than just one workout everyday to become as muscular as her, i also know that the weights i use (2kg) aren't enough for that. But for example my legs already are quite muscular, especially my calves, and i'm worried that because of all the lunges and squats and all of that, they're going to bulk up even more. 

What are your opinions on this? and are there other free fitness programs you'd recommend?"
"Is there a guide on how to lose weight in a mentally healthy way? This might be a dumb question but I genuinely need help.  I’ve tried successfully throughout the years to lose weight, but never manage to keep it off because I slippery slope into fitness/nutrition obsession before burning out and refusing to get out of bed for weeks.  Of course while binging and purging and gaining it all back. 

I don’t get as severely depressed or go through binge/purge cycles when I’m not actively trying to lose weight.  For obvious reasons, I’m scared of trying again and my partner is scared of me trying again.  I’m not happy with my body and I want to lose weight.  I’m terrified of being sucked into my own obsessions, control freak behavior, and depression.

Edit: thank you for the helpful comments.  To clarify, I recognize that slow is the way to go.  I guess my question is how do you fight against that desire to go fast or be perfect, the constant mental comparisons to the success of others, and other sabotaging thoughts?"
"Drinking more water makes me feel dehydrated? Whenever I get on health kicks and start drinking at least 8-12 cups of water a day, I notice that #1 i get super thirsty at night and #2 i feel almost dehydrated in the morning, headache and super groggy, along with the really concentrated urine which makes it seem like I didn't just chug water all of the previous day. The problem is, drinking so much makes me have to pee alot more and if I drink super late at night, I'll just have to get up a few times during the night. 

Does anyone know why drinking more water would make me feel this way? I've been drinking this amount of water for a few weeks now, so I don't think its about my body trying to adjust to the higher intake of liquid"
"Is diet necessary or can i just reduce my food intake? 19M. 170cm and 77kg weight. Im a lazy workout guy, basically i worked out great precovid and now its been a year since no gym workout, ik its bad im sorry. Pre-covid i was at 70kg, much better shape, motivated. Luckily i didnt gain as much as my friends but now its weighing up on me, no pun intended. Ik intermittent isnt the recommended style but it has helped me stop gaining more than what i currently weigh. Indian dude and vegetarian, i eat nonveg but not regularly, i was wondering if i could just reduce the quantity of intake, w more proteins for a fat loss program or is a strict diet is necessary?
Also what should be my target weight? In the 60kgs range?"
"Running with LoseIt - 3/5/2021 - Running and Insulin Sensitivity This is a 'weekly' post for the runners of LoseIt. I've been crazy busy with work the last few months and it's made this erratic. 

All levels of runner are welcome here, from first timers to experienced  marathoners. We welcome someone who just ran for the first time or is just starting couch to 5K ([r/c25k](https://www.reddit.com/r/c25k/)) as eagerly as someone who has thousands of miles of experience.

This post is for sharing your weekly progress or excitement with running. From training you got in this last week, your first run, a virtual race, or a real race, we'd love to hear what you did. Got a running related NSV (non-scale victory), we'd love to hear. Have a question or need advice, we are here to help.

In addition to sharing your progress each week, I ramble on about some topic related to running. This week's topic -- Running and Insulin Sensitivity. I will say before I dive into this material, I'm no scientist. I don't pretend to be an expert here. 

# Insulin Sensitivity

I think when people seen the word insulin, they immediately think diabetes. But insulin manages the level of blood sugar in all people -- with or without diabetes. So, how sensitive you are to insulin in your body means you manage your blood sugar levels better with less insulin in your blood stream. At some point a tiny bit of insulin takes care of managing your glucose level. Now decreased insulin sensitivity, mainly as it decreases or is poor to insulin resistance levels, is something that leads to type 2 diabetes. This is the condition where you need more and more insulin to manage your blood sugar. 

# Running and Insulin Sensitivity

The article here is 10 years old, but it's still incredibly relevant today.  

[Exercise and Insulin Sensitivity—Where Do We Stand? You’d Better Run!](https://www.touchendocrinology.com/diabetes/journal-articles/exercise-and-insulin-sensitivity-where-do-we-stand-youd-better-run/)

There's two incredible things that regular running does for you. 

First, it increases your sensitivity after a single session of running. And, after regular running for six weeks, it's nearly twice the increase in sensitivity.  And if you have some insulin resistant condition, there is great evidence that the response is even greater. The only dissenting evidence is that the response is equal to those without any conditions. 

Second, more insulin sensitivity helps you develop lean mass over adipose fat. I can't say this part enough. One of the amazing things that exercise gives you is it unlocks more and more the ability of your body to use calories to build lean mass. Insulin sensitivity tracks to opening those pathways to put on muscle -- but it isn't the whole story. 

# Is Running special in this regard?

Running is the sweet spot here. Any exercise is great for you. It's moderate/vigorous aerobic exercise. Less intense exercise doesn't do as well, and resistance exercise results are uncertain. 

# If you don't use it, you lose it

This is a common joke punchline but it's very true with the benefits of exercise on insulin sensitivity. Regular exercise pays off greatly. But the increase in sensitivity drops away much faster than your fitness. Just two or three days, and your sensitivity drops. Not all the way, and you are always just one run away from those benefits. So, get out there 2-3 times a week -- that's all it takes."
"[F26 5'0 | 165 lbs -&gt; 120 lbs] I FLIPPIN DID IT!!! + PICS SW: 165 lbs GW: 120 lbs CW: 119 lbs (I'm not done yet, though ;))

Okay so 45 lbs (20.4 kg) isn't a whole lot compared to lots of you amazing folks, but it definitely shows on someone my height! I was at my heaviest in 2018 and absolutely hated myself. I had always been a tad overweight, but It shocked me how I just kept climbing and climbing.

I recall sitting in my car one night (alone and sad af) eating hella taco bell like I did basically every night, thinking to myself ""I will never, ***never*** change.""

Overall, I'd say I have been actively losing weight strictly for around 1.5 years. The journey has been incredibly slow, but I think that the fact that I have held steadfast on my weight loss through ALL the plateaus I hit, proves to me that I am capable of keeping this up for a *long* time. I am super fuckin proud of my progress and my body.

Awesome things that happened on my weight loss journey:

* I stopped ripping holes into all my jeans and leggings in my thigh area due to chub rub
* I know BMI doesn't mean much but I went from Obese &gt;&gt; Normal
* I lost almost 1/3 of my body weight
* I hit the weight 123.4 (heh)
* I saw my pelvic bones one day. I remember sitting in bed just moving my hips around in awe.
* I had a tendency to buy clothes that were too dang small for me. I started fitting into them!! then they got too big for me :( -- but really :)
* My flatter belly just keeps shocking me every time i look at myself in the mirror or sit down.
* I don't start wheezing when I do random normal shit
* I can see my collarbone
* Every time I lost weight after 140, I would announce to my friends, I'M tHe LoWeST I'Ve BeEn in 12 YeARS!!

Some info about what I do:

* I do CICO and eat 1100-1200 a day. I started with keto though!
* I sort of do OMAD (700-800 cal meals once a day)
* I weigh all my food, ALL OF IT
* I am conscious that the world is not portioning shit for a 5''0 female
* Avoid sugar where possible. Use sugar substitutes
* I didn't do any exercise (regrettably), but I am going to start soon and I have more stamina when I go out walking now for sure.
* I am patient. Plateaus happen.
* Recognize that weight loss is absolutely about lifestyle changes, not dieting.

Kinda weird showing so much of my body to strangers on the internet. Oh well, here you go, strangers!

Included is **NSFW pics!!!**, some SFW Pics, face gains, and a graph of the last 6 months of weight loss :)

"Attempt number 36. Something snapped in my head again and I am counting calories again. I have done it at least a dozen times in past 15 years. I count calories, I eat 1,200-1,400 (F, 5'5, pretty much sedentary, small build). I love the food I am eating, I am not doing any specific diets. I lose weight, end up at around 120, maintain for a few months by upping calories to around 1,600-1,800. 

And then some kind of switch gets flipped in my head and again I am eating everything that is not nailed in unlimited quantities until I gain back to 150 or so. I do not know how to explain it, but I. Just. Can't. Stop until the switch is flipped back on, and I am eating healthy and counting again. I have three sets of clothes that I rotate - for when I am 150, for when I am 120, and for when I am in process of losing or gaining.

What the hell is wrong with me? I have lost and gained same 30-40 pounds at least (AT LEAST) a dozen times. I have no mental health issues, I don't think I have an eating disorder. Only thing I can think of is that my mother was dieting permanently and made me fast or limited my food severely when I was 11-18 years old, but it's not something that keeps me up at night."
"Started taking Phentermine a few days ago So I started taking Phentermine for weight loss last week and so far haven't noticed much change on the scales however I have to say my concentration has become much better and I feel much happier going to work every day as I am much less stressed with the work. Today, I decided to not eat and see how long it takes me to become hungry as the drug is primarily to my understanding a stimulant and an appetite suppressant.   I have managed to get to 6pm without a meal quite comfortably (plenty of water) but I am considering eating something soon.  I am tempted to try  intermittent fasting on weekends. So my questions is has anyone had success intermittent fasting with phentermine and also did your ability to concentrate change?

Edit 7/3/21: 
Thanks for the replies, I see a lot of cautions and so I would like to elaborate on my situation. I am currently tracking and adapting my eating habits to increase my protein, fibrous carbohydrates, some additional fat and largely reduce my starchy carbohydrates although I do not plan to cut them completely. I strongly feel that despite what keto enthusiasts say it is beneficial and quite natural to have a low to moderate portion of carbs included in my diet and that this will be more sustainable in the long run.  Every meal I have eaten since taking the medication has been home cooked which I think is highly significant coming from eating junk food all day. I am planning my shopping days now to ensure I have food in the fridge at all times.  I am also working towards a caloric deficit of beneath 1800, that said, I have researched intermittent fasting and believe it could be greatly beneficial so long as my diet is also changed.  I'm not new to keto and have done it before but found it was unsustainable after about a month, I just craved a sandwich or a cracker, I feel this is what everyone who does it goes through but some can tolerate it more than others.  Note: I'm not knocking keto, if it works for you then great. I'm just saying its not a lifestyle choice I can cope with.

This week I have also joined a gym (did a weights session today which felt great) and plan to attend indoor cycling classes 3 times a week and doing weights twice a week.  I'm fully committed to tracking my caloric intake, macros, exercise and change my lifestyle completely. I'm ""All in"" as they say and I feel the phentermine is the ace up my sleeve.  As far as my mental health goes; I did have a lull the other day from being kept up a few hours at night from the medication but other than that I am generally feeling absolutely incredible; focused, happier, less stressed and looking forward to the future. In contrast, prior to taking phentermine, I was very easily distracted with my own thoughts and working  a highly technical role this made my job extremely stressful (which leads to more eating), actually it was like I constantly had other things to think about and I felt my work was the distraction, now its my focal point.  Anyway, to summarise; I am fully aware that a lifestyle change is needed to reduce my weight permanently (120kg btw).  I'm using phentermine on a temporary basis and as it was intended: to kick start my weight loss journey.

Thanks for your responses, wish me luck! All the best!"
"NSV: Feeling Positive and Resetting Expectations Hi fellow losers,

It's been a long and weird journey getting here, but I just wanted to share my feelings about health and weightloss and hopefully some of you can relate.

I have no incredible weight loss to report, in fact, I've been hovering up and down for several weeks now, but for the first time in my life when trying to lose weight, I haven't given up and I haven't been discouraged. I've never stuck with a lifestyle change long enough to understand what it is I need to do to succeed, when things hadn't gone my way in the past, I'd just give up and double-down to find I'd gained another 10+ pounds a few months later.

I have lost weight before - 75lbs! But I lost it by eating almost nothing and allowing myself to fall into an incredible depression that made starving myself an appealing type of self-punishment.

For this and other reasons, obviously I gained it all back. 

For over 2 months now, however, I've been on MFP and WW. I track most days, even on really bad days. I've had days where I don't track and weeks where I felt like giving up. I've gone from going on walks consistently to falling back into old sedentary habits, to walking consistently and then back again.

My point is, the process has been messy. It's been imperfect and inconstant. And yet, I've stuck to it.

Like a baby learning to walk, you have to crawl before you can run. I feel so good about just trying and failing and still fighting to get better at this everyday. Though my weight has gone up and down, I've maintained a 10lb loss overall from where I started, and as I get better and better at learning how to tailor my journey to my habits and goals, I can't wait to look back on this time with even more pride than I already feel now.

In my opinion, this is how you lose weight. Not by crash dieting and not by obsessively managing every aspect of your weight loss with overzealous perfectionism. You try. You fail. You try again."
"I'm at a complete loss. I'm in a horrible cycle. I want to exercise and eat right. I am a mom of a newly-turned 1 year old. His sleep is still shit. I'm exhausted. I want to work out, but I legitimately cannot find the time in the day. He is awake at 5:30 AM and goes to bed at like 8:00 PM. I don't know if this is permanent, but it's horrible. I cannot find time where I am energetic enough to exercise.

Then, I stress eat. I think me not working out gets to my head and I get stressed and then I eat because ""Why can't I eat things I enjoy if I can't work out?"" I'm also a terribly picky eater.

I just don't even know what to do. I'm not happy with my body, and I'm still 10 lbs over my pre baby weight"
"Anxious to start going to the gym for cardio only Hi! I’ve recently decided I want to lose some quarantine weight, but I’m having some expected anxiety since I haven’t been to a gym in years and am self conscious. 

My goal is a calorie deficit, and to move as much as possible so i burn fat, and I don’t really feel the need to do any other types of exercise. I’ve lost weight before by diet and cardio only so I’d be happy with just that. 

However, everyone is telling me it’s pointless to go to the gym just to burn calories since i can ~go for runs/do it all at home~. The thing is I’m very shy and would never go for a run outside. And to me it’s like trying to do homework in bed vs on your desk, which is intended for that purpose. I don’t know if this makes sense. 

I’m very scared of people staring at me or judging me. I know everyone is too preoccupied with themselves, but I’ve been made fun at the gym as a teen for not being able to do some exercise right, and I’ll never forget the embarrassment. Is it weird to just go have your “walks” on the treadmill and go, or is it a thing people do? I feel like I just need some words of encouragement tbh"
"54 lbs down, finally out of the obesity zone I weighted in at 320 lbs in June and I weigh 266 as of today. I'm inching closer and closer to my goal of 15% body fat (225). 

As I approach 245, I'm getting closer to the weight of my prime. I keep thinking that I'm going to surpass my former best version of myself (physically) in a matter of months. That thought makes me anxious because I don't know what's next. 

All of the loose skin has been rough for me, but it's better than staying the same physically. I'm taking all of the good and bad as just part of the weight loss process. A few things that I've changed are my skin care routine and putting effort into muscle recovery. I was feeling like shit for a while, but I bought a few new products and I started applying bio freeze to my calves and knees. My daily task of inclined walking has been less daunting and my legs feel recovered/fresh. 

Lastly, I treated myself to some new clothes. I can finally fit an XL! It's been almost 5/6 years. After I lose another 40+lbs,  I'll say hello to Mr Medium. I haven't seen him since 2013."
"Weightloss Jan-2020 to March 2021 CW 210, SW: 257 

Last year I was [unhealthy](https://i.imgur.com/YeRHOgq.png), 257 pounds at my heaviest.  I had to walk in deep snow for about 10 meters and I couldn't see how I'd get back to the street.. I was so out of breath.. I understand then and there I could'nt see my daughters grow up if I was in that shape (cardiac issue are in my family) .

So after a year training with a basic set of dumbells (15 pounds) and doing insanity t-25 as well as CICO.  I was able to lose 55 pounds. 

Cut all alchool, lower the bread intake, raise the fruits and veggies and smaller portions. working out 3-5 days a week (5 days with t-25 but otherwise it was 3 days a week) .

I feel pretty good about [myself](https://i.imgur.com/mLyFVmq.jpg)... only 10 pounds to go."
"Switched to a healthier diet but feeling unnecessary amount of hunger all day So I switched to a rice and chicken/salmon diet with normal breakfast of eggs and fruits. Basically I cut it to what I liked and can survive on and had breakfast be my normal meals while dinner and lunch become based on just what I needed for calorie reasons. 

I lost like 2 pounds a week. But I was just feeling hungry. Like I used to eat this much before this year and before the slight weight gain so I know that it’s my true norm. But my body has just gotten used to the massive amount of calories and fighting me along the way.  

How do you push past this adjustment from a massive calorie diet to a medium amount of calorie diet?"
"Nearly 5 years after successful weight loss and we’re back on the grind Starting weight: 270 lbs approx. 

Lowest weight: 153 lbs 

Current weight: 192 lbs 

Goal weight: 155-160 lbs 

https://imgur.com/hbMNQh5

Not the usual progress pictures you’d expect but I promise this ends on a cheerful note :) 

I had lost about 115 pounds nearly 5 years ago and I was pretty good at keeping the extra pounds off but then life happened and I gained 40 lbs back (15 of those in the last year thanks to the pandemic). 

Quite frankly I was beating myself up over it up until recently, wondering how did I let myself get back here again but something in me finally sparked and I’m back on the weight loss train again. If I was able to lose over one hundred pounds before I can totally get these 40 pounds off again! So I downloaded MFP, I’m tracking everything closely and not only I’ve already lost 2 pounds but I’m starting to feel less bloated. It’s all so encouraging. 

Sure it kinda sucks I have to do this again but that’s life for ya. It’s not all linear. As long as you remember to get back up and try again, you’re already a winner. Knowing I’ve succeeded before and trusting the calorie deficit gives me so much confidence I’ll get back to where I was 5 years ago. Every day I stay on track is a day closer I get to my goal and that alone is a victory in itself. 

Thank you all on this reddit for continuing to be so inspirational and motivating. Here’s to hoping I’ll make a new post in a couple of months where I’ve reached my goal weight again!"
"How accurate is Samsung Health's measure of burned calories? Something must be wildly off. I'm a custodian so I'm on my feet for 5-8 hours a night, I get between 15k-20k steps a day plus a weekend job pointing a 40 lb dry ice blasting gun at stuff for hours on end, and I've been using Samsung health to track my caloric intake, between 1600-1800 calories a day with 3 cheat days (2000-2300cal) total since the start of the year. Samsung Health has been reporting my burned calories as between 2600-3000 calories a day. Thing is, I dropped about 13 lbs within the first two weeks of calorie restriction, but after that I haven't lost a single pound. 

I admit to some cheating and at the beginning I wasn't counting little things like the milk in my coffee, but I'm tracking every grain of rice and drop of liquid that goes in me now. Have I plateaued? Is there an interregnum between starting calorie restriction and consistently losing weight? Does it happen   
in fits and starts or a sort of continuous line? Does TDEE drop with calorie restriction? Is the TDEE and calories burned in Samsung health wildly above what I'm actually burning? If my app is crap, what health app has a more accurate measure of burned calories?"
"Scared of the scale? I've been working really hard tracking my calories, eating better and pushing through my exercises. After 2 weeks I could already tell a difference in my butt and stamina from my workouts which is great, but im so scared to look at a scale and I know its holding me back from being able to accurately track my progress. I weighed myself last time around 2 months ago and I was around the 175 area, but I also know I've maybe put on like 5 lbs since. I just feel like looking at the scale is going to cause me to obsess over it and last time that happened I almost developed an eating disorder. Has anyone else gone through this before? How did you get over that fear of seeing the numbers?"
"Thoughts on losing weight with my mental illnesses (TW?) Possible trigger warning: mentions of eating disorders

I'm mostly writing this out as a kind of journal entry, but I'm very open to advice or comments!

So I'm a 5 ft, 28 year old woman currently weighing 227 lbs. I, like many people in this sub, have struggled with my weight since I was a child. I've tried just about everything and have almost never had any success except for one time when I was ~21. I've been diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), depression, and OCD. I have also been diagnosed with BED (Binge Eating Disorder), and nearly diagnosed with Anorexia. The near diagnosis of Anorexia stemmed from losing 40 lbs in 3 months when I was ~21. I went from ~220 lbs to ~180 lbs, I hit a plateau and saw my primary to see what I could do to break through it. Initially she complimented my weight loss, but upon hearing about how quickly I lost the weight, how strict I was being, and how triggered my OCD was, she said I was in danger of becoming anorexic. She decided not to officially diagnosis me though for some reason. This shock coupled with the plateau, caused me to crash hard and I have not been able to stay on track for more than a month ever since.

I want so badly to lose weight and be healthy. Losing the weight means the possibility of lessening chronic pain I've had since I was 12 years old (no guarantee as the pain is not weight related, but weight loss *could* help ease the pain). Despite the want, I'm terrified. I don't want to become obsessed again. I started out with 1200 calories/day, but quickly dropped down to 900/day. I was eating half a cup of cereal and milk for breakfasts, a cup of soup or a small salad for lunches, and tiny portions of whatever my parents had made for dinner. I refused to eat anything I didn't know the nutritional info on. I was weighing myself multiple times a day, especially in the morning before and after using the bathroom. My mom ended up hiding the bathroom scale on me and only letting me use it once a week. I was basically hibernating during those 3 months. I slept nearly all day and night and only woke up to use the bathroom and eat. 

I wish I could find some middle ground, but I've tried repeatedly to have some kind of willpower and use moderation but I simply cannot do it. I guess I'm just an all or nothing kind of person. I also have terrible, terrible cravings. If I'm craving something, I have obsessive thoughts about it. I can't stop thinking about it until I have it. I hate to say it, but I even kind of get depressed when I dwell on my cravings. I'm also an incredibly picky eater, so finding healthy things that I **do** like is a bit of a challenge.

On the bright side, now that I live alone, if I don't buy it, I don't have it. I do my best during my weekly grocery shop to not buy junk food. I'm entirely too lazy to drive to the store for one package of Oreos, and I'm far too cheap to pay for delivery. I haven't drank soda (diet, thanks to growing up with a diabetic mom, I'm used to diet and sugar free things) regularly in years, I don't like coffee, I don't cook meat often (just seems like a lot of work for one person), and I recently made the change to almond milk. I do have a pretty active little dog and we go for 20-40 minute walks (time depending on my pain level and weather) 3-4 times a day. I've made some small changes over the years which is nice, but every time I really try to be healthier and still have ""bad"" food in moderation, I end up going off the rails quickly, crashing, and restarting.

I'm so tired of this rinse and repeat cycle I'm in. Maybe it's worth letting the OCD take over and becoming obsessed again, as long as I'm aware of it? Sometimes I just wish I had no choices and could only eat what someone chose for me. Maybe surgery is worth looking into? I don't know. For those wondering, yes, throughout the years I have seen many nutritionists, dieticians, my mom's diabetes doctor (I'm not pre-diabetic but my mom thought she might have some insight), my primary, psychiatrists, and therapists. I've also been a part of a few weight loss support groups as well as a chronic pain support group. Nothing sticks with me for long.

I feel like my thoughts and feelings are a little bit more in order after writing this. I'm probably gonna delete it in a few hours but it was helpful to get it out.

If anyone reads and has suggestions, feel free!"
"Talking to my doc about phentramine next week I’ve been on this weight loss journey for 1 year now with no budging in my weight at all. No gaining luckily, but absolutely no weight loss. I have PCOS and Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis which doesn’t help at all, and I’m on metformin and birth control to deal with the insulin resistance. I’ve been seeing a dietician for a year (two dieticians, one was horrible) and my last resort is to try phentramine. I’ve heard it can induce anxiety and depression (which I already deal with and is managed medically) which is worrisome, but my main concern is what happens after I finish the short of treatment. How do I keep the weight off? I already exercise 6 days a week and my diet is pretty good (not perfect, but not horrible) but I just want to be sure this works and my habits are healthy enough to sustain the lower weight. Looking to lose about 30lbs"
"tdee feels too high hi all, i'm a 19 year old female and *kind of* starting my weight loss journey. i say kind of because i've yoyo-ed between periods of weight loss and weight gain since i was 12, with my highest weight being 275 at 13 and my lowest weight being about 210 at 16. a lot of this was due to disordered eating and easier weight gain due to pcos, going between periods of bingeing and self starvation with no consistent exercise. i just moved to college and have regular access to a gym for the first time and am trying to take full advantage of it, and i don't keep food in my room (other than a few snacks) to control bingeing and only get food from the dining hall which has pretty healthy options. 

so i am 19, 5'7"", and about 235 pounds, and according to [this calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/), my tdee is 2,900 for my current exercise level, which is moderate (hard cardio for 40 minutes 4 times a week). subtracting 500 calories for a deficit leaves me at 2,400. this still feels WAY too high. i started ADHD medication that has made my appetite decrease, and if i eat around 1,800 for the day i feel really full and i have trouble imagining eating more for the day. i also realize that if i don't eat enough/rest enough it will only be damaging in the long run. having pcos makes this equation more difficult as there's a lot of conflicting information on whether it impacts BMR or not. 

since my weight has fluctuated so much i'm honestly also just scared of intentionally eating 2,400 calories for the day even if i'm more active than i've ever been and i put in good work at the gym. i just have trouble trusting this number and trusting the process in general. if anyone has been in this spot before and has any advice, it would be GREATLY appreciated."
"[ADVICE NEEDED] Serious weight loss advice for myself Current status- 203lbs/5ft7in/21yrs/M

(Sorry for my bad English in advance, not a native speaker)

I started going to gym 2 years ago when my weight was 192 lbs and initially I lost considerable amount of weight(15lbs) in a month doing cardio mostly and was on my way towards my goal, but i became overconfident and acquired bad eating habits that resulted in nullification of all my hard work, as a result of demotivation i quit gym. My situation worsened and i gained even more weight, again i said enough is enough and joined the gym, this time i weighed 196 lbs, did everything right but results were not visible like last time even in two months, i became demotivated again and started eating junk foods (worth 1500 calories at a time) at an alarming rate, all the constraints  that i had put  (no sugar, no carbs ) over my diet became nonexistent, all this combined with my grandfather's recent death lead me to serious depression and i became mentally unstable for more than 5 months where i had no control over my life, i am in college so my grades were also affected.

But from last 2 months, i am taking my life seriously and this time i want to make things right for sure. I have been reading few self help books lately and one thing that i have learned from them is that no war is won without a proper strategy. All those time where i spent hours in gym sweating and going hard on myself resulted in nothing because my strategy was poor and non-existent, my diet was shit and my discipline was a joke.  Hence this time i am asking for your advice, any advice or strategy regarding diet, exercise, discipline or anything that you can give to this amateur to help in his weight loss journey. Please."
"Where do I start?/ Am I doing alright so far? Today I (21F) weighed myself and turns out I’m 80.5kg (~176lbs). I’m the biggest I’ve ever been in my life.

A little bit of a background: The entire month of February I started watching my calories and started eating healthier too. The entire time I just assumed I was 70kgs because that’s how much I remembered weighing in a few months prior. I never realized I was that much bigger. I was so proud of my progress the whole February until I saw I was actually 80.5kgs.

Some questions: As mentioned in the title, how should I get my progress started? I’ve been recommending to try a Chloe Ting challenge, should I start with something like that? My average caloric intake throughout February was around 1100, some days I only eat a bowl of cereal when I wake and nothing else, is that bad or can I keep that going?

"feeling a little discouraged (CW: 135 goal: maintain for 6 more weeks, then 130) stats:
sex: F
Height: 5'2.5""
Age: 22

hey everyone! I'm new to this subreddit, but I've been using the LoseIt! calorie tracker app on and off since I was in sixth grade (I'm 22 now, so 12.5 years. I was obese as a kid). 
I'm about halfway through a 5day a week strongman/muscle building lifting plan, full body 4 days a week, upper body on the 5th. My appetite has SKYROCKETED and I'm honestly amazed I managed to maintain a tight 133 for the first three weeks. Since Valentine's Day, though, my weight has jumped up to 135. And while I know gaining weight is expected, given I genuinely want to increase strength on this plan, I'm seriously worried for the last six weeks of it. I came home from college last March and lost ~7 lbs pretty easily (yeah our dining hall food is NOT easy to lose weight on, and I valued comfort foods a little too much). I'm worried I'm going to go back to my pre covid weight (~140) instead of lose these last 5 lbs. I've wanted to weigh 130 for four years now, and I'm so close I can taste it. 
I guess I wanted to introduce myself, and let some stuff off my chest, and see if you guys had  tips on losing the last little bit. I've gotten my maintenance calories to 2200 (more if i accidentally eat low carb but that's just bc water weight) so I sometimes feel very sad on 1800 as a slight deficit. I know it's very very doable, so I've been feeling discouraged I can't even stick to that.
Thanks so much in advance❤️

"Nook calories too low? So I downloaded noom today on a trial because I keep hearing good things. Went through all the questions and got my calorie count for the day...it's only 1200? For reference I'm a 30 year old female, 5'10"" and I currently weigh between 173-176 with fluctuations. I workout at least 3-4 times a week for about 30-40 minutes a day and it's a mix of weight lifting and HITT usually depending on the day. I have a sedentary desk job and try and walk about 45-60 minutes a day but I don't always get it in.

Am I crazy or is 1200 way too low?!? I want to be around 145lbs if possible and finally feel good in my body (numbers arent a big deal if I can build muscle to get to a place I feel confident so 145 is a number goal but I won't be sad if I don't reach that as long as I feel confident in my body). Most of my weight I carry around my mid section everywhere else is honestly pretty lean.

"Calculating TDEE Hi!
I’ve been struggling with my weight practically my whole life. I’ve never been classified as morbidly obese, I also have a lot of muscle mass so I don’t look like I ,,have” to lose 20 kilos. However, lately I’ve been feeling really heavy, which is sad since im only 21 years old. I decided it’s time to finally lose that excess weight I have an start eating healthy. I’m not looking for a quick, one week diet to, but rather a change in lifestyle. When reading a post on this topic I ran across a TDEE calculator and decided to try it to. By its calculations I should be consuming around 1.800 calories in order to lose weight. Considering I’m a 163 cm, 78 kg, 21 yr old female and I run 3 times a week for 30-40 minutes, (and i burn approximately 400ish calories with each run) do those calculation sound right?"
"Why am I cold? Before weight loss I ran extremely cold. I live in Colorado so winter wasn’t always the most enjoyable for me, but now after losing weight, it’s a different kind of cold. For example, today it’s nearly 60 degrees, I’m inside a heated building, and it’s uncomfortable without my jacket. 

It’s a different type of cold. It almost feels like when you have the flu or something and your skin feels like flushed? It’s not painful or unbearable, and I don’t have any sickness or anything out of the ordinary going on besides that. Is there a reason why this is happening? Maybe a deficiency? 

I drink a gallon of water a day, eat 1500 cals, and workout out regularly. 

I’m 124 lbs, 5’2 and trying to lose a little bit more fat on my body. I’m considering going into maintenance calories because all I’m struggling with is losing belly fat. Everywhere else is relatively where I want it to be.."
"I'm making some progress...but I'm also making no progress tl;dr below  


Hi all,

It's been a weird week for me. Since 24th Jan 2021 (when I hit my lowest weight in my weight loss journey) when I got to 285lbs (started at 314lbs) I have lost no weight at all. instead I have gained, lost, gained, lost, gained, lost....and so on forth. I have been BATTLING with myself to keep to my diet but I keep on losing to my other self. the less disciplined self, the less caring self, the less healthy less, the greedy self, the self who is so scared to lose weight so much so that she sabotages herself, self.

since Jan 24th I have basically been binging, making myself sick, tasting then spitting out food and overeating....it feels so shameful to write this all out. I feel ashamed. but I also feel kinda relieved...? I feel relieved I can admit these things, I can recognise they are wrong and I realise this want within myself to want to change them too. 

so since jan 24th I have basically been ruining all the progress I made then losing weight and repeat. but this week was a lil different.

I posted a week ago about a really bad period which also made me gain a ton (like 10lbs almost) of weight....this week I resolved to not be hard on myself (my hormones are messed up, im on week 3 of my period and in process of getting this checked out now because enough is enough). I have been walking a ton more, eating more balanced, did not make myself vomit even when I kept thinking about it, I did spit out some chocolate once but once I did I decided to just get rid of the chocolate all together, and I have been successfully drinking a ton of water daily. I have been monitoring my weight everyday and it is going down, I know a lot of this water weight from my period but it is still satisfying nevertheless.

my period is making me want to eat sooo much more, so I am (not by a huge margin,I am still in a deficit). right now my period is really messed up and it is messing up my eating/hunger too but instead of dwelling over it and becoming depressed like I have been the previous 2 weeks ive just decided to eat and then quite literally walk it off. I am still in a deficit. today I went a 1000 calories over (past deficit) and I really wanted to make myself sick but I decided I would instead go on a loooooong walk/mini hike tomorrow to burn it off and start afresh (again). 

im not perfect and ive stopped trying to be. I'm tired guys.

weight loss is one of the hardest things I think I have ever tried to do. I keep failing myself but now instead of concentrating on the fails I want to focus on the picking myself back up and doing better for myself. I literally prayed to God before posting this to help me keep in a calorie deficit tomorrow and to help my balance out my over eating today.... (I feel like im in this same constant mistake making loop)

I don't know what exactly I expect in a response here...I know a lot of this is self-destructive behaviour and points to a lot of issues with food...I have had therapy before but I keep making the same mistakes and I kinda don't know what to do to stop doing it. so I guess im sharing here to just get it off my chest. I know the mistakes I am making and how to avoid them/fix them but there is SOMETHING inside me which doesn't allow me to. is it the fear? I have a fear that ill loose weight and still won't love my physical self or still won't find love or happiness... I don't know. but I do know I am tired. I sooooo tired of this. I want progress, not negative and useless repetition.

I have to talk to my dietician on Monday and I am SCARED. I am DREADING it cos I feel emabarressed and ashamed to admit all the above. I was going to lie, quite honestly. but what good will that do? im scared to tell her all this. I am really scared, ashamed and embarrassed of myself. but at this point I feel like I almost deserve to have that feeling after how I treat myself. I feel so hopeless sometimes!

tl;dr: anyway, if you made it this far, I am tired of repeating the same stupid mistakes and I wish I had a magic potion to fix myself and my weight-related problems. I just don't know how to find that inner discipline. :("
"Honestly the worst thing about weight loss is that it is just so damn boring .. I mean, you want it to be exciting, you jump up like it is your birthday, weigh yourself, plan out your meals, eat a little something, record your weight ..

Yeah and then that's pretty much it for 24 hours.

I don't even know how many times I've graphed the same weight loss, looking at patterns, being all excited because of another quarter pound, .. but it is like waiting with excitement for Christmas to come, except it is March and Christmas doesn't come until December.

I'm old enough that I know better than to wish time away, but when you are on CICO and you are eating at a deficit, and you know at the end of the rainbow you'll move back up to maintenance, you kind of wouldn't mind getting there ..

Even the setbacks are boring.

It's like watching paint dry.  Or .. more like watching dried paint get old and flake off, one little piece at a time, bit by bit .. s l o w l y ... o v e r ... t i m e ...

It.  is.  so.  bore.  ing.

\*\*leans back and stares at the ceiling\*\*

Yet it is the consistency, the day to day grind that does the job .. it ain't rocket science.  It is just doing the same.  boring.  thing.  every.  single.  day."
"When will I plateau? Does cutting your calories too much too soon hurt? My TDEE is 2100, and so a 500-calorie deficit would be 1600. I also exercise every day and burn about 700-800 calories (according to my Apple Watch, so taking that with a grain of salt). I’ve been eating 1400-1500 calories per day, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less. But even assuming my Apple Watch is off by 50 percent, that’s still well over a 1000 calorie deficit per day. The only problem is the weight is falling off BEAUTIFULLY. I would love to keep this going. But will it screw me over in a month if I plateau? I don’t know if I could maintain 1200 calories a day, I might start binging again. So would it be better for me to up my calories a bit now so there’s more wiggle room down the line, or should I stay the course since I’m seeing the results I want now?

EDIT: I’m f22, SW246, CW230, GW150"
"Exercise similar to walking while quarantined Hi everyone! So, in the last month or so I have been actively walking 15k steps a day and trying to eat better. I’ve managed to lose 2 kilos. I don’t have so much to lose, so it’s great for me! However, I’m about to travel back to my home country where I will have to quarantine for two weeks in an apartment and will only be allowed into a small garden. 
Does anyone have any tips for quarantined exercise? I know there are thousands of YouTube videos I can watch, the problem is that I am lazy and walking around a city was an easy way to get some exercise in. 
Any tips on workouts that are fun? 
At least diet shouldn’t be too bad, as I can control only having access to healthy food."
"Wondering what your cardio/resistance training ratio sweet spot is? I'm figuring that this is highly personal, but what cardio/resistance training (if you do both) ratio worked for you when you found that you were really dropping the weight/inches? What kind of workouts are/were you doing and what's the breakdown like, say, in a week? What made it sustainable for you? What is/was your hunger/appetite like when doing your workout sweet spot ratio? 

Oh, and yes, this is assuming that you have nutrition in check. :) 

I'm just curious as I'm in the process of fine-tuning my workout program. For a year or so, I've just been trying to get two days of resistance training (both full-body, spaced out within the week), with two to three days of cardio (swimming, running, spinning) in a week. Right now, I'm wondering whether to adjust it, like, more resistance training, or more cardio. I'll definitely be researching more about it as I finetune my fitness goals as well (like, not just considering weight loss but what I want to achieve with my body, strength/skills-wise too.) But I'm just really curious about what everyone who already has reasonable skin in the game (aka have already been working out for a while) thinks/does.

Hope I'm making sense, English isn't my first language. Hi!"
"Trying to start, again So as I’m sure it has for most people, the pandemic hit me hard. I’m a 27M and I weigh around 400 lbs. I’ve gone through about 3-4 weight loss spurts where I’ve lost 20-30 lbs and then stop as I’m sure others do the same. With everything opening up again, me getting vaccinated, and the summer coming, I really want to lose weight again but man my motivation is just not there. Whenever I have started to lose weight before there’s always this burst of energy and I really get pumped but it always fizzles as I’m sure most of you have felt the same way. I don’t even have this feeling again of being incredibly motivated but I have felt myself slipping into old bad habits harder than before. Eating candy, drinking soda, etc. I feel like I eat like I’m still 15 sometimes and the realization of getting older and weight loss becoming harder has mentally sent me to a place where I feel this is obviously something I need to do. I don’t want to be this weight, I shouldn’t be this weight, and it feels more and more unhealthy by the day.

For some context: I’ve always been a “big guy” and of course have used that as an excuse for myself. More than that, I’ve always been “athletic” even for my build. I played a lot of sports and even on my last stint of working out, I was able to do about 25 push-ups at 385lbs which I know isn’t necessarily ordinary so I have used that excuse as a reason to stay unhealthy. Here’s the thing; I like working out. I like feeling strong. I like getting stronger. I like how I feel when I eat healthier. I like how I feel when I drink an appropriate amount of water throughout the day. But all of this feels so hard when I’ve been treating my body like trash for so long. I want to change but man do I feel hopeless and like it’ll never be enough. It always feels like I’ll be back at square one.  I have the tools, I just never use them. I know how to count calories, how to use my TDEE, how to form a workout plan that I can sustain. I feel like I just lack the discipline and willpower to stay committed. I know it may never come and I might be better off just doing it because that just might be the best thing for me. I have other mental health issues and I definitely have an “addictive personality” in which I get really involved with activities and then stop them when I get bored. I guess I’m posting this for accountability, support, and advice. 

A good quote for anyone looking for inspiration and what I’m telling myself right now from one of my favorite books is: “The most important step a man can take. It's not the first one, is it? 
It's the next one. Always the next step, Dalinar” -Brandon Sanderson, Oathbringer.

So this is me, taking my next step, and looking to take many more. Please if you have any advice or words of encouragement I could really use them right now. Thank you so much and I hope to become a more active member in this wonderful community."
"I Hurt My Relationship With Food Hello everyone

I just want to warn that I will be bringing up details of an ED that I developed during my weight loss journey. My main purpose of posting this is to ask for help and advice on what to do now.

I have posted on this sub before about how I was struggling to cope with my body changing and accepting that I am no longer as big as I was. I started my journey at 250lbs and these days I have been swinging between 165lbs-170lbs (about 5 months). I reached the 160s quickly because I started heavy restriction when I got stuck at 175lbs. During the restriction I also increased my daily steps dramatically. To give an idea of my day: consuming under 1000 cal, burning 80% of it by walking. I am 5'6 F in my early 20s.

This has obviously brought me to where I am now. Struggling to make any progress, mental health declining, afraid of food, and worried about gaining too much weight trying to fix my metabolism.

I don't know where to go from here. If anyone has reassuring words or advice to provide, I will listen. I just want to get back on track and feel good again."
"This Week Wasn’t Going Well Until I Thought I Looked Hot I’m currently about 145 lbs and started at 155 in early December. I’m 5’ 2” and female. 

So I was feeling pretty discouraged because my weight loss has been pretty slow in general mostly because I just can’t do the high deficit thing anymore. I don’t know, I’m just tired of being hungry, demonizing food, getting obsessive. So my only goal now is to eat below 1700 and even then I probably have a day a week I go over, but I usually average out between 1400-1600 cals a day per week. And yes and you can see, I lose a few pounds a month. 

I’ve been working out just to be able to eat more food and get some strength because I’m also tired of needing people to help me carry everything. I’ve been doing some Beachbody programs (Barre Blend and now I’m on LIIFT4). I would do a 5k on one or two of the off days just because I really like running. 

Anyways, so lots of NSV like building a better relationship with food, getting buff, better balance, and more endurance. But sometimes instead of seeing the 10 lbs I’ve lost, I just feel the 25-35 lbs weighing down on me. I don’t know why, but I just felt heavy this week. It messed up my run Wednesday because all I could think of is “you have to drag this fat body up the hill with you.” Like whoa, I thought we were past that? Where did that come from? 

But today, I was dancing to some music I discovered (Mother by Danzig if you’re interested) and I felt kind of hot! Like I was checking myself out and finally like it clicked. I have been doing measurements, but I was only focusing on how my boobs and ass shrunk. But my stomach is flatter. Still some fat there, but it doesn’t just hang out anymore. And I can get low! Like reeeeal low. A lot more flexible too. 

It was a good feeling and a nice reminder that I am doing the right thing and making the right changes. It might be slow, but the key is to find those good moments on the way down. Sorry for the hokey moral, but I feel like I can never end a post without an upside 👍"
"Reduce bust size exercise? So I (28f) 5’ 4” have been doing good with my weight loss, sub-stainable not crash diet. Lost 30lbs the past year going from 230 to 200lb through healthy diet and  exercise. However in May I shall be in a wedding not being at my goal weight isn’t the problem I’ve been in weddings as a plus size it doesn’t bother me. THE PROBLEM the bridesmaid dresses run small in the bust, I tried on my size dress yesterday and NO WAY will it do, so I ordered the next size up. It’s still going to be tight :/ (for reference I’m a 38D bust), and there’s no sizes after this (there are plus size options but they are in slightly different color shades, and I’d like to stay in the current color shade, bride is very understanding though). SO are there any exercises that are proven to help reduce the chest area?!? Just so I’m more comfortable in May 15th? I already exercise regularly and any suggestions I’d love to work in my rotation!"
"Just a rant about counting calories and my body Hey folks. 

I had an ED a few years ago. Dropped from a BMI of 20 to about 16 (I guess 120 lbs —&gt; 80 lbs) and then gained it back in a long, tearful, gruelling process.

My life was in shambles when my ED started. As my life resolved, I had more time to fix my ED and focus on the things and people I loved: school, my friends, my family (after we sorted out some issues), running, art, etc. In fact, I achieved my dream of getting into med school at 20!

And now I have my ED mostly under wraps. I live alone so there’s a lot of liberty with how I eat (i.e. meal times and no one can scold me for missing meals etc.)

I’ve recently been a little dissatisfied with my body. Just wanting to trim a little here and there. So I got MyFitnessPal again.

It made me so sad. And so guilty. And I realized I eat way more than I thought I did. 

Everyone tells me I look the same, or that I’ve put on more muscle from running since I have increased my distances. I feel like it’s all fat though. Sigh.

Anyways I’m sorry that was nothing productive. 4 days of counting calories and I just cannot do it."
"How do I deal with my SO not taking weight loss seriously which is putting our relationship at risk? I've been with my boyfriend for five years. I developed an eating disorder early on in our relationship and he picked up on my bad habits. Ultimately I gained around 50-60lbs and he gained around 150lbs. 

This has absolutely destroyed his self esteem and increased his anxiety tenfold. He refuses to meet my family because he is not ""his best"". I am wanting to get engaged soon but I will not allow that to happen until he meets them. My graduation is also coming up at the end of summer and I know if he does not lose a significant amount of weight by then that he will not go. Meaning he will miss one of the most important moments of my life... that essentially could lead to our relationship ending. 

We have both lost some weight and put it back on a few different times. This tims I am completely serious about making sure I am in a calorie deficit each day and so far I have lost 17lbs. 

However, he doesn't seem to be losing at all really. I try to make him more filling lower calorie meals. Obviously it is not good enough though. He tends to be ""hungry"" again right after dinner and then again late at night. This is when I feel he over eats. I do not keep junk in the house, yet he still manages to consume too many calories throughout the day with his snacks. 

I'm at the point of feeling resentful towards him for not taking this seriously, especially when he knows our relationship is at stake. He may need professional help but he refuses to admit he has a problem. I want to just say screw it and let it go and keep working on myself but I can't help but think I'm wasting time. 

What advice do you all have for me?

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I do not care what his weight is. I love him now more than when we met, regardless of the big difference in weight. That's not the reason the relationship wouldn't last, him not meeting my family and not being able to do things due to his weight would."
"Consumption I have been pondering this for a while, but I think there is definitely some correlation between food excess and other consumption requirements.


Freud is most famous for speaking about oral fixation, the link to food, drink, smoking and satisfaction. I wonder if it goes past that to any sort of consumption satisfaction.


Deep breathing for example.  Potentially caused by things like exercise, or even smoking.


I raise it here because there does seem to some abity to satisfy initial cravings with alternatives. I. E. Many people can numb a hunger cue with drinking water.

Wondered if there were other ""consumptions"" that people found satisfy what would normally be a calorific cue?"
"LoseIt DNA Report - Accurate? 25F 5'5 SW : 161, CW : 131, GW : Between 125-130

Hi all! I just found out that you can link your DNA Report (Ancestry, 23andMe, etc) to LoseIt and it can give you recommendations based on your genetic traits. How accurate is this? Can you really tell if someone should be eating more high carb/low fat vs. high fat/low carb just based on their genes? LoseIt recommends 15-25% fat calories and 55-65% carb calories for my ratios based on DNA traits. 

Some background if interested : I have been plateaued for a few months now but eating more towards maintenance and working out much more. I am not unhappy where I am at but would love to continue to lose fat and tone up. My macros were 120P / 153C / 58F but after reading this report should I adjust to 120P / 210C / 39F?"
"Just need to yell into the void I had been feeling pretty good lately, borderline arrogant on reflecting back how relatively easy the process has been for me. The universe decided to slam me back down to reality recently. Maybe I needed some humbling. 

I had a pretty bad binge nearly 2 weeks ago causing 4 lbs of weight gain and about a week to undo what I had done. No problem, it’s happened before I’ll learn from it move on and accept my setback. Today not even a week after I got back down to pre binge weight I did it again probably worse than before. 

Now I’m sitting here feeling physically and mentally awful. The only thing I can do is reset and get right back into it but this one hit different. This is the first time in nearly 10 months I’ve felt this defeated. i feel like I’m fighting a ghost. I don’t know what triggered it or how to fix it or how to prevent it from happening again. I know I’m not going to give up, I’ve come too far but damn if I wasn’t the closest I’ve ever been today. I’ve had this thought in the back of my head that all it will take is one bad day and boy did today feel like that day."
"I’ve found an easy route to weight loss I needed to lose 20 pounds and started on January 1 with a plan that I’ve found remarkably easy, I thought I would share in case it helps others. So far I’ve lost 16 pounds so will hit my goal in the next few weeks.  

- I start the day with 2 low calorie protein shakes (200 calories in total with 3 pints of water), makes me feel full till 10am when I eat breakfast. 

- Breakfast is porridge oats which keeps me going till 1pm, coming in around 150 calories as I have a small portion with water

- Lunch is a soup, a whole meal thin with butter and one square of dark chocolate,  coming around 400 calories 

- I walk for 60 minutes as quickly as I can in the afternoon at some point, I get out of breath, my Apple Watch says I’m doing about 50 mins of exercise out of my total 60 mins walking, I have 2 pints of water when I get back 

- In the afternoon at some point I eat kefir as a snack which is good for my gut, I also have 2 pints of water and feel full (around 150 calories)

- I eat dinner around 6pm and it’s made up of a big bag of kale or similar with a spicy sauce, jalapeños, peppers and what ever else looks like flavour, and I mix in some chopped small amounts chicken, fish or nut roast with the kale in a wok, so I have a huge portion, covers the whole plate of spicy, tasty greens with 2 pints of water with 1 square of dark chocolate (this is around 400 calories)

- I gave up alcohol and found a low calorie, non alcohol beer I liked. Took me a while but I found Brooklyn which I really like and is less than 80 calories. 

- I do 30 mins of weights every other evening while watching the tv. I have a fold up weight bench and dumbbells, and I do a simple routine for my shoulders, chest, thighs and arms. Sorry I know I’m focusing on my mirror muscles! 

- Before bed I have a 1 scoop (100 calorie protein shake) 

So I eat about 1500 to 1700 calories per day, the walking burns around 300 calories and the weights about the same. My fitness pal and my watch tells I’m in deficit by between 400 and 700 calories per day. 

All the food is easy and quick to prepare, available at my local store (which I walk to every day to help with my steps), and at no point do I ever feel hungry. Clearly the water really helps with feeling full. 

Downsides 
1. I wake up to pee in the night! 
2. I have had some constipation so have added a syrup of figs into my morning routine

Upsides 
1. I’m nearly 50 and feel great, I’ve had to buy some new trousers and enjoy wearing clothes again. 

I honestly believe my fitness pal recording everything I eat, my Apple Watch recording all my exercise and lots of water is the key to this. 

Best of luck, I’ve wanted to do this for 2 decades and lock down has finally given me the time and motivation to do this."
"NSV: I can turn my head back without pain! This is pretty insignificant compared to other NSV’s I see here lmao but I’ve never lost weight before in my life, so it’s a milestone! Anyw, I’ve been eating ~1200 cal a day for almost 4 weeks now, and even though it’s kind of disappointing that I’m not losing fat in my stomach just yet, apparently I am from my neck. It usually hurt me to twist my head backwards bc my neck fat would be pressed heavily against, but I just noticed about 10 min ago in the shower that it didn’t feel painful at all! It’s so surreal that I’m beginning to wonder if I ever felt pain doing it in the first place even though I *clearly* remember the pain and shame in myself for letting myself get that way. 

And now I’m looking like a madwoman because I’m repeatedly moving my head backwards like some demon possessed because I’m still in awe at the lack of fat. I feel like that girl who walked with her body upside down downstairs lol. Now that I’ve had my first actual victory ever I finally knows what it feels like to be truly motivated to keep going. I used to get jealous of all the people who actually saw results while I still looked like a potato. 

I still wish it didn’t take me 19 years to do something small like this but it’s never to late :p"
"Complete beginner trying something different - can you validate my approach? M/26/5ft8/185lbs

I am a man who's weight fluctuates a lot... Typically my cycle goes..

1. Go from about 165lbs to 180lbs
2. Do keto for 45 days
3. Back to 165lbs
4. Repeat

This has happened about 3 times; this time I weighed myself and I was 195lbs and realized that my usual approach was not ideal, and I'd like to keep it off.

I don't have the commitment to stick to a schedule, or a particular diet, I also hate cooking and my job/hobbies both involve me sitting at a desk.

So, this time I bought a Fitbit (charge 4), paid for premium and Fitbit Coach, and also paid for MyFitnessPal. 

My new routine is simply:

- Calorie goal of 1450 (Macros below, but I dont follow these strictly at all)
 - Carbs: 181g
 - Fat: 48g
 - Protein: 73g
- I do a 10 minute daily workout on Fitbit Coach. It's a mixture between bodyweight exercises, some cardio, and a sprinkling of yoga.
- I run twice a week, not much, because I am ridiculously out of shape.

And finally a few stats:

BMR: 1663kcal

Body Fat: 28.8%

BMI: 28.8

Fat free body weight: 132lbs"
"NSV I didn’t eat the whole pizza (in one sitting anyway). TL;DR Thanks to OMAD I’ve taken control of my hunger/cravings and I can keep myself from eating a whole pizza in one sitting. 

I love pizza. Lemme say that again. I LOVE pizza. It’s my favorite freakin food. And, once COVID hit, I was stuck in my house with a bunch of time on my hands and some savings left over (workplace closed cause of COVID and I was out of a job). I ate quite a few deep-dish/pan crust/extra cheese pizzas from Domino’s all by myself, in my room, in between my many hours of sedentary video game playing. And maybe I’d also order a multi-serving side of alfredo pasta too. Oh and some of those breaded chicken bites they got. Oh and I never forget the ranch dip. I went wild. And it was great for the first few months. COVID hit right in the middle of my final semester at college, and boy was I burnt out. I needed a break and the stay at home orders felt like a godsend! Just eating tasty fast food (like pizza) and playing videogames, all day long. 

Until I clocked in at 260 lbs a month ago (I’m a 5’11” male). In 2018, when I was in the best shape and lowest weight of my life, I was at a muscular 170 lbs. That means, in 3 years, I have come to be 10 lbs short of being 100 lbs heavier than I was when I was in control of my weight and my health. 

Well, I’ve been doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) for maybe 2 weeks now? eating at noon everyday. (That’s following several failed attempts of getting myself back on track with my weight.) And it SUCKED at first. Mad cravings towards the night, lots of glasses of water to combat said cravings. A cheat day somewhere in between. But I’ve been doing it. And slowly the evening cravings have gotten less intense. AND, I’m not binging on food for the one meal I do get to eat. 

That’s where the pizza comes in. Finally ordered some Domino’s for the first time in forever. Guess what I got? Pan crust pepperoni and cheese pizza. Side of alfredo pasta. Ate all the pasta, it was only 600 cals. But the pizza.... man oh man what a good pizza. I can’t just let this all sit in the box. Just one more slice.......

NOPE. Ate 3 slices, closed the box, and put it in the fridge! That’s my meal for the day! And still under my TDEE calorie count. I’m honestly amazed and PROUD of myself for doing it. So many failures have lead to this, this simple decision that I consider to be a huge, crazy important victory for me. And best part of it all, I still got to eat the rest of the pizza. Ate the last few slices today, again within my calories. I just wanted to share this with y’all out of a combination of pride/excitement and also hoping that maybe in sharing my personal weight loss related trials and tribulations, someone who needs some inspiration can get it. 

I’ll share some more stuff in the comments so this doesn’t get any longer than it already is but if you’ve come this far thanks for reading. This subreddit has been such a great network of support and if it was one of your posts I read in the past I thank you for sharing as well. Feel free to ask me Q’s in the comments if you want. 

Man I could really go for some pizza right now."
"Finally committed in December and now I’m down almost 15 lbs!!! Hey guys! I just wanted to share my excitement because nobody around me cares in real life but it’s been a struggle so I just want to voice how proud I am of myself for sticking with it. But I started at 165 lbs after gaining THIRTY pounds my first year of my grad school program. I struggled to lose on and off because I was stress eating and drinking. 

I did a lot of fad diets at first that I couldn’t stick with because I’d never struggled with my weight like this and I was just too overwhelmed with life to think I could do it the “right way.” 

But I finally got the hang of both school and my diet/work out routine and am down to almost 150. That puts me 5 lbs away from my first goal and being back in a healthy weight BMI. 

I even was able to overcome my weight plateau this past week by incorporating weights into my work out and upping my calories a little bit. 

So proud I finally committed and stayed consistent in losing weight in a healthy manner. I wanted to thank a lot of you because while I didn’t post here, I did lurk here and become inspired by a lot of the posts to stick with it!"
"Childhood dream My parents were never into sports.  As a kid who loved sports and adventure...without any real positive sport related influence in my life it all just became a distant dream that was unreachable for me.  As i got older and fatter, I kinda just accepted that sports wasn’t something our family did.  

I (32m) was 350lbs at my biggest, but in the last four years I’ve managed to shed a 100 of those pounds.  And little by little, I tried and picked up hobbies/sports I never thought I’d ever be able to do.  In fact, I thought my best days were behind me, and with that I buried all my hopes of ever doing cool sporty things deep inside of me.

Well, I’m here to say to that adventure and sport loving kid....HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?!

This year I fulfilled one of my biggest childhood dream, I learnt to DOWNHILL SKI.  This shit is the best y’all.  Not only did I learn to do it, I’m getting pretty darn good at it.   I get emotional every time I hit the slopes, never did I think i’d get a shot at doing this type of thing.  It’s a second shot at life.

Anyways, if you find this losing weight thing difficult, cause it is....it’s really hard.  Think of that thing you’ve always dreamt of doing and never could.  And perhaps I’ll catch you out there on the slopes.  I’m the guy smiling ear to ear. ✌️

Edit: spelling"
"I finally told my therapist about my eating disorder. I've been a big time binge eater for the last 10 years or so; basically when I was a junior in high school onward. I've gained about 130 pounds since then, and I'm at about 308 right now. Eating is something that controls me and i haven't really ever addressed it before. 

I've been dealing with some chronic pain over the last month, which has brought up a lot of emotions, leading to more eating. After talking with my shrink (whom I hadn't talked with in about a year) about those feelings, she asked what I wanted to work on, and I realized that I am so sick of feeling like shit all the time. My wife and I want kids in the next year or two, and I can't raise a kid while having no stamina, feeling weak, feeling sluggish, feeling unconfident... They deserve better, and so do I.

I guess I wanted to share this with some strangers."
"I lost no weight for three months, but my waist lost 3 inches 27F 5'4-5"" SW 218 CW 167 GW 155 UGW???

Last November, I decided to take about a month and a half to maintain. I was burnt out on weight loss, and the 500 calorie deficit was starting to really get to me. In January, I went back to a calorie deficit, this time only 250, with the expectation that I would lose weight again, but that it would slooow.

And is has been slow. So freaking slow. 0.5 lbs per week is agonizingly slow, and sometimes a month will go by and the number won't change. It can be so discouraging.

But you know what has changed in this time? My measurements.

I took my measurements in December, when I was maintaining, because I have shrunk out of all of my clothing and, for the holidays, decided to treat myself to a nice, wool skirt. I had a 36"" waist.

I have a lot of injuries, and I mostly get exercise in two ways: walking and belly dancing. In these last few months of eating at a deficit, I started being more consistent, especially in my dancing. It's less about burning calories, though I am certainly happy with the extra food for the day-- dancing just feels good, and you can stop whenever anything starts to hurt in a bad way.

Last week, out of sheer frustration with the number on the scale and the desperate hope that all this work and deficit eating had gotten me somewhere, I decided to take my measurements, and GUYS.

&amp;#x200B;

**3 inches off my waist.**

**1 inch off each of my thighs.**

**.25 inches off my neck.**

**.25 inches off one of my arms, .5 off the other.**

**2 inches off my underbust. That means my bra is down a full band size.**

&amp;#x200B;

Guys. I didn't believe it. Seriously, I thought there was something wrong. Maybe I was really dehydrated? So I checked again the next day, and it was the same.

I checked again yesterday. .25 off the second arm, so they both lost .5 inches.

My scale has basically not moved in the last four months, but my measurements sure have. Weight is not the only metric.

All of this to say: PLEASE take your measurements. It seriously saved my mental game, and made me feel so encouraged about continuing the deficit."
"30 Day Accountability Challenge - Day 4 Hello losers,

I hope your day was full of joys small &amp; large.

Weigh in daily, enter in Libra &amp; report here even if I don’t like it: 232.6 this morning, 231.1 lbs trend weight. Heeeey guess who has a uterus in full-fledged violent coup? This lady. 

Stay within calorie range (1800): Doing okay here. More maintenance days than I like if I’m going to keep up the 3-4 pounds down a month but still better than a previous version of myself. 2/2 days. 

Exercise 5 days a week: 30-minute brisk walk at lunch &amp; 35 minutes vigorous stationary bike. 4/4 days.  

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, nonfood rewards): Have been doing some self-inventory about where I feel like I am in life &amp; what I want next. And I’ve decided whenever I get some sweet tax return money (don’t get me started on how the US handles taxes kids), I’m joining the quarantine starting trend &amp; getting a Switch. My buddies play Animal Crossing &amp; since I still can’t see much of them, I will take going to their islands &amp; dropping off ugly outfits. 

Try a new recipe once a week: Romanesco, roasted. New veggie, new recipe, I say it counts even though it tasted like a fun broccoli cauliflower love child. 1/4 weeks.   

Express mindfulness and or gratitude: Today I’m grateful for the internet &amp; easy access to books, blogs &amp; human’s encouraging other humans to never feel guilty for being human. Sounds weird &amp; niche but as someone who deals with diagnosed anxiety/depression &amp; CPTSD, sometimes knowing other humans feel like I do &amp; do it without feeling awful about just existing is so very cathartic. On that note, highly recommend Captain Awkward’s blog &amp; the book “Sorry I’m Late, I Didn’t Want to Come” by Jessica Pan.  

Your turn kids!"
"Therapeutic Closet Purge 🧺 👕 Hello losers ❤️

I am almost 40 lbs down now, which means my clothes are getting loose. 

I am not at goal weight yet so I can’t invest in a ton of new stuff but I do have to be, uh, clothed 😂 so I bought some new stuff.

But as I went to put said new stuff in my closet (it’s an Ikea thing so just a lot of drawers, no hangers) it hit me.

my closet was a disaster area.

Not because it was a gross mess (it was!) but because of the way it felt. Like a black hole of despair, source of sad feelings, vibe of profound sadness. The thing I opened every day and hated.

I stood there looking at these heaps of wrinkled, some even stained, stretched out “fat” clothes. All of it shoved into drawers. Hate clothes.

This closet clearly belonged to a person who was used to hiding so “why did it matter what she looked like.” These were the clothes of a person who hated getting dressed in the morning. 

(I know this is not always the case but it was for me. The weight gain had made me stop caring.)

Well, I went crazy 😝 

I dumped every single thing on the floor. After dusting the crap out of the shelves (which were gross and dirty) I tore through the piles. I filled an entire trash bag with clothes to throw out and another TWO bags with clothes to donate.

And then finally I folded &amp; placed my few new things into the pristine, empty wooden drawers. 

I stepped back, and felt the most profound weight lifting away.

So yeah, 10/10 recommend a closet purge ❤️"
"Monday marked my halfway mark. I started this journey at 77.2kg I'm not sure why I'm here. Maybe it's because right now I want to eat Chocolate and Fries. Ha.   
So I moved (Australian) states last September, and while I was active my eating was terrible and I was rather podgy. I knew I had some weight to lose, but I didn't realise I was classed as overweight. I'm 5ft5, and 13 weeks ago I was 77.2kg.   
I am married, but moved state 5 months ahead of my husband. I joined the gym in November and got a personal trainer. I figured I'd use the time to really focus on me. My word has it worked! I couldn't face going it alone, and needed direction. While it is kinda pricy, it's not forever. I said on the 12th week I wanted to be 68kg's and low and behold on the 12th week I weighed 67.9kg. My next target was to get to the 10kg mark. on my 13th week I flew past it. I weighed in at 66.2kg! I currently have another 9kg's I'd like to lose, and I'm staying strong.   
I know it's cliché to say but...... If i can do it, anyone can. Last November I felt awful about myself. I hated looking in the mirror and now it's not so painful. I feel my main issue is frustration. I just want to be at the end of it all. But! This is a marathon and not a sprint. I also want to buy new clothes, because my current wardrobe is starting to look a little loose on me.   
For me. I've truly learned that diets don't really work in the long term. It's all about making lifestyle changes and sticking with it. Sure you might have some bad weeks, but keep pushing forward. Sometimes you barely lose any weight. Which is fine. Especially as a woman with water retention and periods.   
Anyway that was my random post. I truly hope anyone looking at this page who is at the beginning of their journey, can look at this for some inspiration. I think the best thing I started doing was using small plates and bowls to really understand portion control."
"Weight loss isn’t always beautiful, personal take on food addiction Food addiction isn’t what you think it is in the traditional sense of addiction, or maybe it is, I don’t know. Here are a few examples of what it looks like: 

-wrappers upon wrappers surround your bedside tables of food you know you shouldn’t be eating, but simply could not stop yourself. I ate a FORTY TWO PACK box of fruit gushers in a little over a week. 

-if it’s at my disposal or within reach, I will eat it. I quite literally cannot keep poor food choices in my home, or I will binge eat it until it’s gone so that I don’t have to prolong the cycle of shame eating for any longer than it needs to be. (Read above) 

-I told old roommates and my partner, if they have a snack, to store it up high so that I cannot reach it and eat it. 

-it looks like staying up late until your partner falls asleep so that you can secretly eat snacks because you feel he might pass judgment (but he likely doesn’t even notice)

-it’s eating a tub of ice cream you and your partner were supposed to share, and since you ate the first half of it... instead of saving it, you waited until they slept so that you could sneak in your bedroom and finish it off, despite knowing how selfish it is. Despite knowing it would likely upset your partner. Having that sweet dopamine kick won over anything else, and it’s pathetic. 

I feel as though I have relapsed. As though I am completely out of control, as though I am weak and nothing more than a person who has absolutely no will power. It’s a cycle of knowing you can be better, but believing otherwise about yourself. It’s almost self abuse, I over eat to simultaneously feel happiness and also punish myself for lacking impulse control. 

Be kind to fat folk, we are not lazy, we are mentally ill. 

Weight loss journeys are not linear, and I am struggling today. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
"This is why you take progress pics even when you don't want to My stats: 26F, 5'6"", SW: 230-ish, CW: 165. GW: 145-ish.

I have such an aversion to taking pictures of myself, especially when I'm missing some articles of clothing. Like...looking at my body?? No thank you, I would rather lick sandpaper. I've been on my weight loss journey for about two years now, and I didn't take ANY progress pictures in the beginning. The one I'm linking here is, I think, the only such photo I have from 2019 (and that's after I lost maybe 20 pounds just by getting my thyroid under control. Not my heaviest at all!!)

So, late 2019 --&gt; now

[https://imgur.com/a/6SrtkRu](https://imgur.com/a/6SrtkRu)

It was a very spur of the moment, spontaneous sort of decision while visiting one of my best friends (so I felt relatively good at the time). But I do remember seriously thinking, ""what's the point of this? I'm going to look the same tomorrow, and next week too."" Spoiler alert: I DID. I did look the same the week after!! But one week snowballed into another, taking care of myself adds up, and now I DON'T look the same at all. How can I look at this and think that I do, that I've made no progress since then? Objectively, it's a flat-out lie.

I still don't like taking pictures. But I think it's important to recognize the value of them and the useful tool they can be. You are your own worst critic, but think of yourself as a work in progress...who you are now is NOT what you are going to be a year down the road. I have the proof."
"50 weeks fat loss, back gains NSFW I am marking this NSFW as in these shots there is a topless bloke, shots are of back..

I always had a big belly.. But I did not realise just how much fat I held on my back! This is 50 weeks of weight loss and about 5 months of weight lifting. I am really pleased with what I see here. I want to lose another 40 lbs, maybe 50 and then move onto building muscle as the priority. For now I need to get rid of more fat

I am 5.11"" tall, 37 years old and my start weight was 310 lbs - current is 229lbs. Started 50 weeks ago.

Id like to point out that the second pictured is ""posed"" and i am trying to spread my lats.

Any questions I will be happy to answer them, Thanks for reading!

"I need to vent to someone Is there such thing as an eating disorder in a sense of you over eating? I have such an unhealthy relationship with food and my weight has been climbing rapidly for over a year now with quarantine and all the extra added stress...

I feel absolutely disgusted by myself and I just want to cry... today I weighed myself at 271lbs... this is the heaviest I’ve ever been

I feel like I’m stuck. Gyms aren’t really in my budget, I don’t have space at home, and my anxiety prevents me from going outdoors to work out in fear of being attacked in the streets (the worlds a scary place and I hate leaving on foot alone, I drive everywhere now due to the anxiety and panic being outside alone gives me) or fear of people seeing me work out so unfit... 

I need someone to talk to and some advice I’m struggling badly and I can’t keep doing this..."
"I’m not obese anymore I know BMI is kind of stupid as a measurement tool because it doesn’t tell the full story but I’ve been obese for quite a few years now. 

I was always a healthy weight growing up but due to some horrible circumstances and trauma during college I ended up turning to food as a coping mechanism and gained about 70 lbs in a year.

I am happy to say though that  as of weighing myself today, I’m no longer in that “obese” category and now just “overweight”. It might seem small but seeing that made me want to cry because it’s the first time in at least 5 years that I haven’t been obese. 

I started at 194 on January 5th. Down 22 lbs as of today. 21 more to reach my first goal of 151.

I’ve done this by cutting calories down to 1200-1400 a day, following a plant based diet, and doing a lot of walking."
"I’ve officially been in a calorie deficit for 30 days. First time I feel like I’m making smart sustainable lifestyle changes 26F here about 2 months into my journey but 30 days on serious mode. I gained a lot of weight in college/grad school... went from about 170 lbs to 270 by the time I got my graduate degree. Back in 2018 I decided to put in work through the gym and stop eating out so much and I lost 40 lbs over a few months but stalled around 230 lbs. Recently I’ve had a lot of stressful events and around the holidays went up to 242 lbs. I just said enough is enough, I need to get serious about this and make some changes. I can’t live like this, unhealthy and hating myself. 

All throughout January I made efforts to move more and eat less but I didn’t track calories. I lost about 3 lbs but had some weak moments and gained the 3 lbs back before the end of the month. February rolled around and I downloaded my fitness pal and started getting serious. I’ve logged every bite of food or drink since then, aiming for around 1700 cals a day, and I’m down 9.2 lbs. I know this rate of loss won’t continue but I’m going to keep going with this deficit. I also have tried to add 30 minute walks or exercise to my day 5 times a week and that helps. 

For the first time I feel like I’m making REAL sustainable changes. I eat what I want, including pizza, starbucks, McDonald’s, dessert, etc. I just make sure it fits into my deficit. I don’t feel like I’m restricting myself and I just generally feel great and healthy. 

I was so scared of counting calories and becoming obsessed with numbers and food, but honestly since I started tracking I think about weight loss way LESS. I don’t have to worry because I know I will continue to lose weight as long as I continue to be in a deficit. 

We can ALL do this. My goal is to lose 50 lbs total before my wedding in November. Can’t wait for the next 30 days of tracking and progress."
"Thank you all so much Hey everybody! I’m so happy to announce that I finally reached 200lbs from my starting point of 260 back in August. 

Some info on my journey. I’m 17M, and in August I weighed &gt;260lbs, and decided I needed to start working on myself after my brother got diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and was on insulin at 21 years old. This terrified me and pushed me into changing my life so I could hopefully avoid it. I started off with just walking a lot, 5 miles a day outside. In September I found this sub, learned about CICO, and started calorie counting. I’m eating ~1700-1800 calories a day. Things went extremely well, my parents are super supportive of me, and my dad is using the LoseIt app as well, and helps make and shares the food when he makes dinner. Anytime throughout these past few months I felt close to giving up, I started going through this sub. Seeing everyone’s accomplishments, struggles, questions, answers really motivated me and kept my mind focused on completing my goals. And finally today, I reached exactly 200lbs! My ultimate goal is 185 and then to start working out and gain muscle.

Some NSV I’ve noticed: My Jean waist size went from a 42 to a 34 inch, my shirt size went from XXL to L, my skin is clearer, my confidence is finally not terrible and I feel comfortable going outside in t-shirts, I can walk a lot more than I used to be able to, snowboarding is a heck a lot more fun now and I don’t get tired right away, and I sleep WAY better. I even had to retake my senior pictures because I looked so much different than I did in August!
(I hope this is how you share pictures here!) 

https://imgur.com/gallery/pbHdqrx

This sub and the community here is amazing. Any question I had was answered, questions I didn’t even know I had were answered, so much support here is truly amazing and I’m sure this is one of the best places to be to stay motivated to lose weight. I honestly think this subreddit might have saved my life, if not only prolonged it by several years. 

Please everyone, stay motivated, stay encouraged, stay focused, remember your goals and why you’re doing this! Y’all can do this!"

I've been trying to lose weight for 4 months now and i'm so close to my GW and it feels amazing. I still wanna go below 70kg but 70kg was my goal when i first started. I started out with walking a lot and counting the calories in my food.

As i progressed i started to become even more motivated so i also started doing to do some workouts. I feel like i have made changes to my lifestyle that are sustainable so i'm so excited for the future!! 

I felt so bad about my body for such a long time, feeling completely hopeless. Now i can't even describe how happy i am about it and i see so much positives impacts on other parts of my life too which is amazing.

This is such a great community and i just want to say that i believe in every single one of you!!

"Phentermine and anxiety help Hello, 

So I’ve started taking phentermine again to try and lose some of my extra weight. My doctor prescribes it through a weight loss clinic. I’ve noticed something about it...by the end of the day I have these panic attacks that last for about an hour...not sure why this is happening. I gave up caffeine entirely. I thought maybe my dose was too high (I’m prescribed 37.5 twice a day—-please just don’t bash me for that, it is a thing that doctors prescribe this much so it’s totally legit). I split the pills in half too. I get up at 4 am so my days are long. So I take 1/2 pill 4 times a day. I actually have taken the same amount a few years back and had no problems with any anxiety. Now this time around I do....

Anyone else have this problem?"
"I can’t lose weight anymore, please help Hi, Since 2021 I’ve been trying to lose weight and despite having a really strong start, it is now completely stagnated. 

My weight is already healthy, sitting at a BMI value of 24, but I want to lose weight nonetheless because I’m not satisfied with my body. I decided to start my weight loss process after Christmas/NYE and my birthday (january 1). I weighed myself January 2 and the result was 87,5kg. After 2 weeks I reduced it to 84,5kg. I was stoked and motivated to lose even more (didn’t have a specific goal). At the end of January my weight was 84kg. I already thought that was pretty weird because I was doing the exact same as I did the first 2 weeks, but didn’t really paid attention to it and just assumed that it was a bad timing. 

However, it’s now March 5 and my weight is still exactly 84kg. This really demotivates me and I’m even feeling like quitting. I’m going running 2/3 times per week for an hour each, I stay below 1500 calories everyday, with the only exceptions being sometimes on Saturday/Friday but even on those days it’s still below 2500, which is the preferred amount for adult men. 

How is this possible? What am I doing wrong? Anyone with the same experience?"
Lost 40 then gained 10! Help! I started my weight loss journey at 186 pounds and in 2 years got down to 145. All of this was done with calorie tracking. I had maintained 145 for about a year until I got my office job where I sit around all day and eat extra meals from stress and just not really having extra time for passions besides wanting to eat and go out for drinks with coworkers. I let go of my good habits and it’s become really hard for me to get back on track. I’ve gained 10 pounds over 6 months at this job and those 10 pounds have made the biggest decline in my confidence. Im pretty bummed but I know I can fix these habits. I thought maybe some fresh perspective or advice could help me so here’s a few questions: What would you try to make your eating schedule look like if you weren’t home for 10-10.5 hours of the day? Also does anyone have any tips on getting in more movement during your day with a desk job? Any other advice and tips you could offer on motivation or just weight loss in general would be very helpful😊 thank you for listening!
"The trick to NOT counting calories Ok so I've been doing this whole ""losing weight"" stuff for about 6 months now and have lost a decent 60 lbs and from what I've been seeing everywhere it seems I'm doing one thing wrong and it's not counting calories, I don't got a weight for my food, I don't measure stuff in a cup 24/7, I don't weight my poop, etc.

But then I realized I did something that not many do and it's the ""20 calories up rule"" which I made up but comes from some truth, many foods will often tell you how many calories are in the package by amounts, whether it's cups, servings, it will tell you it but the truth is they're allowed to be wrong, and generally speaking they usually are wrong by 20 calories so here's what I'll do:

I'll go into the kitchen, serve myself a bowl of cereal, looks like a cup and a half of 180 calories, make it 200, milk cup serving is 160, it looks like 180, there I went from a 340 calorie meal to a 380 calories, so this throughout the day and depending on how far you go (I always assume anything 170 or higher is 200) you ""added"" an extr 100-400 calories to your deficit, and when I say ""added"" I mean corrected, generally speaking when people measure and weight stuff they get better results cause the results show true colors, if you're ironically too lazy to do that like me then you end up with this weird method where you just round out that 460 calories burger to 500 and ""burn"" an extra 40 calories"

"Gf is struggling with no drop in weight. Hi everyone,

My Gf just started a proper weight training program and caloric deficit which has weekly check ins through the app. Before this she was on a low carb diet for about 4 months which was very restricted.
Anyway after these last few check ins on the new diet her weight isn’t going anywhere and she gets so disheartened and I’m not sure how to help other them telling her to just be patient and keep going. I’m on the same diet and have lost 6kg in 8 weeks, her prior diet we looked at what her calories roughly were and it was under 1000. So I’ve read that her body could be adjusting to her new calories which are 2,400cal because she under ate for so long?

Any advice would be welcome, just trying to reassure her that her diet will work."
"I’m scared of gaining when I start maintenance, any tips? I’m currently just doing CICO and doing really good exercises and I can definitely see good progress since I’ve started in the first week of January. 

My current total calorie intake for weight loss is a bit low(nothing to be alarmed about as it’s safe and not restrictive), and my estimated total daily intake to maintain my goal weight will be around 2,000-2,100 calories if I continue exercising(which I plan to do since I love being active). 
I’m lucky that I won’t have to lose too much weight to get my goal as I’ll have to lose around 40lbs or 18kg.

I figure once I reach the goal the most logical thing to do is to slowly increase my calorie intake until I get to the maintenance intake so that my body doesn’t freak out. But I’ll admit, I don’t know what to do in order to successfully move my calorie intake up to maintain since I have a large fear of regaining since I yo-yo dieting for multiple years and typically gained back due to my previous binge and restrict cycles.

To those who have lost weight and kept it off for awhile how have you been able to increase your calorie intake to maintain and not regain?"
"Why do I get RAVENOUS every time I lose 10 pounds? Why do I get RAVENOUS every time I lose 10 pounds?

This baffles me. I’ve lost 48 pounds from my highest weight. 28 of that has been since the end of October.

I’ve lost a steady pound and a half a week on average.

Every time I hit another 10 pounds down I get INSANELY hungry. It’s like an insatiable hunger that doesn’t go away.

It happened when I went from 238 to 228 and now that I’ve hit 218 it’s happening again. 

I don’t gain anything from it because I’m not going over my maintenance calories.

I don’t mind it but it seriously stalls my progress by two or three weeks when it happens. 

It’s just odd. I’ve never had a “hunger” problem. I had a tracking problem"
"My biggest problem: I don’t know what to eat every day. Please help. I am so confused at this point. 

I know that I want to take in the maximum nutrients my body needs, but with the minimum of energy (calories) it needs. Because fat is just energy, and we take in too few nutrients but too much energy which then is saved by the body as fat. 

My biggest problem is, I don’t know what eat every day. I’m tired of preparing, cooking, storing it in my refrigerator, looking for reduced prices on foods when maybe there had been a better simpler alternative anyway. Eating is a life-long liability, and I just want to know how I can manage it easily and give my body what it needs for the rest of my life. 

So what foods can I eat that are 1. healthy, 2. cheap, and 3. easily and quickly prepared? It doesn’t even need to taste well or be cooked. If it means putting everything in a blender and drinking as a smoothie, that’s fine with me too (again, as long as it’s healthy, cheap and easily made)."
"(M16 5 feet 8 inches tall)(SW 152 GW 120 CW 150) My mom and stepdad are saying that I'm being too hard on myself. Sorry my writing ability can be foggy at times.

So I am 16, and I am healthy in general. I'm good at basketball and want to try my hand at gridiron football. I go on jogs and even used to lift weights in PE (I can't afford a gym membership) and I used to squat 105 and bench 75. I even have a six pack under all my fat. 

When I was a child I was skin and bones, literally no fat at all. My dad fed me all the junk food you could imagine for me to gain weight. He even took me to doctors but it turns out my metabolism was in full gear. He left when I was 11 (I weighed like 90 pounds then) and I just kept eating like I normally would (I still do). When I was 13 (2017) I stated noticing a bit of flab and by 2018 I was fat. People started making fun of me for my moobs but I've shrunk them down. I tried my first diet (keto) in march 2019 and that was too hard. I tried again in septemeber 2019,  february 2020, and june/july 2020 and failed. Then in july 2020 I, weighing 150 pounds went on a 1500 calorie diet and lost 20 pound in four months. I had a healthy workout schedule, I meditated, slept well and everything. I then relapsed and gained it all back in 4 months.

Last night I told my mom and stepdad about a 1000 calorie diet I was on to burn fat quickly. Mom said ""you should do some research about diets for pubescent teens."" and my stepdad said ""You will be hungry all the time and will be unable to sustain yourself"" My stepdad also said how I'm young and should just worry about excercise. are they right, what should I do?"
"[Century Club] March 4, 2021 - Have you lost or need to lose 100 lbs or more? Here’s a thread just for you! I have often welcomed those who have lost 100+ lbs (\~ 50 kg , \~7 stone) to “the club” and joked that club meetings were on Thursdays. I recently suggested that we try out having a regular weekly thread to talk about issues that are particular to those who have lost 100+ lbs, those who are well on their way and those who are just at the beginning of a journey this big.

Welcome back to the Century Club! Each week I will provide a topic of the day that has been on my mind or inspired by previous posts. However you are free to talk about any topics you think might be relevant to current and prospective club members.

Today's topic: **Is it worth it?**

A few days ago I saw a post asking if the weight loss was worth it. ""Do people treat you better? Do you feel better? Do you find it easier to meet people?"" So that started me thinking about what exactly made my journey ""worth it"" for me. 

Of course it was worth it from a health perspective. I will be going in for my annual physical in a couple of weeks and we'll see what my doctor thinks. I got off CPAP, maybe I can get off my blood pressure meds this year.

I'm also way more fit than I have ever been in my adult life thanks to being more regularly active. Even though I have not been running much this month, I have been walking 7500-10000 steps most days and keeping up with the NHS Strength and Flex routine that has been providing a reasonable alternative to running that should actually help me when I start running again.

At the core though it boils down to a single simple thing for me now. Self confidence. I know that I am capable of doing something most people find quite elusive: Losing a very significant amount of weight and keeping it off for longer than a year. I am in control of my weight. If I overeat, it's no one else's fault. All mine. If my eating habits lead to weight gain over time, it's my fault for not adjusting my intake to whatever my current activity levels may be.

I know well the simple knob I need to adjust so that I can stay at my current weight level. Eating just a little bit less if I want my weight to trend downwards. For the past 90 days or so I've been on a slight upwards trend. Happy Scale shows my trend weight going up at about 2 lbs/90 days so 8 lbs a year, ~100 kcal/day over maintenance at ~155. As the weather improves, and I can resume running regularly, I expect that trend will reverse. But I also know that don't need to really change much until I look at the March/April/May trend. Even if I gain another 2 lbs by June, my trend weight will be at the middle of my 10 lb maintenance range.

Anyhow, that self confidence is what drives a lot of the other non-medical benefits of keeping the weight off. Even though we're not in a current pandemic situation that allows for much in the way of social interaction, presenting myself with more confidence makes it easier to strike up random conversations and makes it easier for others to treat you well and meeting new friends or potential romantic partners.

So what about you Centurion? What makes losing 100+ lbs worth it for you? Is there some benefit of losing the weight that you didn't expect?"
"16 year old male skinny but fat belly looking for advice Sex: Male
Age: 16 years old
Height: 5’9
Weight: 121 lbs / 55 kg

Hey guys I recently started gym as I’m 16 and wanted to get in shape.
My stomach and chest stick out weirdly and the most annoying bit is the crease i above my belly button. 

I want a flat stomach so I can work on abs and chest but I don’t know what to do is it my posture or bloating or abs weakness or a mix of them.
I’m not sure how to attack my stomach and chest and what I can do any advice I want to fix it.

I’m thinking to start an training as it’s probably just a weak core and chest I really don’t like crunches they give me migraines And make me feel sick swinging back and forth.

Here’s some pics to help:

"Starting my journey I really don't know where to begin but I am starting my weight loss journey of 300+ (too ashamed to step on the scale to fully know.) Pounds. It started with a friend of mine who died three days after Christmas. He was house bound because of his weight, he was starting to lose weight, but his heart gave out because it was too late. I now realize that if I don't lose weight, I could find myself in the same position. I have started my gym membership, and weightwatchers for what it is worth. I also am scheduling with a doctor to get my sleep apnea diagnosed. I am done telling myself that it doesn't matter , that suicide by apathy is not okay. I hope to keep yall updated with good news in the weeks to come."
"Bloating when working back towards maintenance I (19F, 5’5”, 123lbs) recently stopped cutting calories after doing so for about 5 months. I stopped a week ago from Monday. I increased my calories from about 1500 to 1700-1800. I still workout, doing resistance training 3x a week for an hour each time and cardio 2x a week for 45 mins each time. I’ve noticed that I’ve been EXTREMELY bloated while doing this. Like I looked at the scale, and I’m seeing 1lb fluctuations overnight. Is this normal and will this go away?? Is it just because my body is getting used to more food? I’m scared that I’m gonna wind up starting to gain weight. Like I just feel so full and heavy so often and I absolutely hate it. I’m still eating healthy and whatnot. Is it just because I was cutting for so long and my body is confused?? I’m just getting a bit worried.

Edit: Oops I actually just turned 19 and wrote 18 not that it makes a huge difference but figured I should fix it 😂😂"
"Here I go again... but this time, I'm looking for some friends. I am F/31/5'4"". I currently weigh 177 pounds. In Feb 2019, I was over 200 pounds, and I started my weight loss journey. It wasnt the first time I tried to lose weight, but it was the first time I was successful. I did CICO and a lot of walking and cardio, and within 9 months i had lost 60 pounds. I was so proud, and confident, and convinced I'd never return to my ways. I never did quite reach my goal (127) but I was down to 143 at my lowest.

Then came the pandemic, and the lockdowns, and my whole life went topsy-turvy. I couldnt get out, my kid was home all the time, my husband was home all the time. It was cheaper to just cave into their meals than eat all my carefully planned ones. I quit exercising. I started binging. I stopped weighing myself, measuring myself, taking photos.

Here I am, almost completely back to square one. I was 180 pounds on Sunday when I finally mustered the courage and strength to take control of my life again. I know I can do this, because I've done it before, but that doesn't take the sting out of it. I've gained 12 inches around my hips, 13 inches around my thighs... like what? Wtf did I do? How did I let it spiral this long? I'd be lying if I said I havent been an emotional wreck all week long. I'm trying to not beat myself up about it... but I'd be lying if I said I haven't done that, too.

I'm determined, though. I can and will fix this. This was just another step in my journey. An experience to learn from, and make adjustments so I dont crumple under such sudden life changes. But last time... I was really lonely. I dont have any friends where I live, and I could really use a friend on a similar journey to share experiences with. Someone to cheer on, and care enough to cheer me on, too. I'm hoping to find that here. Preferably someone close to my stats, but I wont be picky about that, either. I will say I'd rather the person be female, though. I've had a lot of creepy guys in my PMs last time when I would post my progress, so I'm leery of guys reaching out, sorry!

Here is my [unprogress pic](https://imgur.com/a/SPQJ7wz). Its so upsetting so see how this shirt used to hang off me, and now I'm back to this... I'll be back to that first picture hopefully around the same time frame. Here I go again!"
"What do you think of my Transformation Plan Going to use this to keep me accountable and post about my progress. I have bet £900 that I will lose 40lb by the 3rd October - when I win I will get £2k back.

Weight Loss Plan:
Goal: By the 30 September 2021 I will weigh 147lb and will be lean and strong.

Starting Position: I will take before photos and then weekly photos after that. I will weigh every week and I will measure my waist. I will take weekly progress photos.

Nutrition: I will eat 1,400 calories a day with a rough 30% protein, 35% fat and 35% carbs. I will plan my food each week and it will include 3x meals and an evening snack. I will think about nutrition &amp; protein intake &amp; water intake.

Workouts: before the gym re-open I will aim to walk 7,500 to 10,000 steps a day and do a home workout 3x per week based around body weight movements

After the gym re-open I will do 3x 5x5 workouts of some description and aim to get stronger on deadlifts, bench press, overhead press and squat. I will also aim to get stronger on these lifts.

I will post starting photos and measurements at some point over the next few days and I will weigh monday morning.

"Help... Hi. I'm a 17 y/o female and I need advice. I'm 5"" 6 ( and a half...). I started trying to losing weight in January. Not sure how much I weighed at the start of January, but in December I weighed 234. Currently I weigh 220. I've just been eating less and working out more, but I'm worried I will not be able to reach my goal. I start college in 6 months/ 25 weeks and I want to lose as much weight as I possibly can (in a healthy way) I hope to lose 50 pounds... at least. Also I ordered my graduation gown in a size smaller so I need to lose like 20 pounds by the end of may to meet that criteria. It fits (gowns are pretty loose), but I thought using my grad gown as like goal clothing would help me. Any advice?"
"Has anyone lost weight without counting calories? 32F|5'2""|SW:160|CW:160|GW:140 I started gaining weight around when I turned 30, then COVID happened and my weight is at an all time high. I'm also finding that most of my weight gain is around my waist &amp; back. For a few months now, i keep losing and gaining about 3 lbs. So frustrating.

I've always enjoyed working out (3x full body strength workouts, 3x run/walk per week). What’s really challenging for me is keeping track of calories. Also bc I eat a lot of Asian food, I find it harder to record on apps like MyFitnessPal. I read a lot of success posts and seems like most people here lose weight by eating around a certain # of calories. 

Are there any other recommended methods to lose weight &amp; maintain? Has anyone successfully lost weight by intermitten fasting, cutting out snacks/desserts, portion control?

Any help would be appreciated."
"Should I be concerned about my weight loss this week? Hey everyone!

So I've been in a calorie deficit since January 1.. I've consistently lost about 1-1.5 pounds a week, I'm 5'2.5 and my start weight was 180. I've been eating around 1400-1500 calories with no intense exercise, just walking my dog for about an hour-ish daily!

Currently, I am sitting at 165. Now, this week has been weird... I've been dealing with some stomach issues, it's coming to that time of the month, BUT, I am down almost 5 pounds this week. I've been a little more snacky this week to supplement and upped the water, but still losing about 1/2- a pound each day.

Is this something I should be concerned about? Is this normal? I don't like things out of whack and I'm getting nervous.

Thank you!"
"How much should I be eating? (F, 21, 5’2) Hello everyone, I’ve been lurking for some time and I apologize if this is not the place I should be posting this! 

I last weighed myself at 137.6, which means I have put on 20+ pounds over quarantine. I have made the executive decision to get in control of my weight and health, and have been dieting for the last 2 weeks successfully! 

Now my question— I have seen a ton of mixed information on how many calories I should actually been eating. I would like to get down to 115/110. My TDEE is 1,608 and my BMR is 1,341. 
I am relatively sedentary but I have been trying to walk a lot more during the week. I would LOVE to lose 10 pounds by May 10th, but I’m not sure if that is too rapid. I am willing to cut down calories for a little while to see some serious results, but overall I am trying to sustain as well. 

Sorry for talking so much!! I appreciate all the help!!"
"Personal experience: HIIT cardio and eating too low of calories were killing my progress and making me plateau in the long term I am 26 F. My starting weight was 215LBs and I am currently at 144.4 (my goal is 130). Fairly muscular but with some body fat clinging on.

For awhile once I hit 147 a few months ago, I decided to overload on my workout, start HIIT cardio and reduce my deficit even more (eating at 1,200-1,300 depending on the intensity of my workout sessions. 

I usually did HIITafter strength training and lifting compound weights.

This process gave me quick progress for a few days to a month and I even lost 5 pounds, but I realized that in the long term, I started to just get flabby and my weight loss stalled completely. I was getting weaker and couldn’t progress with weights, lost my period and was developing bad insomnia. It made me feel absolutely miserable.

HIIT training was taking a toll on my body and I was sore everyday and eventually it lead to a total burn out in which I couldn’t even go to the gym or think about it for a month.

These days I do low or medium state cardio and I’ve increased my calories to 200 more (between 1400-1600) and I can adhere to it longer. I even lost two pounds within a two week period and feeling stronger.

Wonder if you’ve had any similar experiences"
"(F/28/4'10"")(165&gt;147=18lbs lost in 2 months) The Best Birthday Present I'm finally down to ""overweight"" today...my birthday!

I've been ""obese"" for about the last 6 years (baby weight I gained and never lost). But when the spring semester started this year, I started counting calories, eating around my goal maintenance, 1200 cals a day. I haven't been recording EVERYTHING I eat, I let myself have my 15 cal creamer without recording it and if I know my dessert will fit in my day (after I've recorded everything else), I dont bother entering that, either. I believe this is helping me to make this a lifestyle change rather than a diet. I tried using MFP before and being very diligent and it was just too much, being a little more easygoing is really helping me!

I also started using BeachBody about 3 weeks ago. Our local gym is closed still (covid) and I really need someone, whether on a screen or in person, to tell me what to do and when and for how long when I'm exercising. I'm enjoying lifting some weights for the first time in my life and can definitely feel my arms and core becoming more defined.

Anyways, as of today, my real life birthday, I am no longer ""obese""! Im so proud of myself and couldn't ask for a better birthday present!"
"Where do you lose/gain first? For me I gain first in my tummy, then boobs, face and then very last bum/thighs. Proper apple shape.

I lose first in reverse order of the above, so because I have long limbs I'm always walking around looking like Mike Wazoski with a wide middle. I know I will have to do body recomposition when I'm down to an acceptable weight but the journey is long, and for many reasons I'm only losing weight through calorie restriction at the moment. I'm pretty tall (5'11F, CW:225 GW:?) so I don't really notice a 10, even 20lb weight change immediately. All of a sudden my bras don't fit anymore and look at that, yup I'm up 30lbs. Bloody hate it. The minute my bum starts looking plump, I know straightaway I'm back up in the high numbers. Anyway, rant over. Feel free to ignore or comment, just needed to get that off my chest, along with these fricking shoulder boulders."
"I’m 17, 6’1, 275 Lbs. I’m trying to lose weight, my goal is 225 by the end of the year. I need help finding a diet. As the title says I’m trying to lose weight. I’m trying to figure out how many carbs and calories I should do. I would say I’m pretty active, I work full time, and walk 7+ miles a day. I’m starting to get into mountain biking and plan on going once a week as soon as the trails are open. I have pretty good self control, I did keto for about a month and lost 40 pounds, but I do not want to do it again, I felt terrible the entire time and had no energy so it’s a no go. I’m thinking of doing a low carb low calorie diet but I have no idea the amount I should do. I still want to be able to have some dessert or a soda every once in a while. Any advice is appreciated."
"Fitbit calories vs tde Does anyone know if Fitbit is accurate? I did a calculation of what I should be eating online and it said with losing weight around 1400 calories but then Fitbit can have me eating 1800 while still being at a 750 calorie deficit which is what it has me at to lose weight. I know I always do 12k steps plus because I walk to and from work and some days I go to the gym so is it adding calories for this? And would I be better off still eating less and just take that as a bigger deficit on the days I go to the gym etc? 

Sorry just after opinions on measuring through Fitbit or whether MyFitnessPal is better as I can go back to using that so it doesn’t f with my numbers"
"caloric deficit is still too much Hello, I have a weird problem, because right now I eat 2200kcal, and my TDEE is 2600kcal (acording to some sites even more as i am 16 year old, 84kg, 188cm excersising two times a week) so in theory i'm in 400 calorie deficit. But i can't eat that much! I get full and then i have to eat by force and that dosen't seem like something i should have to do on a diet. My first thought was that my meal plan is just wrong, but i checked it twice in different calculators and it is still looks like it's 2200kcal. So I checked whether my TDEE is wrong, but no matter what calculator i use it always shows something between 2500 to 3000kcal. So i thought maybe i have some hidden added calories (like oil when frying etc.) but no, I have everything planned out. So i thought maybe I overcompensate my excersises, but it tourned out that even i wasnt excersising at all I still should be in a caloric deficit. What should I do? I worry that if I cut more it will be too drastic of a defecit, but if I don't cut i worry I will gain weight."
"Advice for someone who is looking to lean out? Hi!

I’m female, 21, 5’4.5” and 120-125 lbs. Always been fairly slender looking and people are usually surprised that my weight is what it is.

I also run about 80-100km/ month and try to either hit the gym, if it’s open, about 3-5 times a week on top of my run OR lately since it’s closed - do a home workout using bodyweight - about 30 minutes or so. I’ve got a fairly defined core but I still look a little “fluffy” for my taste.

My diet is pretty clean, I never eat out (and if I do it’s once a month or so, because my boyfriend and I love sushi). I like fruits and veg and have some everyday. Love coffee. Have a finicky bowel though :’)

My calorie intake roughly varies from 1300 - 2200 per day (I’ve had trouble with food and restriction in the past so I’m trying to get a grip on normal eating). I’m trying to track what I eat now and not go over 1800 (I’ve had trouble keeping it at 1500 or less though, other than on days I under-eat from anxiety).

I’m a full time student in a pretty strenuous program, so a lot of my day is spent sitting - but once I’m done a year or so more, my program/career will require lots of walking and standing in the OR/hospital. This is partially why I love running because it shakes out some of my stress. I try to go on a walk, a run, and a little workout when I have time so my body doesn’t have extremely long periods of idleness. 

How many calories and how much exercise do I need if I’d like to just lean out a little? I can’t seem to shed the extra bit of fluff off my now pretty muscular legs. I’d want to lose maybe 10 lbs in a sustainable way, just to gain some more definition. I know I can MyFitnessPal it - but when I cut my calories I feel tired and foggy and can’t focus on school because of hunger. This is why intermittent fasting couldn’t be an option for me. 

Thank you so much, sorry if this is too vague.

Cheers guys (:"
"hi all, authentic fat guy here with a question about if what I'm doing is healthy. so im fat, and i dont wanna be so fat anymore so I've made some changes recently. I began writing down and keeping track of my weight about a month ago and stepped on the scale each morning, or so when I remembered to lol (I started 1/29  @ 370lbs). 
I've also began counting my calories and have upped the amount of water i intake a day by about double from what I used to. I've been eating one meal a day and have limited myself to around ~1000 - ~1500 calories daily, with the occasional day here and there of around ~2000 calories or maybe even a small bit more (it's hard to resist a pastry or sweet food for me sometimes and I give in some days, but hey I'm human)

I work an app based job which has me on my feet walking around grocery stores all day. I dont eat or drink anything besides water from the moment I wake up to when I finish working in the evening and then have dinner. I dont even feel hungry for lunch or breakfast. I've also completely cut out snacking throughout the day. No more chips or candy unless I'm specifically having some as a dessert.

I weighed myself today (3/4) and I'm at 352lbs. So in 35 days I've lost 18lbs total, which I'm absolutely happy about and proud of myself for, but is that okay from a medical perspective? I dont feel sickly or weak, I'm not starving myself because honestly I dont feel hungry throughout the day and I just fill myself up on water. I feel better than what I felt like 2 months ago that's for sure.

Can anybody shoot some thoughts/opinions/advice? 

TLDR;
In about a month I've lost 18lbs, is this okay?"
"How Much Should I Actually Be Eating In A Day To Lose 1LB/week? I've been following multiple fitness plans for the past few years. Everything had been working well... until now... I have hit a very slow fat loss plateau.

I currently weight 150lbs; I am 5' 10""; My BMR is approximately 1700; I am male. 

I should mention that I currently am at a calorie deficit of 1800 calories/day except on my ""cheat meal"" days where I bump that up to 2250 calories. I track everything with MFP.

I workout 4 to 5 times per week. It currently mainly consists of 60 minutes of interval walking/running on the treadmill. My walking speed is 4MPH, and my running speed varies between 7-8MPH. I do also do about 15 minutes of bodyweight training (with the Fitify app) using a weighted backpack for many of the exercises.

According to omnicalculator, I burn approximately 700-800 calories (not sure how accurate that is) while on the treadmill. And according to my Fitify app, I burn about 100-150 calories (also not sure how accurate that is) doing the bodyweight exercises. 

I am also a part-time retail worker. I work approximately 28 hours per week.

I have went onto MANY different calorie calculator sites, but they do not allow me to input these types of figures, so it just gives me the ""typical"" estimate of my ""maintenance calories being 2500"" blah blah. But I want to know what is the best way to figure out what my ACTUAL maintenance calories should be and how many calories I should ACTUAL cut to to truly connect myself back to that fat loss track that I was sitting on.

It honestly sucks knowing that I am SO close to my weight loss goals and now it just stopped, a pudge-pool sitting around my bellybutton area that does not want to disappear. 

Thank you all so much, in advance!"
"Can someone recommend easy and painless workouts? Here's what I was thinking. Often when I'm mopping the kitchen or something like that, it doesn't feel like a workout, I get a little bit warm and energized and get the chore done. But the next day I feel slightly sore in a good way. I can feel certain muscles. 

So I was thinking it would be great to find a workout that basically feels fun and easy and you get a bit warm and energized. The key being that it's not actually painful or tough to accomplish. But then you feel it the next day and it's obvious you were using your muscles after all. 

Is there a youtube workout or series something like this? I hate how so many workouts are all about working through the pain or complex yoga positions and stuff. I just want something I can do regularly and not dread but enjoy - maybe for 20-30 mins a day at home, no equipment. Even better if it lets you upgrade the routine once it's really too easy."
"I want to break up with my scale, but I keep crawling back. I'm 5'10 35/f @206lbs. I've been on my weight loss journey since last December and I've lost 30lbs, which I'm really proud of. But now I've been stuck at 206 for weeks and it's killing me. 

I know the scale doesn't tell the full story. I know I'm losing fat because I'm working out hard and eating at a deficit. I know you hold on to water weight if your muscles are sore. I know all this but I keep stepping on that scale! 

Getting under that 200 mark is a huge deal for me. I think I'd happily chuck my scale in the trash once I'm there, but until then those six pounds are my albatross around my neck. It's such a psychological battle. 

Has anyone successfully broken up with their scale and had a few tips? Or even been there? I dunno, I'm just struggling."
"Scared of developing eating disorder from a calorie deficit because of a friend I'm using a throwaway as  I really really do not wish for this to be traced to my real account, apologies in advance. I'm so sorry if this sounds stupid

And the title really. Ever since I've been on a calorie deficit (1200cals, -300 from TDEE). I have been told by my friend that my behavior towards this diet is 'worrying' and that me counting calories is 'abnormal' and now she's scared me into thinking I'm going to develop an eating disorder. But that is no way true, my BMI has rocketed since lockdown and whilst I'm at a healthy weight, I am at the end of that spectrum and if I gain a little more, I'll be classed as overweight. I no longer fit nicely into any of my clothes and have become very unfit and unhealthy. She says I'm already skinny and refuses to listen to me when I tell her about my BMI and how losing weight will regain my self-confidence and clothes. She tells me she's worried and this displays an unhealthy relationship with food, following it on my telling me love handles are a myth (the one thing I really want to decrease). I appreciate the thought and care, but this is the 1st time I've ever felt so confident about my weight loss journey and now she's made me terrified.

I've always had a good relationship with food. I love it and whilst I've done a few stupid crash diets in my time, this is the first time I feel committed to a diet and I'm actually enjoying it, but now I'm plagued with the thoughts that this will lead to an eating disorder of some kind. Anyone else feel the same? How do I prevent these thoughts and how do I ensure that my weight loss journey never leads me to this? I'm currently trying to eat healthier foods alongside the normal foods I eat and 2kg down, I'm feeling wonderful. But she has made me terrified of this. "
"CICO/ BMR question 37F, SW:367.7, CW: 289.6 GW: ?? Below 225 lbs

I’ve been using MyFitnessPal as a tracker, and it has had my daily calories at around 1900 for the past several months for 2 lbs/ week. I played with the goals today and it dropped my daily calories down to 1500 ish for the same 2 lbs/week loss. 
I’m confused on how safe this might or might not be. My BMR calculates to around 1900/ day. Google says don’t go below the BMR at risk of being hungry, muscle loss, and lowered metabolism. But I didn’t feel like I was losing much at 1900 before. It was only about 1 lb/week. I absolutely want to fit into a kayak by August- and that means 40 lbs in 5 months. 

Can I just eat the calories for 1900 daily, and then exercise so the net is below the 1500? Or does that cause issues health wise and I need to stick to the net 1900 per day?

"Question about measurements Hi! So I (F25 5ft2) currently weigh 200lbs after some serious lockdown weight gain and am very much not happy with my appearance any more. My waist now measures 40 inches, the circumference around my bellybutton is 43 inches, my upper arm circumference is 15.5 inches etc. I want to just be able to fit in my clothes again, I don’t care how much I weigh. 

I want to lose 4 inches from my waist and belly, to restore them to my (still overweight but happy and confident) pre-lockdown size. 

I run approximately 1km a day. I had been doing this before the pandemic but fell off when we entered lockdown last March. I will also be doing between 30 and 60 minutes of power yoga every day, depending on my schedule. 

How long will it take me to lose those inches? Should I change my routine?

Thanks!!"
"Stress eaters - What are your tricks to staying consistent? Is anyone else a stress eater? 

I tell my g/f that if she see's me eating a lot of Chipotle in a week, that something is wrong, and she should checkin on me. That's how it has always been for such a long time. I realized this about 15 years ago, I had a friend pass away, and the fast food bill was insane. I eat my feelings. 

I also work in a stressful job. Some days I can't control myself, I get a fuck it all attitude, and I justify what I'm doing, then I feel like shit after (and during...). And the truth is I actually know I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing for why I'm doing it while doing it. The guilt is there, and I know I should just turn around and go back home, but, I rarely do.

I've lost the weight, gained it back, lost it again, gained it back. I fall off the wagon pretty hard when I'm stressed out and I stay there until I get sick of myself again. 

If any of this sounds like you and you successfully combated this, what are your pro tips in helping stay on track?"
"Internal battle I’m having such a hard time being motivated. I’m only on Day 10, and the first month is the hardest for me. I’m 5’8 and my starting weight is 184. My week one weigh in I was at 182. Last night I was with a friend and ate/drank more than I have, and this morning I was back at 184 (I understand it’s water weight for the most part and was only at 1,680 calories for the day). I just feel like I’ve been so focused on calorie counting and measuring all of my food when I could literally eat whatever I want and stay at 184. I’ve been focusing on slow and sustainable weight loss and eating around 1500 calories a day. I’ve always worked out and do 30-60 minutes on the peloton 4-5 times I week. Sometimes I want to give up and just be fat and happy. I know that I want to stick with my weight loss and health goals, and will continue because the results will come. I just feel so deflated sometimes. Ugh can anyone else relate??"

"Plateau in my journey M21 5""8 SW226 CW185 GW160

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys!

&amp;#x200B;

So I've reached a plateau in my weight loss journey. I have been the same weight for 2 months. I track calories and generally eat healthy (fruits, mostly protein, not a lot of carbs). In regards to exercise I either go on a 4.5 km run or do a strength training session at the gym. But I have been running for those 2 months and I cannot seem to lose weight. FYI my TDEE says I have a Basal Metabolic Rate of 1719 calories per day and that my maintenance calories are 2900! I rarely eat 2900 calories but still I cannot seem to budge the scale anymore. Does anyone have any tips? Or do you think I will eventually lose weight if I keep exercising how I am exercising and tracking calories? 

Also does anyone have any recommendations on what my calorie intake should be? I am sure around 1700-2000 is reasonable. I know calorie trackers in regards to exercise are not necessarily accurate but let's just pretend they were - that would mean if I ate 1700 calories (my metabolic rate) and then kept exercising (i track with an apple watch that I burn 350 cals on a 30 min run, and 500 cals at the gym) I should probably start to lose weight, no?

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know your thoughts!"
"Second time trying to lose weight and it feels really hard. Hi. I just wanted to share my experience here. I started off around 85is kilos. At my peak, I must have been like 96kg. Anyways, in a year I lost around 25-30 kilos. And well it felt damn awesome. 

I became so obsessed with CICO and eating at a deficit didn't even feel difficult. It  became natural to eat healthy. As a matter of fact, I almost hated junk food like chips, etc. They tasted bland to me. People didn't like my appearance.. and looking back I feel like I must have done a bit too much. At my lowest exactly two years ago, I was 61kg with out any muscle.

Now, after that, in the summer of 2019, I joined a gym and it actually turned out well. I seemed healthy and I actually felt like a looked better for some reason. 

This was until the pandemic. I actually lost like 3 kilos during the lockdown. Then, I moved back home and my eating habits got ruined. I ated junk all the time. I gained 10 kilos in 4 months. And then I moved out of there. Simply, because I was scared that if I stay there long, I will get fat again. 

I have been trying to lose it since then,but man is it hard. It's really hard. I have actually put on 5 kilos since coming here.(not entirely fat as I have been working out a lot). 

Today, I weighed myself, I am just 1kg shy of 80. And I immediately started on deficit. It's so hard rn,but I have to keep at it. I don't have any other choice. None of clothes fit me. I can't even run a mile now. It will be tough,really tough but have to do it. 

Tbh, if you ask me if I look better now than when I am at my lowest, I would say now. It's amazing how ""bigger"" I was, when I was full of fat vs now when I have a little bit of muscle. And people wouldn't even say that I look fat or anything unless they see my weight. I dont even have a big gut. It's pretty flat honestly. I do have bloated face now. And people can tell I have gained weight.

Also, can anyone recommend me a Calorie Counting app? Myfp is good but i want to nutritional breakdown of each of my food and that requires premium version."
"Day 145 of CICO and down 22lbs - my journey so far! Hello! I'm a 5'4, 27F and here is my progress so far:
https://imgur.com/6YKoJuK.png

Here's what worked for me:
**Don't fret about fluctuations**. This is easier said than done but if you are sure that you are accurately tracking your calories in and out, the scales will eventually budge! You can see from my pic above that there has been multiple periods (weeks, even!) where I was stagnating at the same weight but it eventually worked out :) 

**It's ok to slow down if you need a break**. In the last 2 weeks I've recently started to eat more to give myself a break, as I was getting discouraged BUT I still maintained a deficit. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon and it's ok not to maintain such a strict deficit all the time, if it will help you get back on track

**Take note of the time of the month**. If applicable to you, don't fret if you retain more water or see sudden spikes due to your menstrual cycle. If I didn't read about it here, I would have freaked so much."
"I need help// turned to Reddit Hello!! I (19yo f) have been struggling lately. Gaining more and more weight (fat) and I’m done binge-watching YouTube videos of “how I lost 50lbs in 2 months” or trying to take advice from influencers that always seem to have something to sell.
So I’ve turned to the community here.
I am 5’5.5, around 185-190lbs (83.9kg) and I have a decent amount of muscle mass, just covered all over with some squish. Particularly in the problem areas like tummy, arms, waist, inner thighs- it feels like I’m the ‘fit’ me trapped inside a fat suit.
I have a hard time finding motivation when it’s just me, but all of my friends have amazing metabolisms and their only work-out is standing sometimes. 
I have no idea how many calories I should eat. I want to lose fat quickly, but I want to hold on to much of my muscle mass and do NOT want to slow my metabolism. I’ve damaged my metabolism through restriction and bingeing in the past, and I just need help with advice, calorie recommendations, etc.
ANY HELP WOULD BE SUPER APPRECIATED and I plan on being really active on here!!"
"I’m back with my sob story..again. These are just my scrambled thoughts, and somewhere to place them

Measurements: 5’8 SW: 180 CW: 150(?) GW: 135 I made a post a couple of weeks back about my weight and how no matter what I do, it doesn’t go down. I still feel like that. I stepped on the scale and got 151. That was odd. This past weekend I did go to an all weekend party but I tried to limit what I ate. I didn’t like that number 151 though. I stepped back in the scale and got 150.4. Then 149.6. Then back to 151. Maybe my scale is broken but I’m taking 149. This isn’t the problem though. The problem is me not losing weight.

I’ve been on this journey since august, and it’s been rough. I’ve lost 30 or so lbs., which is okay I guess. I don’t know why my last 15 aren’t coming off as easy as the first. It’s so stubborn and the fat is in the worst areas possible. What am I doing wrong? Well i’m really lacking on sleep. I’m getting around 4-5 hours a night. On the bright side, i’ve upped from 1500 calories to 1700 calories because i’m starting to incorporate HIIT and weight training into my weight loss 4-5 times a week. Even when on a calorie deficit, can I gain muscle? Maybe the scale stagnating is because of a muscle gain? I wish some magical deity would tell me what I’m doing wrong so I can fix it and get it off within the next three months. Is losing 15lbs. doable within 3 months? I don’t know. If you made it this far, thank you for reading and don’t be afraid to comment-it really helps."
"Anyone else feel like their body is working against them? So this week I weighed myself and gained two pounds!! I was beyond frustrated because I felt like I did everything right and better than the week before.

I started running this week instead of doing my usual HIIT workout and felt amazing. I can see myself becoming a runner. Anyways in my HIIT workout my fitness tracker says I burned around 475 calories and when running, my fitness tracker says I burned 680 in the same amount of time. I was feeling so happy and didn't indulge in sweets or snacks just more fruits and nuts. 

I was feeling hella pumped for weigh in day and was so disappointed that I gained two pounds even tho the week before I lost one pound and had two cheat days with no running just walking. And I slept way more this week also. The stars were aligned for me this week. 

However I did indulge in some pork yesterday and was told that the body takes digesting pork longer so its better to weigh yourself tomorrow for a better weight. 

Ive lost 52 pounds in 7 months with no supplements and I'm proud of that but these last 8 pounds have taken me two months to lose with maximum effort (exercising 6 times a week one hour a day) while the first 25 took me three months with less exercise and less restrictions and I was loving it. 

I've gone to the doctor and he says he can't get my blood work til June. So at this point, I really don't know what to do. Ive read people in similar situations say it's a hypothyroidism issue and I have every symptom they have but really wanted to confirm with the doctor first but I can't wait 3 months. 

Anyone else in a similar situation?"
"Exercise calorie deficit thoughts? Let me preface this by saying that I know my fitbit overestimates my calorie expenditure. I am 38F, cw 275 down from 325 in about a year. I spin 5 times a week and work with a personal trainer 3 times a week. I eat between 1600 and 1800 calories a day, everything is tracked. My question is this: on heavy double workout days where I spin in the am and lift in the evening, should I increase my intake or leave it as a higher deficit? My weight loss has been super slow but I am near 40 and only in the last 5 months really started to focus hard on my diet. And please don't tell me to workout less because I weirdly love it lol"
"Weight loss stall? Hi all. Since last November (2019) I have lost 47 pounds. I went from 175 ish and now am about 128-129. I started in January at 140 and hit 128 February 8th, but have now been stuck here. I lost the weight through staying around 1100-1300 cals with light exercise, and for the past few weeks i’ve been on 1200 with no change. I’m 5’5, 18, and count religiously, oil and everything, with cups + double weighed on a scale. I even took a diet break 2 weeks ago where I went around 1500 cals, and my weight maintained. I am 128-129 and want to be around 123/124, as I still have a decent amount of stomach fat. I do anywhere from 2-3 days of cardio (yesterday I walked 17k steps, randomly) and 2-3 days of lifting weight, I typically do squats and deadlifts 3x12 for about 50 pounds. Not much, I’m still learning. Anyways, my weight seems to be stuck and I have no clue what to do. I can’t go lower in cals and I drink about 3 Liters a day. Thank you!"
"How much can I(28M) truly help my younger sister(25F) with her weight? She's always struggled with her weight. Unfortunately within these past few years it's really spiraled.

This situation has left me thinking, "" Well, maybe she'd react differently hearing from me than my parents"", we are close, and I realize that there are things that you discuss with just the sibling that the parents aren't privy to and maybe this is one of those things. At the same time, maybe this is a serious enough issue that I should just sit back and let my parents deal with it, maybe they're more equipped than they realize and its best I leave it alone.

"Week four - comments and a question Hi good afternoon. I'm a 34 y.o. 6'1"" male and as of this morning I weigh 288.6 pounds. I'm on week four of a diet plan. What I'm doing is 1200 calories per day of huel, combined with 18:6 intermittent fasting. I eat 400 cal at 12pm, 3pm, and between 5-6pm. I'm pretty well settled into my routine, but the first few weeks were rough and I was bingeing on the weekends.

Here's my question: 2 days ago my partner bought me a new digital bathroom scale, which I'm very thankful for. I had been using a pretty crappy/old analog scale to track my weight, so I'm glad to have something more accurate. When I weighed myself for the first time I noticed the weight was about 10 pounds heavier than the old scale. My daily weight tracker looks very strange right now. I started at 300 pounds, lost weight to 284, then jumped back up to 293. I don't even know exactly what my starting weight was anymore. Moving forward will be no problem, but what should I do about the phantom weight for the first 3.5 weeks in my weight tracker app? Should I leave it as is, or should I estimate what it probably was? 

I want to be able to accurately analyze and communicate my weight loss journey, and I feel like I can't do that right now. I know this is probably a small thing, but its bothering me. I'm sure I'm not the first person who's encountered this. Any advice?"
"Milestone On my Weight loss Journey. SW: 365, CW: 238, GW: 195
Started August 2019 with a 4 month break early 2020. 
I have focused on calories in and calories out. I Exercise regularly. Anyone can do it you just have to make the choice and then stick with it for life. Weight has been my arch enemy my whole life. Once i understood the psychology of my weight loss struggle better i have had better success lowering it. 
I got an inexpensive tracking application for my phone and do my best to hold myself accountable.... I make mistakes but i just dust myself off and keep going. Those “mistakes” are just a moment in a longer journey that has to be for me A lifetime endeavor.

One of the biggest hurdles for me is when someone compliments my weight loss. It is a psychological subconscious trigger in my brain that i have won and you are finished. I have learned to not succumb to this trap. Tell them Thank-you but i haven’t accomplished my goal. Have a ways to go..

The second one for me is if i binge to say i quit Or say a screw it i might as well eat next day too i already screwed up the week.. it is falling back into old habits. And must be corrected asap.

Vegetables... lots of vegetables. Your snack foods are now veggies, and sometimes fruit. 

Oh and take a multivitamin.. and drink water . 

Sorry random thoughts

Ohh whats the goal you ask. I lost 1/3 of my total body weight... But i have a ways to go.

Wish me luck fellow losers!

Hope i inspire at least one person?!"
"My recent progress regarding my Binge Eating Disorder (BED) Hello reddit!


I hope you guys are all doing well! 

My whole life I'm suffering from a Binge Eating Disorder. Most of the time my way to fight it was completely restrict me from any trigger foods. My trigger foods are sweets. My level of BED is pretty intense. To give you an idea of what I'm going through I throw in some pictures.

[This is like almost 20k calories in sweets right there. That is maybe enough for two days.](https://i.imgur.com/umn9yvP.jpg)

[This is from just one day. And it doesn't even show the fast food I had on top.](https://i.imgur.com/v9J1GJ1.jpg)

Hopefully this is not too disturbing. Despite all these bad days last year and before that I made really good progress overall. Unfortunately towards the end of 2020 I gained close to 50lbs in just under two weeks. To anyone saying it's impossible. Well I'm sure the pics above will help you make this statement more reasonable haha. The weight I have gained is all gone in 2021 and some more 💪. So that's nice I guess. 


Anyway, I did achieve that by restricting myself from all kinds of sweets again. Funnily enough I'm studying nutritional science and home economics (B.Sc. Dietetics) and I've learned a lot of helpful things already in just a few months. I mean it is nice to completely cut out any sweets. Your body loves it as the sweets don't do anything for you really. Nontheless this way of dealing with my nutrition is just not sustainable longterm. Originally I had planned to do the no sweets thing during all of 2021. I'm sure that I can do it because I can be very determined but is it really good for me in every aspect!?

Close to valentines day last month I felt a little down for some reason and ended up buying sweets [as you can see here.](https://i.imgur.com/jZFiUo8.jpg)

I didn't even plan on eating them really. I mean the thought of eating all of it at once was on my mind for sure but my willpower was way too strong. Anyway, I know that I have to learn how to deal with those trigger foods in order to beat my disorder. I mean studies show for a good reason that less than 10% of people who lose big amounts of weight will regain. Numbers are actually way worse. But why is that? Many people are saying losing weight isn't the hardest part. It is maintaining a certain weight that is the real challenge. I don't say this to offend anyone who's struggling with weight loss! Losing weight is damn hard already, we all know that!

So but why do people think that maintaining is even harder? I think when you actively decide to lose weight you set rules regarding food and activity to reach a certain weight goal. People are good at understanding that they need to leave out bad foods and create a deficit to lose weight. That's the theory. So let's assume the goal weight was achieved. What comes after that? Most people throw away their weight loss rules as there is no more weight to lose. They stop restricting themselves to certain foods and bad habits are reestablished. Imo this just happens because we don't learn a sustainable way to deal with food. 

Coming back to my case. So I had all those sweets sitting next to me literally and I had no idea what to do with it. It's not like I was sitting there straving for some or even all of it. It was just there. After week 7 of 2021 was finished I told my alright, over the course of the next week you will eat both boxes of cereal. I have never until that day eaten just a part of a box of cereal. Even at 12 years of age I would grab the MEGA box of kelloggs and eat all in one go. I told myself you will have 100g of cereal every day and that's gonna be it. This is exactly what I have done! I have not overeaten during that week. Everything went fine. I even lost weight although there were thoughts of me cheating on my diet on my mind. But nope all good!

The day after that I had half a bag of the Haribo sweets. Writing that down still creates disbelief on my mind lol. Yea I had just had half the bag and the rest for the next day. For last week I did some different testing. In the past even when I was doing well having a cheat day and not just a cheat meal would result in me bingeing for a few days. I think a cheat day creates this thought of being a failure and for me it's really hard to recover from it. So most of the time I would think ah damn it doesn't matter anyway and I keep on bingeing for a few more days. 

So last week I intentionally set myself up for a cheat day. Not a cheat day of bingeing on foods but just a day where I could have whatever I wanted. Obviously I would make sure to have certain foods that I eat like every day to cover mirconutrients. So I knew on either saturday or sunday I would have like 5-10k calories very likely. Working towards that day I cut down on ~400 calories every day. To be fair my maintenance calories are somewhere between 3-3,5k a day (I'm pretty active guy) so 400 isn't all that much actually. Anyway it created a nice little buffer going into the cheat day. 

The cheat day came on sunday and I ended up having almost exactly 7k calories that day. I did weigh myself the next day and I was up like 4lbs or so. For the week I was probably still up a bit so I decided to go with 2k calories on monday and 2,5k calories on tuesday. I stuck to those numbers. My weight is back to normal and actually a little lower than what I weighed on last friday. Even though I had 3,4k calories yesterday. 

This cheat day thing was me testing the water basically. See how I would deal with the situation right now. How it would affect me. I mean it could have thrown me off completely and I would destroy all my hard work again. I think though having planned cheat days is really bad especially while dealing with an eating disorder. So I'll not recommend anyone to do what I did. Adding cheat meals though is completely fine. Just try to stay within your calorie limit. Allowing yourself to have bad foods is completely fine. I learned that while having the cereal every day for a week. My stomach was definately not amused by the sudden intake of sugar every day but it fine in the end.

Something else I want to mention is that implenting an anchoring technique can help a ton with your ED! I Couple weeks ago I had a NLP course and learned some really interesting things. I was basically using that tecnique already. I do a home workout like 6/7 days a week. Obviously motivation can be a problem at times especially when working on certain areas (for me it's back. It's annoying to work your back without being able to use gym machines). So back days are really annoying and my motivation is not the best. Nontheless I kind of implemented some sort of anchor to still make me fo for it almost every day.

Everyday after my workout I'll hav a huge bowl of yoghurt with fruits. Any by huge I mean like 1,5-2,5kg (4-5lbs). [Looks like this.](https://i.imgur.com/ZaSkik8.jpg) This was actually 2,6kg as I had a really busy day and didn't have time for breakfast. I used 1kg of low fat quark, 600g of frozen fruits + 400g of water, 5 bananas (400g), 1 apple (200g), ~20g of walnuts. It tastes amazing. I know after every workout I'll have this super amazing bowl! I personally think rewarding yourself with food is good but obviously the whole thing is super healthy and exactly what my body needs. [Another example of what I have after a workout.](https://i.imgur.com/r321xHM.jpg) This time less yoghurt/quark but 1kg of veggies. I eat like 1kg of fruits and 500g-1kg of veggies every day if someone is curious. 

This actually got a little longer than I like it to be but maybe there's helpful information for anyone. What helped me realising that I do it wrong by restricting myself was a bodybuilder who does youtube content. He is very transparent with what he eats and I was like damn he's having cereal every day and if macros allow it like snickers ice cream in the evening. He really inspired me that you can live in a healthy way even though you allow yourself to have treats here and there. This is exactly what I want. A sustainable, overall healthy way of dealing with food without restrictions regarding certain foods. Having the background of the eating disorder makes this hard of course but not impossible! I'll work hard to get better every day.

As a little conclusion. Our relationship to food should be sustainable to reach longterm success. Treats/bad foods are allowed in certain quantities. Even holidays/birthdays where you might eat more than you usual do can easily be implemented without worries about your progress. I wish everyone here all the best and that all of you reach their goals whatever it is! Nothing is impossible!

"Frustration. F24 5”9 SW:285 CW:240 GW:160 
So according to MFP, I’ve been logging my food every day for 232 days. I’m feeling pretty bummed out cause I feel I’ve been consistent, I’m using a food scale, I’m trying to overestimate calories when I can’t get an exact measurement. I thought by this time I’d be around 60lbs lost, with my goal being to hit 80lbs lost by the one year mark, but that seems pretty unlikely though. MFP says that as long as I’m eating less than 1800 calories a day then I should be losing about 1 pound a week. I’ve been eating less than that so I can lose faster, but never less than a 1000! Most of the time my weeks average around 1300 - 1500 calories. I found that around the beginning of February/ end of January I had started to plateau at my current weight, so I decided to try to stick more closely to 1400 calories. I’m still stuck. Is it possible that by doing too much of a calorie deficit I’ve stunted my metabolism? I thought even if that was the case cutting more calories would still show some results. I’ll admit I haven’t been the most consistent when it comes to exercise. I find it really hard to exercise regularly all by myself, and no one in my household ever wants to work out or even go for a walk with me. The only exercise I’ve ever really enjoyed doing by myself is swimming, but the pool by my house is still closed. I’ve been trying to do some resistance training, just following along to some YouTube videos, but it leaves me so sore and unmotivated the next day. 
I know the key with all of this is to stick through it, I’m just frustrated. Thought I’d be a lot further along by now than I am. It’s really hard not to compare my progress to some of you guys on here, y’all are doing so good! 
Sorry, needed somewhere to let this out. The people around me are well meaning but don’t offer the healthiest weight loss advice...
I’m not the first person to plateau, so if any of you guys have any advice for staying motivated during one, I’d really appreciate it."
"Hello, I'm New Here and Need MOTIVATION! First time poster here... 

I am having trouble finding the motivation and/or willpower to get back on track. A little bit about myself: 

I am 34 years old, 5'8"", and currently at 187lbs. Two years ago, I was at 195lbs and fed up with how I felt/looked. I am not sure what got into my head, but I just decided one day to make a change. I started out just counting calories and walking on the treadmill. I was seeing SMALL changes, but not to my satisfaction. I did my research and decided on a keto diet. I went HARD on keto for 8 months (along with daily exercise - yoga and treadmill) and lost 40lbs. I felt great. I had my days where I missed bread and beer, but I even made it through the holidays without falling off the wagon. At that time, my weight started to plateau, because I got lazy. I found excuses not to work out, and summer was coming, so I wanted to be able to enjoy picnic foods/beer with friends. 

Then, COVID happened. I was working from home and couldn't go out. I sat at home and worked from my couch. I snacked all the time, because it was there. I literally stopped caring about my weight/health because it was easier to be lazy. I continuously was gaining weight, and every once in awhile I'd think ""What am I doing"" and would decide to eat better and exercise. This would last a day or two. Then I'd be back to bad habits. I'm back in the office now, and find myself going to McDs at least 2x a week. Even though I tell myself that morning that this day will be different. 

I am just at a loss right now. I'm at a place where I know I need to get back on the diet/exercise train (my clothes don't fit, I feel sluggish, I don't feel like I look good), but I can't find that motivation/willpower I had before. I don't THINK it's depression (I am diagnosed, but have a steady/working medication management), but that could be a factor. 

I'm just looking for somewhere that I can work with others and share my feelings, goals, accomplishments, and setbacks. I am hoping this is the right place. I kept saying that I was going to start doing better, but maybe by putting it out here in the reddit-verse, I will feel held accountable."
"I gained 90 pounds in 6 months. How to go back? Hi, i wasnt always fit, more like i was just that big guy at 6f2i and about 170 pounds. I eat a lot, like a lot, but i wasnt getting fat because i was always doing something, walking everywhere, running sometimes, bicycling everyday,  in one day i would have about 30k+ steps.  After corona began i stayed home at first, i went from 170 to 190 in about 3 weeks because of lack of movement. Staying home made me anxious and i started using xanax, in no time i was total addict and i can say i was junkie, but with this, i did not gave a damn about staying home, i was outside everyday, going from place to place with no meaning, i did not eat much, i was starving a lot, but under influance i had no idea. in about 3 weeks i went from 190 to 150 pounds. I was getting a bit skinny and i liked it, i went to rehab because of my addiction, i almost lost my living, i sold my TV and most of my clothes to get money for xanax.  After 2 month rehab i was back, no need for xanax, but i just cant loose weight. Since i stoped with xanax i started eating, maybe to fulfill my addiction with another one. After  4 months of sobriety (2 months rehab 4 months on my own) I went from about 150 pounds to my todays 234 pounds.

I dont have enough power to keep myself from eating alot, think its maybe one of the reasons i never went back to xanax that destroyed me.

I tried lot of diets but i just cant keep with it.. If i dont eat enough (enough for me is about 4000 calories atleast) i start to feel hungry and i just cant think about nothing else then me sleeping on a sidewalk totaly out of it drugged up.. It literaly makes me super anxious..

My question is -  Am I able to loose 60 pounds which is my goal with just simple excercises? I have pretty much no stamina because of astma, i cant do even 1 push up because i have no movement, i work from home and also study from home, not a lot of free time.

I need some advice for simple excercises and im willing to try a simple diet.. i just dont want to be this fat (230 pounds is maybe not that extreme but i have literaly no muscles, carrying a bag of groceries is like powerlifting for me).

Thanks people of reddit, much love."
"Day 1 Think it’s time to accept I’m obese, BMI is 38.2. I’m 5’2” and 207.6lbs. 

It makes me sad. I feel unworthy as a partner and a mother. I need to be healthier for the sake of my health, self esteem, and my child. I want to be around longer than my dad was. 

What I’ll aim for is to 
get 5000 steps daily at first (I got a deck screw right through my foot and it’s still recovering)
Track my calories and aim for 1300 daily (worked out tdee) 

Maybe I’ll check in on this thread too. Keep me accountable. I’m not going to set a date for the loss, but it just needs to happen however long it takes. I’ve got 80lb to get off.

Here we go"
"I need help Hi everyone, I’m on mobile so my formatting might be a bit poo. 

Let’s start from the beginning. I grew up in an abusive household, looks were everything, I developed binge eating and also starving myself throughout my high school years. 

I had a baby after losing 3 stone, down to 13st. Since having my child I’ve been kind of the same since between 12st 7lb and 13st 7lb

However since this lockdown which I started at 12st 7lb I am now 14st 11.6lb. 

I hate myself which then leads me to emotionally eat. I feel unattractive, unfit, I get breathless easily. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to keep going."
"What is the most efficient way of ""reverse-dieting""  So a bit of context, I am a Male 21 years old at 6ft 2 currently at 155 pounds.

I started off my dieting and fitness journey 8 months ago, where I weighed 224 pounds. I did this by cutting my calories down to 1500 a day and have done so ever since. However, I have now realised I have got down to a very low weight for my height so am looking to start going into maintenance so I can focus on building muscle in the gym.

The issue is all the gyms are closed until April the 12th, which means I can't do any sort of workout and my main concern is that if I start to increase my calories up to 2000 a day too quickly I am going to put my weight back on. 

I would just like some advice off any other users who have gone from the experience of increasing calories after going on quite an extreme diet.

Many thanks."
"Yipeee reached my Goal Hi all,

After failing multiple times I have finally reached my goal. I am 78 kgs today :)

I started at 84kgs. I am using the HealthifyMe app to track calories it has items that are consumed on a  daily basis in my country. The only issue I faced was with constipation. I have included corn ladyfinger, cabbage other veggies in my diet but I still seem to face the issue. Also I tried 85% dark choclate and I felt very bloated and uneasy the next day.

Its been 50 days since pizza or garlic breads or kfc chicken, when I do get the urges I use an Airfryer to make french fries. 

I tried the eating junk food but I just couldnt keep my portions small. I felt super agitated knowing the choclate bar or.pizza slice is still in the fridge

It felt easier without even tasting them, its almost like I had a taste I needed tp have more but when I dont have it I am chill no twitches or some sort anxiety.

I also reduced my goals to max 2  avoiding mental strain has helped a huge deal in cutting down my eating.
The many goals then failure was major factor in the way I eat.

My next goal is to build muscle and have a good physique..

Mental health is something I am working on too."
"After a rough several months trying to start over again I recently lost both my job and my grandfather. Losing my grandfather was way worse, but losing my job screwed me over mentally given the circumstances around how I was let go. Before everything, I was on track - counting calories, exercising consistently, and I was starting to fit pants I hadn't been able to wear since before COVID started. I haven't gained any weight since the last time I weighed myself (back in January before everything happened) but my clothes are way tighter and there is fat in places I didn't really have them before. It's likely I lost the muscle mass and gained fat instead. I'm just also bloated from all the crap I was eating. 

I know the weight gain was from my severe depression and anxiety - I was literally sitting in a corner of my couch eating bags of chips and cookies a day for about 2/3 months straight. I'm still depressed honestly, but I'm striving to keep moving on and getting back on track. It's really hard though because now, on top of all that has happened, I really hate the way I look in the mirror. And its so hard for me to not grab parts of my body and just...hate that I can grab a handful. 

I've gotten back to the gym and have gotten rid of all the junk food I've accumulated. I'm cooking my own food again and starting to enjoy getting into shape, but I'm just so scared that one day I'll get really unmotivated again. 

Does anyone have any advice to stay motivated and not spiral? I understand that therapy is the best option, but I'm unemployed so sadly I can't go to one (I would love to though)."

"Weight gain after being injured for over a year Hey everyone, I’m new here 😌 My issue is still being diagnosed, but as I type this out my knee is throbbing with sort of an achey pain. I have an MRI tomorrow. When I was working out regularly, my right knee has always been the weaker one, but now it’s to the point where the pain is constant, even while I’m sitting (and it’s amplified by movement) Today I weighed in at 244 (!!!). due to quarantine and my injury I thought I had gained maybe 15 as my clothes were becoming tight, but not a whopping 30! At this point I’m fed up. I wear the weight well (at 5’0) but that number is really shameful. Can anyone give me some tips 😔 much appreciated!"
"I am an irrational sleep eater. Ugh So first off, I am 5’1 and about 152lbs. I meal prep for my week and every day averages around 1300-1400 calories. I also workout 5-6 times a week which is normally a cardio workout (heart rate anywhere between 150-180) for about 20-30 minutes.
I’ve been waking up and being half asleep stumbling into my kitchen and grabbing a quick snack. I vaguely remember it in the morning but I literally can’t stop doing it. It sounds so ridiculous but I can’t figure out how to stop myself hahaha 
Do I need to up my calorie intake? Should I eat a little snack to satiate me before bed? Any advice or help is appreciated"
"I(26F, 5'7, 267 lb) am not getting encouragement from my family on my weight-loss journey I can't go a day it feels like without my parents, either bluntly, or subtly, bringing up my weight, and doing it negatively. It's always got this aura of, "" You did this to yourself, you wouldn't be 130 pounds overweight if you'd listened to us"", like, I get it, what I have done for years has consequences and now I'm setting out to right the wrong but, I get no credit, no encouragement. Even my positives become negative. If I eat healthy for 4 days, it becomes this "" had you not cheated 5 days ago, it'd be 5 days in a row instead of 4."" I get that they're worried for my health, possibly mad at me for getting myself in this spot, and I find myself angry at me too, but, I'm trying to change. Rather than bash me when I fall, why not cheer when I'm up. I don't get why they're wired like this, makes me want to just give up and roll over.

How do I approach them in a constructive way?

TLDR: Parents make me feel awful because of my weight"
"NSV: Recognized my old disordered eating habits Non-scale victory, even though it doesn't feel like a victory: recognized old disordered eating habits and decided to make a change.

I started typing this up on the daily thread, and it got so long, and I know there's other folks on here who also have a history of disordered eating, and maybe it will resonate with some of you. But this is my first post so if this is an inappropriate solo post or in the wrong place please let me know!

I got out of the shower today and realized literally all I've been thinking about all day is calories, macros, calories, macros, entering my calories, macros, planning my calories for tomorrow. it's been like this for a few days, and today I saw it for what it is. It's the same disordered patterns of thinking that haunted me during my teens and again in my early twenties and now they're back again. 

I've been tired, dragging, and miserable in my body for the past few days. I've been eating 1100 calories and thinking ""I'm not hungry anymore"" even though I've been exercising every day. I've been wondering why I felt so bad when the weather was so nice and I had finally gotten through my weight plateau.

It seems pretty obvious to me now: I was not eating enough and obsessing over the food I did eat.

I don't want to me miserable again. I don't want to lose weight at the cost of all my mental health. I had been doing so good! I've been doing CICO for almost three months and it's been working and I've been happy - not feeling deprived or obsessive. I hit a (small) plateau recently, and I think that really brought on a lot of my obsessive thinking. So, I'm going to take a break from tracking and weighing for (at least) a week.

Honestly, though, I'm just so sad right now. I thought I was better than this now. I thought I had healed from my obsessive thinking. and now it's back. But, unlike before, I saw it. I recognized it. I decided that this time, the obsession and misery will not win. This time it different. I am choosing to be healthy physically AND mentally as I lose weight."
"Know what I’m supposed to do but can’t do it. What does everyone know that I don’t? I’m 24F 5’7. and currently at 88.5 kg (195 lbs). I had thyroid cancer which probably contributed to me suddenly gaining a lot of weight. I underwent a pretty big surgery (and a few comolications) a little over a year ago. My plan was to shed the weight after surgery but things got complicated. Between recovery from having my throat literally slit and the pandemic I couldn’t workout consistently or bring myself to cook healthy meals. 

The point is, looking in the mirror makes me want to cry but I can never follow through with diets!! I was seeing a nutritionist and had gone down to about 84 kg (185 lbs) but her meal plan was honest to god plain sad. I was supposed to eat eggs and steamed veggies like 6 times a week and she was basically a bully. I know there’s thousands of info online and good meal plans but I always give up after a few weeks and I am a master at making excuses for myself. I’m a devoted reader of this sub and I don’t think anyone could give me any piece of advice for weightloss I haven’t read or heard about before. I just want to know how you guys just get up and do what you’re supposed to do and then KEEP DOING IT in the long run!??

(Sidenote: I do go to therapy and although I’ve discovered a lot about myself I don’t think I’ve gotten to the root of the problem psychologically) I honestly think I’m just lazy and prefer eating delicious and unhealthy food. 

My neck has finally completely healed so I started to go back to my old crossfit gym. I am obviously out of shape and can’t take a lot of cardio but I can get through most routines just fine. I know exercise will get easier with time and I am slowly working up from going 3x to going 5x a week but I know it’s basically useless without proper diet. Am I being too hard on myself? Or is that me excusing myself again?

What are consistency/motivation/discipline tips? 
My biggest issues are portion control and being too lazy to cook for myself so end up eating whatever crap I can throw together quickly or just order food. 

Sorry for the long post I just needed to vent because I just weighed myself and feel so frustrated."
"Lost nearly 70 lbs 2 years ago.... today I looked at the scale and I'm nearly back at my starting weight. Like the title says... about 2 years ago, I went from 404 lbs, the heaviest I've ever been, and through going on daily walks and CICO, I dropped down into the 330s after about 4 months. I had never felt better. At at about 1600 a day (sometimes going over). I felt full of energy, felt like so much more confident. Then one day, about 4 months in... I just stopped. 

I remember what I was doing that day. I was driving home from work and drove past a McDonalds. I don't know why, but impulsively went through the drive through and got a double quarter pounder meal (large of course) and a 5 piece chicken select. I fucking sat there in my car and ate it all in less than 10 minutes. After that day, I never could keep up CICO for more than 3 days. 

Today, I stepped on the scale again and I'm all the way back up to 397. I feel defeated. I feel disgusting. I feel like I'm going to die. This fucking sickness that I can't beat is going to kill me early. I just had my daughter in November. She's 4 months old, and I'm terrified that I'm going to have a heart attack by the time I'm 40 and I'm never going to get to see her become an adult. 

Even knowing this... even having this fear. I just feel so helpless. Why can't I get back to whatever I was doing those 4 months? I felt so GOOD. Why can't I just do it? It doens't help that I work in a restaurant where I'm surrounded by food all day. It's so easy to just fill my cup with soda all day every day. All the messed up mistakes in the back free for the taking. I always tell myself I wont have any but next thing I know I'm just shoving it down my throat. 

I guess this is a venting thread. I don't know what else to do. I dont want to let myself break 400 again but I feel so helpless."
"What do you eat after a workout? &amp; Staying motivated? I’m about at my calorie intake, but I’m feeling a little hungry. Normally I’d eat a PB sandwich, but today I had a heavier lunch.

Something I’ve struggled with is my cravings especially after a work out. After a good, strong workout I grave these 300 calorie 40g sugary dunkin’ donuts bottled iced coffees. They’re my weakness, my biggest weight loss journey was -20 pounds &amp; that’s when I stopped drinking those things.

I’m back to being on track, and I want to stay on track. Right now, I’m addicted to the feeling my body feels after a workout. I also ran my fastest mile today, 14:02 minutes. If it weren’t for the mask, I think I could’ve been faster but I couldn’t get breaths to keep going lol.

Anyway, what do you eat after a work out? I know I’ll get bored of PB sandwiches soon &amp; I don’t want to end up binge eating. “Moderation” isn’t a thing for me. I either have to not do it or I do it 100%, there is no 30% for me."
"Pants Hey mods, let me know if this is too outside the scope of the sub. But I need some help. 


I’ve had two kids. Two c-sections. I can lose weight everywhere but my doctor said at this point, my excess skin in my stomach is there to stay unless it’s surgically removed. So what do you do about work pants? I can’t find pants that work with both my stomach and excess skin, but fit the rest of me where I’ve lost weight. So you buy to fit the waist? Legs? and deal with a muffin top? Even leggings are a struggle for fit. Since many deal with the excess skin issue, how do you deal with the fit of pants? Tailoring could be an option, but mostly thinking off the rack."
"How do I do it for real this time? Hey everyone.

This isn't an easy post for me to make because I've restarted so many times, I can't keep count. It's always a new cycle of starting over, overeating, and then gaining all the weight back anymore. Two days ago I stepped on the scale and reached my highest weight of 148 lbs at 5'4.5 or 5'5. I am on the track team at my college, but my weight has stopped me from breaking my own personal records. I used to be 110 at 5'4.5 or 5'5 in high school when I was at my prime speed. I got really sick over the summer, and was on medication that makes you gain weight. However, it isn't just the medication. When I came into college, I started eating like absolute shit. 

I entered a cycle of binging on pizza, fries, cookies, and ice cream. Sometimes it would happen multiple times per day. I remember in high school, I used to eat a bunch of fruit, chicken salads, and a protein/rice combo every single day. I had a really hard time adjusting to the food at college because it was so different from what I was used to eating.

I really want to start over for real this time, and take accountability for my actions as well. I am considering posting every single week to update on my journey. I don't want to track my calories as that has led to heavy restriction and binging in the past. What are some unusual tips that have helped you lose weight for real this time? Please feel free to go into detail and elaborate, not just I ate less and exercise more. How did you get into the right headspace to losing all the weight.

I feel like a failure. I don't like the way I look in my new body. I have zero self confidence. I need to lose approximately 35-40 pounds. 

I'm ready for a new change, I just don't know how I'll do it.

TLDR: After 2 years of constant failing, I am finally turning to reddit. I need help losing weight. Please comment down below your tips, feel free to go into detail and elaborate."
"Weight loss, pregnancy, and progress markers I started losing weight before I got pregnant because I wanted to have more energy and mobility to take care of a future kid. I started keeping track of what I was eating and trying to do some sort of exercise every day (which, for me, results in exercising about five days a week on average, since there are some days when it just doesn’t happen). It was working, I was feeling better and better, and I got pregnant! Yay!

So now I’m in my second trimester, the stage where you want to be putting on at least some weight, regardless of where you started. I’ve kept up with the routine, increasing my total calories for baby-growing, and I think it’s still having lots of benefits. But I do miss having the decreasing number on the scale to show my progress. And I’m at a point where movement is starting to become gradually more difficult, which feels a bit like regressing, even though I know it’s not. I’m confident that healthy habits are contributing to making my pregnancy easier, even though getting more pregnant feels a lot like getting out of shape again.

My question is this: what other milestones do you notice or keep track of when it comes to eating well and exercising, besides weight loss? Bonus points if it’s also disconnected from feeling more energetic and graceful, which I love, but are not really applicable right now. Would love to hear your thoughts!"
"Healthy ways to get back on the wagon? Okay so I've been doing awesome until today when, after getting accidentally glutened when my partner misread a box, I decided to eat half of a butter tart his mom dropped off around lunch time. 

Normally, I don't touch gluten because I have celiac. Even when my partner makes a frozen pizza, I don't touch it and it takes no effort to not eat any. But because I got accidentally glutened, I ended up making a bad choice. 

The question is: what's the healthiest way to get back on the wagon? Do I just go back to what I was supposed to normally eat for dinner? Or do I ""make up"" for the calories by eating less/nothing for dinner?

I have an impulse to skip dinner and ""make up"" for the calories of the tart. But it occurred to me to ask, because many of my food-related impulses are unhealthy. Halp?"
"I walked a 10K today I just started seriously getting back into focusing on my health as it starts warming up here, and I've been doing CICO and exercising almost daily with pilates and/or walking with my dog. I live in a city with not a ton of sidewalks in areas, so I've been stuck in my neighborhood with sidewalks and spent the entire summer and again recently walking the same loop, familiarizing myself with a little routine I looked forward to (the people who always were out on their porch at the same time, the kid who always rides his bike, Lucky the dog that always want to say hi to me, Starlord who constantly escapes his house) and I was okay with it for months.

Well, yesterday, I found a hidden little sidewalk on Google maps that led to another neighborhood across the road, and today my dog and I walked it and my own neighborhood for a grand total of 6.22 miles in less than 2 hours.

No, it wasn't a real race or anything, but it's the longest distance I've ever completed. I'm already sore and will be even more so tomorrow, but I did it!"
"Where should I get started? I am 20 M  moved out last year to Canada for a job. Never really been independent and was eating out for the most part and became overweight.(96 kg) Recently, I have been feeling really unhealthy, losing hair, got big bags under my eyes, skin problems and such. Also I have a family history of diabetes so i have also been very scared recently. 
So, I want to get started on eating healthy and cutting on calories and working out more. But I just can’t find a place to start. I have never really cooked a lot, I make one or two meals and back to junk. Any guide that I look up is always some random brand trying to make me sign up for a subscription without really telling me anything. 

I have some friends who work out and I have started going to the gym with them but all of them tell me different things.So I am a bit confused.

Any suggestions for a starting point for an absolute beginner. Some app with workout routines and some other with meal plans and recipes, preferably with grocery lists. 
Any help would be really appreciated and you might just change my life or even save it i guess."
"Anyone here been able to gain muscle while losing weight? Sorry if this is the wrong page, but I need advice. I’m a 26yo male, 5’ 8” and 190 lbs. 

Body fat isn’t super high but I definitely want to “trim up”. I’m also trying to gain as much muscle as I can while doing so, but for now my priority is losing the stubborn fat that I carry around my waist. I used an equation online to determine that my maintenance calories are right at 3,000 per day. I’ve been using the MyFitnessPal app and have been eating around 2200-2400 a day, so a 600-800 cal deficit. However, I have been eating 200g a protein a day and I’ve been weightlifting 6 days a week.

Has anyone been on a weightlifting routine like this while eating at a small deficit? Did you gain muscle?"
"Lost about 10lbs, struggling with losing more Hey everyone, I've been a frequent lurker but everyone's posts on here inspire me so much! 

I'm 5'6 and weighed about 185lbs at my peak, before the pandemic. During the summer of 2020, I managed to get that down to 175lbs somehow, and since October 2020, I've been struggling and swinging between 174 and 169lbs. I'm so frustrated with this plateau, it hasn't shifted in months.

I'm trying to figure out what to do differently. I've always ate healthy and usually don't eat bread. My main carb is some rice. Sometimes I have a sweet item but I keep the portion small and have been doing IF for about 2 months. Still no change. I'm not sure what I could do to shake up my routine and get this weight moving again because I exercise a few times a week and only eat 2 or 2.5 meals a day.

My first goal weight is to get to 160lbs, and then eventually reach 130. The lowest I've gotten is 145lbs, so I'm trying to take this bit by bit. Any tips help because I'm frustrated but also very stubborn!"
"I'm down 20 lbs today!!! (CICO) Started actively trying to lose weight in late November after my partner and I set a date for our wedding. I had previously (in 2017) lost almost 60 lbs, but I quickly gained it back and more. But I'm so proud that I'm finally down 20 lbs! I even took February off from actively calorie counting.

I'm trying to find a balance between calorie counting and intuitive eating... I lost all my weight earlier from CICO exclusively (while in school aka very sedentary) and I found once I STOPPED counting, the weight just went up. So this time around I'm trying to focus on having more balance in the foods I'm eating, doing things like having fruits or vegetables in every meal. I'm also much more active this time around now that I have a dog. Every day we're out for an hour walk, and on my days off from work we go snowshoeing!! I also exercise more frequently now that I found something that I like (emkfit on YouTube is fabulous!!).

Anyway, I'm excited and wanted to share! Thanks for reading :)"
"Today is the day I start my journey to a healthier and happier me. (24m/196cm/168kg) I've been on this sub for years and I've thought about posting this post many times. I've written it out constantly but never posted (only backspaced out of it and gave up on my attempts a few days/weeks later) 

Today that changes. Today I start to be accountable for my actions, my weight, my health, and my happiness.

To get me there, I have achievements for all of my goal weights. 

Today: 168kg/370lbs.

GW1: 159kg/350lbs. I can take a few day vacation
GW2: 150kg/330lbs. I can fit on a motorcycle
GW3: 136kg/300lbs. I can enjoy skiing again
GW4: 125kg/275lbs. I can fit in my dream car
GW5: 114kg/250lbs. I can fit in my dream rowing boat
Final: 100kg/220lbs. I can go skydiving for the first time

My plan to achieve this:

Inputs:
CICO with low carb. I did keto during college for a month and it worked wonders but I failed to start up again after a slip. I plan to take steps to make sure this is a lifestyle change rather than a diet or fad. I will take it way slower than before.

Outputs:
Just got an erg from concept2. Rowed a 2k tonight and plan to use that split for steady state rowing 3-4 days per week after work. Once again, not rushing, but slowly building up. I also plan to go on walks around the neighborhood with my wonderful, beautiful and supporting partner after she gets home from work. 

Alright. I guess no backing out now."
"Hungry? Fruits and veggies are the ANSWER 
Growing up my mom always told me to eat an apple if I was craving junk food. I hated that advice!!!

However...

I am realizing that I can eat TONS of fruits and veggies for very little calories. And since I HATE feeling hungry this has been a life saver.

Just now, I was feeling hungry but accounting for dinner in a few hours I only had 150 calories left for the day. I have some healthier prepackaged snacks like popcorn for 100 calories, but I like to save at least 100 calories for the evening when I feel snacky before bed.

First I said to myself “you can wait 2 hours til dinner”. But then I remembered snapping at my husband the other day because I was hangry. So nope not gonna wait.

Second I said, “well I can have a grilled cheese sandwich and cut back on dinner to make up for it”. I know I’m not gonna be good at cutting back on dinner so also not an option.

THEN I realized.... I could eat a salad. 2 cups of pre chopped lettuce is 20 calories. 1 tbsp of dressing is 20 calories. Sprinkled with some seasonings.

Now I’m satisfied but not too full for dinner and have plenty of calories left for a pre bed time snack!!!

Other low cal fruits and veggies I’ve been enjoying:

- riced cauliflower with garlic salt, pepper, and drop of sesame oil

- Pre sliced apples. Dunno why but when they are pre sliced I’m more likely to grab them

- veggie soup from scratch (example: onions, carrots, celery, mushrooms, cabbage in a beef or chicken broth)

- bananas

- tangelos

- baby carrots

Any other low cal snacks (especially including fruits and veggies) that have helped you stay full between meals?"
"Am I on the right track? I’m new to Reddit and a few years ago I decided that I needed to make a change. I went from 235 to about 215. I’ve maintained the weight for about 2 years and lately I’ve been not feeling too confident. In the past I lost weight from simply cutting portions. But now I want to lose more to feel better. I run/walk on a steep incline treadmill for 1 hour for 5-6 days a week. My diet mainly consists of proteins and fats, and instead of soda or other beverages I stick to water, milk, or kombucha. Please help me, I honestly don’t know anything about losing fat, I’ve only had success with maintaining weight. Is this a proper diet to lose fat? Is cardio enough to lose fat?"
"30 Day Accountability Challenge - Day 10 Hello losers,

Wednesday. Getting to it! In my neck of the woods, we're about to get some serious snow. Maybe. Ahhh weather science.

Weigh in daily, enter in Libra &amp; report here even if I don’t like it: 234 this morning, 231.1 lbs trend weight.

Stay within calorie range (1800): Someone, come slap some sense into me. Oofta. 3/8 days.

Exercise 5 days a week: Rest day. 9/10 days.

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, nonfood rewards): Update, feeling feels still sucks. Other note, did some adulting errands on my lunch break, go team executive functioning!

Try a new recipe once a week: Roasted romanesco &amp; sausage sammiches with grilled veggies. 2/4 weeks.

Express mindfulness and or gratitude: Today I'm grateful for being up and swinging, even if I'm full of questionable food choices. I've been reading a lot about not letting the body you currently have stand in your way of doing things on your some day list. Lots of stuff about accepting &amp; loving your body no matter what. I can love &amp; accept this body even when it's still a work in progress. It's a tough gig. But worth doing!

Your turn kids!"
"1200 calorie diet not okay? Admittedly I'm a little worried?  I'm starting to see posts saying that the 1200 calorie diet is not healthy for weight loss and that it might lead to rapid loss but mess up your body.  It does help me lose weight fast when I follow it (admittedly I have trouble committing, this time around I'm really buckling down though), but I always assumed that's because I have a lot of excess weight to lose.  I've also been doing research into calorie maintenance levels and for my goal weight and current weight and to maintain my goal i would have to eat around 1400 a day according to what I've seen.  I plan on contacting my doctor tomorrow about this to get the full scoop but, am I really doing the wrong thing here?  I'm only 4 foot 11 and born female, so I don't take much food to fuel to begin with, so I always just assumed this all made sense."
"Rant: No Progress, Just Getting Worse Hi I’m F (26), 5’2”, 160 lbs. At the start of the pandemic, I was on a weightloss journey  at 152 lbs. Things have gotten so much worse in the past year. I’m trying everything to get back on track and i feel like everything I do makes me gain.

CICO? I gain weight.

Noom? Gained weight

Trying to expand my running/work outs? Gaining weight.

I’m really proud of everyone on here who seems able to lose it, but I feel like I’m getting gaslit by my own body. It seems the harder I try, the more I gain. And I can’t figure out why the heck it’s happening.

Anyone else out there going through this? I could really use some solidarity and understanding. Also, if this sounds familiar to you and you have any advice, I’m all for it."
"Losing weight fast might be costing you more time in the long run… I get it. You hop on the scale and the number is higher than you want it to be. You want to fix it, and you want to fix it fast. Let me tell you, I tried that, and it was *not* worth it. 

I dropped 48 pounds a few years ago in an extremely short period of time and am *still* dealing with the negative consequences, none of which were worth the time I “saved” by dieting quickly.

I am a 5’7” active female who didn’t do the proper research before deciding to lose weight. I saw the number on the scale, freaked out, and went to work on the problem. I picked the “magic” 1200-calorie budget I thought was standard for all females (hint, hint: it’s actually *not* standard for most females) and ramped up physical activity *a lot*. The weight flew off.

Unfortunately, and I did not know this at the time, I completely f\*cked up my hormones in the process of losing weigh in a quick manner. By the time I figured out how bad I had messed up, my body started freaking out. I lost my period (for 3+ years) but worse, I obtained Binge Eating Disorder as my body’s way of dealing with the trauma of quick weight loss.

So, now, not only have I gained the weight back, I have been battling BED for years and my hormones are still messed up (my period showed up for the first time in three years in October and November 2020 but then disappeared again and hasn't been back since).

I did not save time by losing weight fast. Instead, I wasted years and messed myself up physically and mentally. 

Once my hormones re-regulate and I have a mentally and physically healthy relationship with food and exercise, I will lose weight and I will do it at the slowest rate possible while still making reasonable progress.

*If you want to save the most amount of time possible, do yourself a favor and lose weight right the first time. You won’t regret it.* 

What is the “right” way? It varies person to person, situation to situation. Do your research. Talk to professionals (real ones, not the Instagram ones). Figure out the best plan for *you*, which likely *isn’t* losing weight as rapidly as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I lost weight too fast, my body freaked out, and I'm dealing with a shit load of problems (including weight regain) years later. Losing weight rapidly usually doesn't lead to long-term success. Do your research. Talk to a professional. Lose weight in a safe way for *you*."
"3 week weight loss plateau Hey I'm a 26 year old male and weigh 101kg (16 stone). Last September I weighed 114kg (18 stone) and managed to lose the weight over 5 or so months by calorie counting, jogging a bit and some weight training but nothing major by any means. 

Anyway, about 2 months ago a tried the keto diet for a month and lost a couple pounds in the first couple weeks then plateuad at my current weight, I wasn't excercising because I had little energy on keto. Now for the past 3 weeks I've been calorie counting, doing 30 minutes HIIT every other day and doing some weight training on other days and I've lost NO weight. None at all. 

This is the most activity I've done since I was a kid and I am hitting my calorie goal every day without even counting the calories burned through excercises. 

Its really starting to get to me and I feel like all of this effort is for nothing. Has anyone else experienced this? I know plateau is normal but for 3 weeks after doing high intensity excercise?

Any advice? 

Thank you!"
"Finally making a change Hey y’all, I’m (22F, 5’3”,187 lbs) deciding that I really need to make a change now. I truly feel like a prisoner in this body. I have a long history of battling an eating disorder that started in middle school and then got better around my senior year of high school. But in early 2019, I went back into the cycle and it’s been an up and down journey for me. I’m probably the heaviest I’ve ever been and looking in the mirror is one of the worst things for me. I’ve never been a thin person by any means and I, unfortunately, have 40DD chest size. I’m hoping to lose enough weight where I can look and feel good in my skin and hopefully work on getting a breast reduction surgery in the process. 

My biggest struggle has always been diet. Exercise has always been something I’ve been able to be more consistent with but I’ve rarely seen results due to poor dietary habits. Diabetes runs in my family and I’m getting more anxious about possibly getting it, so I know my eating needs to change ASAP. 

I’m mainly posting here for the support. I know the steps I need to take to get to where I want, I’m just afraid of being inconsistent and failing. Ultimately, I hope I can kick my eating disorder permanently, lose the weight, and be the best version of myself I can possibly be."
"How do I accept my body type? I am short and fairly overweight, nearly obese. I'm grateful that my biggest insecurity isn't tied to being fat, although it is making it difficult to maintain the motivation to lose weight.

I have a short thick torso &amp; my limbs also appear somewhat short for my height. A few years ago I managed to lose a noticeable amount of weight and I would appear oddly lanky and stumpy at the same time. My stomach did not change much at all and my body remained kind of squarish. I became really frustrated and ended up gaining all the weight back.

I have always wanted a long torso and long legs. Often I assess myself in the mirror to see if I have the potential to look the way I want to at my goal weight, even if logically it isn't possible. Whenever I see myself for the way I am, I turn to food and begin to mope. I've been stuck like this for so long and have been growing increasingly more vain each day. There are reasons to lose weight outside of looking good, but I can't seem to move past this point. I've never truly accepted that I don't have my ideal body covered in fat.

This is not to say that you can't be beautiful without those proportions and I understand people are different, but I have yet to come across someone with my body type. This problem is stupid and I'd like to learn how to get over myself. How do I learn to accept what I can't change and start making progress?"
"TDEE advice Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Before I track my calories to lose weight I want to see what some of you have to say because most of you are super helpful. I measured my TDEE with a calculator. I am 5'8 185 pounds currently and I don't know my body fat but I would assume it is between 15-20% so I put 20% (I do have a lot of stomach fat). So pretend that was my body fat and pretend I run everyday (I try to run everyday and am pretty good at that - also according to my apple watch I burn 320 cals on each run so pretend that is right too). It calculated my TDEE to be 2900 cals which I honestly don't believe and my basal metabolic rate was 1700 calories. I am looking to lose 15-20 pounds. Do you think if I eat at 1700 calories and run everyday I will be in good shape to lose that 15-20 pounds? Let me know! Stay safe."
"Desperate need of advice on meal plan Trying to lose weight. I’m a 22 female, 5’6 and at 226 lbs.

I’ve so far lost 10 lbs. I’m wondering if I should change my meal plan tho. Something about it feels wrong.

My current meal plan is 

Breakfast: 

• 1/2 sugar free oatmeal
• 1/2 milk 2% 
• 1 tablespoon peanut butter
• 1 banana 

Lunch:

• 2 slices of whole-wheat bread
• 1 small can of starkist Tuna 
• 1 tablespoon light mayo
• 1 Amy’s 14 oz no chicken noodle soup
• 2 tablespoons of country rock plan butter 

Dinner: 

• 1 Chicken breast
• Stir fry veggies (usually 1/2 cup)
• Sauce (usually from like a stir fry packet)
• 1/4 to 1/2 jasmine rice

Any advice on weight loss would be greatly appreciated. I’m trying to hit 190 lbs by June 12. Preferably 185 lb by then. 

I’m very limited on what and when I can cook.

Should I switch my lunches to match my dinners or? 

I just feel very lost. I don’t mind meal prepping it’s what I do for my dinner."
"M/21/6'1"" [262-198=64 LBS] My current before and after pics [Front view](https://imgur.com/a/MhNQG3y)

[Side View](https://imgur.com/a/lEovwHl)

I've struggled with weight my whole life, as I'm sure have many of us here. Sometimes I have trouble just seeing how much I've lost, sometimes I feel like my scale is just lying to me about it. I don't really have anywhere else to post this since I'm still not comfortable enough with my body to post it on other social media. I know I still have a long way to go but I figured I'd post here anyway just to celebrate getting below 200lbs for probably the first time since high school.

The heaviest I weighed myself was 262lbs, 34% bodyfat on Oct 19th 2019. Since then I realized I needed to change something, I wasn't happy with who I was and it affected how I viewed myself everyday, it still does sometimes. I started with Keto to lose the first 20lbs and from there I got a gym membership and started going with a good friend of mine. Once I started at the gym I lost interest in Keto and just stuck to maintaining a caloric deficit. I used a calculator to figure out my macros and stuck to around 1800 calories a day, focusing mostly on my protein intake, my goal was to lose 2lbs a week. I went to the gym 5 days a week for a couple months until they had to close in my province.

 I'm not sitting at 198Lbs around 18% bodyfat, which means I'm still in the overweight category. My goal weight isn't really set in stone, I just want to get to somewhere I'm happy with, for now my goal is 190lbs, then it'll be 180lbs, and so on."
"Samsung Health recommended calorie intake I just put my stats into Samsung Health and it's recommending I eat 1258 calories a day. Is that supposed to be to maintain?! Or to lose some unspecified amount of weight?

I've been eating approx 1200 and have lost 8lbs in about 8 weeks, so my tdee must be closer to 1700, right? (Possibly a bit lower if the first few pounds were water weight.)

Samsung Health is tracking my steps but doesn't seem to take them into account as it recommends I eat 1258 whether I do 1,000 or 10,000.

My stats are 161cm, 115lbs. I've only got the last stubborn 5lbs to go and then I want to maintain... but at more than 1258 measly calories! That's gotta be wrong, hasn't it?"
"How do I work out when my back hurts from being out of shape? I'm kind of embarrassed to make this post.. But through COVID-19, having kids, and just generally getting into lazy habits, means that I have gained so much weight that I am having physiological issues.

My back is hurt now. Whenever I stand for more than 10 minutes, or walk longer than 5 minutes, my lower back and shoulders start hurting. I want to get an agile body back but now my back actually physically hurts when I am walking.

Has anyone ever experienced this? Should I just keep walking through it?

I just walked one block and my muscles were hurting, my back hurts, and my stamina is shot. If I keep going will this get better?

I just don't even know what to do anymore.... I just want to be healthy :("
"Help losing weight please! (: Hiya everyone on this subreddit! 

I’d like some help losing weight, I’ve been slim/average sized my whole life but recently over a lockdown, I’ve put on some weight around my stomach and especially my thighs; because I wasn’t being active, it also didn’t help that all motivation was lost due to mental health issues that I suffer with.

I’ve been doing some home workouts and eating healthy but usually my education gets in the way. If there are any meal plans that I could use for weight loss that are free, please link it down below because that would be beyond helpful. 

I used to have a 25/26 inch waist, hip size was 39 inches, now I’m 28/29 inches around the waist and 41 on my hips which is only slight increase but I’m not happy with it. I also went up two cup sizes, from a 23DD to 32/34E which I’m not exactly complaining about!

I’m currently walking around 10000 steps a day, to &amp; from my place of education, I want to start going on runs early in the morning but I can now only go on weekends, I’m not sure how beneficial runs would be but I can’t do as much as I’d want to because gyms aren’t open! 
If anyone could please link some home workouts down below, that would also be incredibly helpful. I’ve been using Chloe Ting’s home workouts but they don’t seem to be working very well! 

Thank you to anyone who interacts with this post 🤍"
"Today I crossed over the line into ""Normal"" from ""Overweight"" on the Wii Fit! [https://i.imgur.com/hAn2FM4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/hAn2FM4.jpg)

I know BMIs aren't the most reliable tool for health and weight, but in all my years as a Wii Fit owner I have always been categorized as overweight. Today I heard the ""Normal"" jingle for the first time!

Some background; I'm male, 24-years-old, and I reached my heaviest weight last Christmas at 96kg / 211lbs. The first week of January, I started intermittently fasting and exercising using the Wii Fit. I'm a sucker for nostalgia, and the Wii was my first game console, so the Miis, menus and music bring me a lot of joy (even if exercising is a drag). I'm also an introvert, so exercising from the privacy of home is a plus. Today, I weigh 82.5kg / 182lbs. 

For anyone thinking about purchasing or dusting off a Wii Fit, I totally recommend for it. I believe that most of my weight loss is because of the changes to my eating habits, but the Wii Fit has been a great tool for accountability. The balance games and dance routines mixed in with cardio and strength training are also surprisingly fun and sort of make you forget that you're working out. 

I've still got a ways to go, but little milestones like this are great motivators to keep on keeping on."
"Holy Crap, I'm at my goal weight! Hello losers! After my first day of logging calories into myfitnesspal on 3/25/20, I am pleased to report that I have reached the goal my doctor has given me since I started seeing her 4 years ago, I'm at 175, a BMI of 26.6, and while not in the ""normal"" range, my doctor told me that it's a fine weight for men of my height and will be healthy for me. I definitely still have another 10-20 lbs left in the tank, and my goal now is to maintain between 155-175 going forward and get down another 10 lbs, holding muscle mass constant of course over the next 6-12 months. My original goal was to be under 230 by this time, starting on March 25th at 318, and weighing in in Feb 2020 at 333 and half trying for a couple months, I built in some setbacks into my timeline. But I had ZERO SETBACKS! I just gritted my teeth and plowed through the early phases of weight loss, when the work you put in pays off marginally for a long time, and man oh man was it worth it!!

Once I got below 250, every 5 lbs lost was noticeable. I bought 2xl's in June of 2020 when I was in the 270s and 260s, they fit me for 90 days, they were night shirts for 90 more days, and now they're just WAY too big. My waist size was 50 when I was in the 300s, it was only 48 at 250, but is 34 now at 175. The work you put in pays off, but not immediately, and that's what I've found is key to this, you just have to grit your teeth and put in the work in the first third of your journey through long weight loss. Like literally everyone else who's had success, I have no stories about a magic pill, or getting results by not putting in work. But I will offer some wisdom:

Dieting should be a challenge, but it should not be miserable. Do not restrict yourself. IF, Keto, and other diets work great for some people, and for others they fail miserably. I was in this category and recognized that previous attempts weren't working, they made me miserable, and I went back to old habits before I lost my 50th pound.  Calorie counting was challenging, but I kept myself to a range. 1200-2000 at first, averaging 1600. Then I ticked it up to 1500-2500, averaging 1750. Then as I got closer to goal, I ticked it to 1750-2500, averaging 1900, which is where I currently am, and don't plan to change anytime soon. The average may tick up as I get close to/into the normal range, or decide to build more muscle, but it's all dependent on my TDEE and my fitbit keeping me in check with calories burned estimates.

Here's before and after (ish). I was around 200 in the after pic, taken around Christmas time if you couldn't tell by the decor. The before pic was February 2020, and I'm pictured right (obviously) in that one:[https://imgur.com/a/g9SIHa3](https://imgur.com/a/g9SIHa3)

To illustrate my point above regarding the slow results initially, I was wearing a large polo in the after ish picture, 25 lbs ago that is now a little too big for me. I am comfortably a men's medium now. The difference between 2xl and 3xl otoh or 1xl and 2xl, was 40-50 lbs each. The extrinsic results will come, keep grinding through what some have called ""The Valley of Disappointment"", the results are stored for later, they will come eventually.  Keep at it, don't restrict yourself, find a diet and excercise routine that works for you and that will be sustainable long term. The lifestyle is longterm, but the calories you can eat WILL increase as you approach your goals and shift to maintenance. Go out there and crush it!!!"
"Change what you consider ""default"" Want to change your eating habits permanently? Change the foods that you consider to be ""normal.""

We all know (or you will know soon if you're in this sub) that you have to consume less calories than you expend to lose weight, AND that you have to maintain better eating habits after you lose weight in order to keep from regaining it back. But how?  You have to change what you think is normal so that you can stop thinking about food all the time.

This isn't a post about intuitive eating (IE), but I will say that the *idea* of IE is the holy grail of food-related behavioral change.  I want to be able to eat what I want, when I want, but I need ""what I want when I want"" to just so happen to coincide with how I want my body to look.

We live in an obesogenic environment, and a big factor of that is based on what we perceive to be the 'normal' caloric profile of the foods available to us.

For example, there's no reason that 'regular' Jif/Skippy peanut butter has to be your normal when you think about peanut butter.  Do you know PBFit? 70 calories vs 190 calories for the same volume. If you went to the grocery store and saw ""Double Stuffed Extra Sweet Peanut Butter"" would you ever buy it as more than a novelty? Probably not.  Well, that is what 'regular' PB is compared to PBFit.

The same thing with jelly.  The regular jelly has *sugar added*. (because grapes aren't sweet enough apparently).

Same thing with ice cream, beer, popcorn, soda, cheese, yogurt, salad dressing, bbq sauce, syrup.  There are amazing choices in all of these categories that make the normal versions look like literal candy and fat bombs.  Nobody wants candy all the time but that's what we eat.  On top of that, veggies are freakin' amazing.  Sooo many veggies out there and you actually don't have to slop them in oil for them to be good either.

Stop thinking of low-calorie-density foods as ""lite alternatives"" to regular foods and start thinking of them as the default.  Start thinking about the 'normal stuff' as extra-sweet, added-fats, etc. *because they are and it's because they want you to buy it.*  But those are treats, those aren't your daily use stuff.

Start searching for delicious, low-calorie-density foods and recipes that fill you up and make those your 'defaults.'  You will lower your average overall calorie intake with long-term sustainable habits.

Anyway, that was kind of a nonsensical rant by the end, but I hope you enjoy it."
"[20M 5'11'' SW: 343 CW: 260 GW: 205] Eating in a calorie deficit but no weight change. I started my weight loss journey about 3.5 years ago and lost 100 lbs initially. But I took a year off from dieting and gained about 30 lbs back. I started dieting again this last new years. And I've been eating 2200-2400 calories on most days, and even only 2000 calories on one or two days a week usually. But, I've been stuck at 260 for about a month now and it's seriously demotivating me. My weight throughout the week is just like 259, 260, 259, 261, 259, 260, 262. Just up and down every day. My macros (C/F/P) is 40/30/30 everyday. I'm working out 5-6 days a week with 1.5-2.5 hours of raised heart rate every workout. According to all calculators and everything I've read online, my TDEE is like 3200-3600 calories and I'm not eating near that. I'm so confused as to what I'm doing wrong."
"Changing everything, how do I start? I'm 31, biologically female and went from vegetarian to pescetarian last week.

I suffer from severe anxiety and apparently depression (though not as severe) and my heart rate had become unbearable. Got meds for it. I'm at risk when it comes to high blood pressure (genetics). I'm scared of dying so I have to change everything about the way I live.

I used to weight 55kg (am 160cm tall) but I put on a lot of weight in the past 7 years and I'm now 68kg (I've lost 2kg... That's the beginning of something). I don't walk much, don't work out, my health is basically what you'd expect of someone who is very obese because my lifestyle is so unhealthy. With covid, it got worse as I basically didn't get out for 10 months.

I've heard it can be hard to lose weight on my meds but I want to do it. I want to be more active as well though my doctor says to start slowly. 

I think I can do it, I have to fight my poor mental health though. I know both my mental and physical health can improve. 

But I'm not quite sure how to do it with a pescetarian diet or even what kind of exercise I should do. Any suggestions?"
"12.7kg down so far. From 152.3 to 139.6 since mid January I just wanted to share my recent weight loss that has brought a smile to my face.

Back in January, after a saga of my grandmother being in hospital and subsequently passing away, I stress ate to the high heavens undoing all the weightloss I achieved prior to Christmas. I got back to University and weighed myself and found I was 152.3kg. I was horrified and extremely upset by that. I knew I'd put some weight back on, because clothes were tighter and my knee pain had gotten a little worse, but not to that effect.

I decided then I was going to stop stress eating all together. I cut out all the fizzy drinks and sugary nonsense I was throwing into my mouth on a daily basis and decided that I was gonna change myself. I started eating lower carb, in the hopes of stabilising my blood sugar but with placement for my nursing course starting, I found I just lacked the energy to do my job properly. I decided I would eat my standard diet 3 days a week while I was at the hospital, as those are my most active days without a doubt, and keep the low carb on my days off, where I am much less active due to the Covid lockdown in place right now.

I have to say, I think this has been the approach I have needed and weighed myself today to discover that I had weighed in at 139.6kg. I've also been working out religiously and my body has been eating that up. When I was in highschool, I was an active kid. No athlete mind you, I've always was the big kid, but I did my fair share of sport. I played rugby, did judo, mountain biking, hiking and many more. Sadly, due to injuries (some from said sports, some from an RTA), I can't workout with that intensity. Luckily I'd been working with low intensity programs with kettlebells and discovered a dude called Mark Wildman on YouTube. Having used his programming, I am finding it is meshing well with my lifestyle and I hope to keep it applied as long as I possibly can. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share my victory and ramble a bit about how I got here. My goal is to get to 95-100kg as that's what my body sat nice at when I was younger and very active, although that could change if I feel like it needs. 

Thanks for listening :)"
"Can someone explain the process of losing weight for me? Hi all! Basically I gained 20 pounds during the quarantine. I just really wasn’t taking care of myself. I really want to get back to my original weight 100-105 pounds. I’m 5 feet tall. 24 years old. 

For the past week, I have eaten the following:
-one gallon of water throughout the day
-1/3 cup oats mixed with a 1/4 cup blueberries
-a medium sized apple
-one cup chickpeas and 1/2 cup of couscous with some type of veggie mixed in
-organ protein powder (one to two scoops) one tablespoon of peanut butter and a tablespoon of flax seeds
-one slice of Ezekiel bread with 64grams of tempeh and a bit of sugar free ketchup 
-a Boca protein pattie with veggies and a 6 oz potato.
-according to my fitness pal: 1300 calories / 80 grams protein / 198 grams carbs / 30 grams of fat.

For exercise, I’m doing a half hour of cardio 5 days a week, lifting 5 days a week. Resting twice a week. According to my watch, I burn between 500-700 calories during my workouts.

It’s been a week and I am exactly the same weight. In fact, the the mirror I look bigger. I know it’s only been a week and I shouldn’t expect much. But I’m so concerned and nervous I am doing something wrong. I hired a trainer and she said I should be losing 1.5 pounds a week and so far that’s not happening.

For reference, I ate really bad since the pandemic started and stopped working out. I barely drank water. I went to the bathroom regularly and I noticed now, I am having a bit trouble going (TMI, I’m sorry!).

I have not diverted from the diet once, I give it my all during every workout. I haven’t been on a weight loss journey before so can anyone give input one why my weight is the same and I appear bigger in front of the mirror. I’m new to all this, please, please be gentle on me 😬. Thank you in advance!!!!


EDIT: Thank you everyone you have all put my mind at ease I cannot believe how thoughtful each response was and I cannot thank you enough for a supportive and amazing community. I really am taken back by how amazing you all are thank you to each and every single one of you who sent a comment in and calmed my nerves and taught me valuable information tools and resources!"
"Need guidance to cut down body mass/lose weight I'm 5'9"", currently at 204 pounds.   
I started gym 2 months ago after a 11 month hiatus due to the pandemic and school and haven't lost much weight since then. 

I currently follow a alternate day cardio / weight training schedule which equals to about 5-6 days a week at the gym and would want to know if this is the correct way to go about losing my weight? Should I also incorporate a more stricter diet with this?

I used to be 160 pounds before the pandemic started and I really want to get back to it but I'm really confused as to how I go about it since this is the heaviest I've been and I dont see much progress during these 2 months at the gym except some muscle gain."
"Overcoming Mental/Emotional Barriers Whilst Exercising Hi all,

I've looked online but none of the article are quite hitting the spot. I wanted to ask any of you who hear negative voices whilst exercising, how you overcome them?

Exercise has been a great place for me to challenge my limiting beliefs, but sometimes I will hear a really negative thought like 'I don't deserve to do well' and the thought will cause me to physically slow myself down after hearing it, because I don't think I deserve to run at faster speed and push myself, even though that's what I was doing prior to that thought.

Wanted to know how others might deal with the negative Nancy that lives in their head and how to get rid."
"I decided to not weight myself anymore Today I decided exactly this. I will not be weighting myself anymore and will try to rely on before and after photos and measurements. 

Since the beginning of January, I have been eating in a caloric deficit (without cutting anything that I love including bread and chocolate) and in mid February, I started exercising 3-4 times a week, mainly, walking for 5 - 7 km and playing 20 - 30 minutes of my ringfit. I started this journey with 70Kgs (154.32 pounds) and by the end of February, I reached 67 (147.71 pounds). 

Everything seem to be going great right? Today I decided to weigh myself once again, and found that I was again, near the 70Kgs mark and I thought the world was ending, I sobbed so hard and tried to understand what did I do wrong - I basically spent the whole morning feeling like crap and wanting to give up. 

I realize now, thanks to the help of my amazing fiancé, that I shouldn’t be taking this as a sign of defeat - weight fluctuates for many reasons and the truth is, I’ve been feeling amazing lately: my mood is amazing, I have lots of energy, my hair and nails have never been healthier and I feel my clothes are fitting me way better, some even loosely. 

Apologies for my english, not my first language but if you’re having a hard time with your own journey- I hope this helps :)"
"Stuck in a rut, going to adopt my mindframe from when I started losing weight 85lbs ago Last year I lost 100lbs, then over the holidays and some ""life issues"" that I won't go into here, I gained 14 or so back. and BOY OH BOY has that been detrimental to my mental health. For the last 2 months I've been back into weight loss. Eating healthy. CICO. Exercise. But I seem to be losing and gaining back the same 5lbs and it is *killing* my motivation.

When I started off, BMI 41, depressed, unable to go outside without several layers of giant clothing, and shoving chips into my mouth, I didn't know where to begin. So I essentially gave myself a live-or-die month of doing everything ""right"" with no snacks, walking everywhere, just **do it even if you don't want to.** And it worked. And that month of hard work set me up with enough drive and determination to get to a healthy weight.

But.. here I am. Healthy weight, 35lbs to go, and no progress in the last 2 months. So I 'm going back to basics. I'm going to pretend I know nothing and restart. Pretend I don't know what I'm doing and get to my goal. I've never really gained weight before. I was always fat, then I lost 100lbs. But now that I have gained and can't seem to get back into losing... it is making me feel like a complete mess. 

I am starting to see temptation/cravings (ie, eat a whole pizza and lay on the couch for 3 hours with my partner) as a **challenge** instead of an excuse to give up/give in. I'm using them as a push forward instead of a reason to sit still. I am really using the last of my motivation here to throw myself into this next month. Wish me luck. Have a great day everyone"
"I know there's no slow or fast metabolism but I feel like my metabolism is actually slow. I lost about 30Kg since 2019 and I got to a good weight (60Kg 5'6"" Male). I counted calories (about 1300-1500 per day) and macros and did cardio + lifting. After reaching 60 I wasn't really counting calories but I was able to maintain for a while. 

But I've gotten really busy since November and I got absolutely no time to exercise since I work from 8AM to 11PM every day and I also pull all-nighters like 4 days a week. I gained back to 65 in that time so I started cutting back calories. Now I'm able to maintain at 60 but I still wasn't counting. So I counted my calories yesterday to make sure my macros are right.

Turns out I'm only eating 700-900 every day. And I've been eating the same since the start of February. And I was eating even lesser than that until February to cut down from 65. How am I able to maintain with only 700-900 calories when even my bmr is way above that. 

Should I maybe go to the doctor to get a blood report done to make sure everything's right?"
"Big plateau, still following CICO Hey everyone! I’ve been following this subreddit for awhile but I’ve never made a post. I’m really struggling with a weight loss plateau and I need help.

Background:

I’ve been on a weight loss journey since about august when I was at my heaviest of 211lbs. I’ve since gotten down to 195lbs but I haven’t been able to drop past that. I’ve been doing CICO Since august and I have been tracking all my calories and I work out 7 days a week (combo of HIIT and strength training) but my weight stopped dropping in February and hasn’t moved much since. 

At first I was eating 1300-1400 and then I bumped it up to 1600-1700 to match up with my training intensity and so I don’t feel drained while working out. Should I drop my calories back down? 

I’m a 21 year old female and my height is 5’9

I’ve seen visual changes and I’ve continued to drop inches but I’m stressed as to why the scale isn’t moving like it was in the beginning, my goal weight is 155-165. 

I’d appreciate any advice on weightloss plateaus and what to do to break them"
"I fell off the original plan I had cast and don't know how to get back into it So I decided to lose weight and started out by counting my calories and tried to get some exercise into my very busy school schedule. But for the last two weeks I have been having a insane amount of stress from school, from exams and practical exams. I tried my best to follow my healthy eating but during my all nighters I just gave up and snacked on unhealthy things like mini snickers and sugar free crackers and like that I gained some weight. Now my exams are over for now with my finals starting in less than two weeks. I also messed up in my exam big time because of not sleeping the nigh before and  am right now in a deep self hate session because I have never scored this low in my life before. I really have no idea how to get back into my original plan. Also how do I keep this up during my exams and not emotionally eat myself to satiate that void. Any advice would help."
"Is it ok to undereat on weekdays? 5’4”, currently at 168 lbs. Fitbit puts me at 3000 calories burned per day on average (tends to ping pong between 2800 to 3500 per day), though naturally take that with a grain of salt.

Trying to lose weight and using a food scale to help. One important qualifier is that I’m on a medication with the known side effect of appetite loss.

Since using a food scale and cooking my own food instead of relying on takeout, I’ve noticed that I average about 1000 calories per day. This is pretty much all vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, etc. I’m not huge on grains, which seem to trigger my IBS at random. I don’t eat dairy or eggs, and eat meat very rarely. I would really like to be at 1500-1800 calories, which seems much safer.

Weekends, I put the food scale away and eat takeout. I still try to choose vegetable heavy, nutrient dense options, but beyond that I don’t fuss. I would estimate I eat about 3000-5000 calories over the course of the weekend.

My doctor is not exactly enthused about this eating schedule, but has also said nutrition is really not his speciality and that in the case of my medication, it’s far more important to eat small meals throughout the day, and that the amount of calories is less relevant.

My question is, am I screwing up my metabolism or body by doing this? I am genuinely not hungry at the end of the day and, while I can make myself eat more, sometimes I can’t keep it down.

Sample Weekday:

Breakfast: coffee, green smoothie w chia seeds and soy milk

Lunch: 3 pieces of fruit, which unfortunately can take me over an hour to consume

Dinner: pasta w lentil tomato sauce OR some sort of bean-based soup w bread"
"9 months This is how I see it..it took me 9 months to have a baby, during that time I had to eat/drink what I was supposed to, to have a healthy baby. Now, it will take nine months to lose weight and in order lose this fat (not pregnancy fat, that was 40 years ago), but anyway 9 months of eating/drinking what I am supposed to to lose the fat tummy. When you are pregnant there is nothing you can do to rush it, you have to weigh in every so often, me now every day and monitor ourselves and see the fat leave but there is no rushing to get rid of baby and no rushing to get rid of this fat. Just planning and Instead of baby clothes we can buy ourselves fresh new clothes or outfit. Some it may be as long as 2-3 pregnancies but if we cared about the baby which we did, we should care about ourselves and see it through."
"Update: Almost 10 pounds down! Hey all!

I'm F18 5'3(160cm) SW:177(80kg) CW:169 lb(77kg) GW: 125 lb(57kg) and I am super excited to say this because in the past 2 months, I've dropped almost 10 pounds. I think that's really cool, and I'm super excited to keep going on this weight loss journey. I'm really, really glad to be out of the 170s because that was stressing me out big time, but I'm even more glad that I'm able to get into the 150s in a couple of months.

Here's what I did: (to fill the word count)

I eat 1350 calories a day and don't cut any foods out of my meals. I eat plenty of sweets and carbs, but I probably should raise my protein because that's low. I don't really exercise except for a walk once a week, but I'm planning on exercising more when my weight is lower so that I don't look skinny-fat and tone up. I'm also planning on cutting down to 1200 calories when I hit 155 pounds by cutting out my 150 calorie breakfast and eating everything else the same way.

I always feel like I'm not going to lose weight when I'm full, but I'm happy to note that even on my calorie budget, I get plenty full, and I'm still losing weight.

Best of luck to everyone!"
"Wecipe Wednesday - March 10, 2021 - Squash! Welcome back to Wecipe Wednesday. I volunteered to lead a return of this longstanding regular thread at [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) at least until the end of March 2021.

I have selected 13 meals or dishes that I keep making over and over that should be compatible with most diets. I'll include the ingredients list, nutritional information along with other hints. Some recipes are vegetarian/vegan, others not so much.

Post your favourite healthy recipes here to share with the rest of the loseit community! Recipes don't have to fit this week's theme at all, they should just be something that you can eat reasonably frequently while actively losing weight.

Due to the spirit of the sub, please try to include the calorie and nutritional information if at all possible. MyFitnessPal has awesome recipe calculators you can use!

For the most part, I target my meals to have a component in the 350-550 kcal range. My lunch and dinner tend to be right around 400 kcal each and dinner can be a bit heavier, or include a side dish to bring the calories up a bit. When I was eating 1650 kcal/day the breakdown was roughly 400/400/600/250 for breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks.

Anyhow: enough background on to the recipes!

**Squash**

A few weeks ago I posted my Spaghetti Squash Casserole recipe, and I've also done soups, and I've talked about roasts and squashes can be really nice roasted. I usually have one dish of the week during the colder months that includes squash, butternut, acorn, spaghetti, pumpkin, as a star or just in a major supporting role.

With the aid of my trusty Instant Pot, I can cook a whole butternut squash in less than 30 minutes. Acorn squash too. These preparations tend to be pretty easy. Place the squash (halved and seeded or not) on a trivet with 1 cup of water in the pressure cooker and set the pressure cooker for 8-12 minutes. with 10 minutes to pressurize and depressurize you get yummy squash in a fraction or the time or work to cook it. I like squash lightly seasoned with salt as a side. Add a bit of butter, maple syrup and pie spices and have it as dessert. You can cook it a bit longer so that it can easily be pureed and turned into a hearty soup, etc... etc...

However that's not the recipe I want to focus on today.

Today's recipe is for when you do have squash on hand plenty of time to cook and want something seriously fulfilling that will stick to your ribs and satisfy the soul. 

https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/butternut-squash-risotto-crispy-pancetta

Risotto seems like it violates everything there is to be said for ""diet food"" it's white rice, with butter and cheese and in this case some crispy pancetta (can substitute prosciuto or bacon or omit entirely) but in the right portion it can easily fit most calorie budgets and be a great way to incorporate whatever ingredients you have that are currently in season or on hand.

- 2.5 cups arborio rice [1600 kcal]
- 1.5 pound butternut squash [625 kcal]
- 0.25 pound pancetta [345 kcal]
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter [400 kcal]
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil [350 kcal]
- 0.5 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving [200 kcal]
- 1 cup dry white wine [90 kcal]
- 5.5 cups chicken stock or low-sodium broth [80 kcal]
- 1 medium onion, finely diced [40 kcal]
- 8 sage leaves [0 kcal]
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper [0 kcal]

All together this recipe makes 8 servings, each clocking in at 470 kcal according to MFP [16/68/10 fat/carbs/protein] I usually cut the recipe in half and it just absolutely fills you up. The risotto keeps well in the fridge and makes a reapparance later in the week as either dinner another night or just have it for lunch (We'll often break it down the second half of the pot into three lunches at just over 300 kcal). I will often pair it with a quickly cooked baby spinach with garlic and lemon for a bit more greens. 

What are you cooking? Do you do anything interesting with squash?"
"Appetite Control and Wellbutrin. I hope I’m not breaking any rules by asking this. 24/F/233.4 Hi everyone;

I’m relatively new here and was curious if anyone has experience with sustained weight loss on Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin is an anti-depressant, and I’ve noticed that it helps suppress my appetite (not hunger) so I can make healthy choices in eating. Combined with actually eating healthy and moderate movement, I’ve lost almost 40 pounds since the new year and I’m proud of that. 

I do have a tiny worry that if I’m ever taken off Wellbutrin that the cravings will come back.  Admittedly though, there has been no discussion between my PCP and me about a timeline for getting off the medication. Does anyone have any experience with managing appetite when you’re taken off this medicine?"
"Help for MFP exercise calories Hi Everyone! 

Sorry if this isn't the correct place to post this but I'm looking for some help as I can't find it elsewhere. 157cm F currently at 128lb and looking to get down to 118lb and I've been eating 1200cal per day. I have an office job which is not active so since I've started this journey I've been walking (quick paced and largely up hill) 10,000+ steps a day (between 7km &amp; 8km) yet when I log into MFP after my exercise it says I've only burned 150 (sometimes less) calories during the walk??? 

I just feel like SURELY I would be burning more calories than this? and I also don't want to mess up my body but underfeeding it if MFP is incorrect. 

Can anyone shed some light? I'd be so appreciative! Thanks!!"
"M22 - I've lost weight but I still have gynecomastia/man-boobs. Help? Hi everyone. About since I hit early puberty, I've been overweight and had gynecomastia/man-boobs. I had gained a lot more weight up around the pandemic, but eventually started to go on a diet and lose it around August. I'm about 6'4-6'5 tall, and I used to weight 270 pounds, but now I'm down to 216, which is still overweight but still pretty good. I'd still like to lose a little more weight, but I feel much happier with myself and my body. Still, despite losing weight on a lot of areas on my body, I still have man-boobs. When I look up how to get rid of them, most websites just say ""lose weight"". I haven't really been working out as a part of my weight loss, just eating way better and losing weight because of that. Would getting onto a workout regiment that focuses on burning chest fat in addition to continuing to lose weight fix my problem, or do you think it might be best to see a doctor and see if I just need to get surgery?

tl;dr, I've lost 50 pounds since August and feel much better about my body image, but still have man-boobs which are really crushing my spirits. What can/should I do about it?"
"Feeling hopeless, I have been stuck in a plateau for 3.5 months SW: 205 lbs.

GW: 120 lbs.

I'm starting to feel hopeless, I've been stuck at 176.4 lbs for 3.5 months. I have tried everything, starting with eating what I want in a healthy way an not trying to cut calories. I ate about 1,900 calories a day and my weight only moved up two pounds and did not give my metabolism a jumpstart like I hoped for.

Recently I've been cutting calories again and moving a lot more. I've been eating only 1,373 calories a day, and today is my breaking point. I only ate 1,248 calories yesterday and burned 319 by walking and hula hooping, i wake up today so, so, sore, and my weight is still 176.4 calories.

I don't know what to do at this point, i know all that I don't gain back is a win in and of itself. However, I'm so tired of lugging all this weight around. I also stand for 5 hours straight at work, how am I not able to fix this? Does anyone have any idea what is wrong with me?"
"How to become a breakfast person? Hello! I’ve been progressively working out more and more over the past month. I’m starting to count macros too, but I think because I’ve never been a breakfast person (just not hungry at all in the mornings aside from a cup of coffee and a scoop of collagen) I’m having trouble hitting my protein macros.

"Recovering from adrenal fatigue, and weight watchers Hello all!

I’ve recovered a lot from adrenal fatigue, but I need to lose the weight that I gained during these last couple of years due to my love for pastries lol. I say that I recovered a lot, because I now work part time and can still have a bit of fun on my free time. I will try to lose weight through following a couple of cookbooks from Weight Watchers. I can’t pay for a 3 month plan or anything, so I’m thinking that if I only stay away from alcohol and sweets, and follow these cookbooks for lunch and dinner meals, I might be able to lose weight in a steady pace.

Does anyone who’s had adrenal fatigue tried to lose weight through Weight Watchers, and what was the result? This will be my first time trying out WW, and I’m figuring that it’s very nutrition dense yet containing few calories. 

Thanks!"
"F/27/5’1” [212-180=32 lbs] Mid-progress before and after pics [Pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/DyfsFfQ)

Hi everyone,

I’ve been trying to lose weight since the first week of December (worst time to start a diet by the way!) Been on my weight loss journey for exactly three months. 

For anyone interested in my diet, I did lazy keto for the month of December, got more disciplined in January with a few slip-ups here and there, then really became militant on February 1 when I incorporated intermittent fasting along with keto and strict calorie counting. What a game changer that is. Snacking at night is my kryptonite. 

As for nutrition, I try to stay between 1000-1100 calories per day (my doctor OK’d this because I was, and am still, clinically obese). I eat mainly whole foods - lots of meat (including red meat), eggs, whole dairy, and vegetables. Maybe once a month I’ll treat myself to McDonalds where I’ll indulge in a Big Mac with half a bun. Other than that, I cook all of my meals at home. 

Now onto exercise. For the first two months, I walked for 90 minutes 3x per week. Now I walk for an hour about once or twice per week. I think once I get closer to my goal weight, I’ll incorporate strength training to look more toned. 

My ultimate goal weight is 130lbs and I want to be there by the end of August. I can’t wait to see what my body will look like then. I’m hoping for an hourglass figure!

Anyways, I’ve had a really difficult time personally the last three months and seeing this actually work out for me brings me happiness because it’s one of the only things going well in my life."

"Help/question on losing weight Hello,

I decided on Feb 2nd that something needed to change and I wanted to lose weight. I stopped drinking soda and stopped eating fast food.

I am 5'5 and weigh 190 pounds.

&amp;#x200B;

when I started losing weight it went well i lost 10 pounds quickly just be stopping soda. from Feb 2nd to March 1st, I went from 190 to 178.4 pounds. What has been killing my motivation, since march 1st im hovering around 178-179 (let me see 177 once!!!) so I decided to add whey protein and a multivitamin, which I added on march 5th. Taking whey protein twice daily and light cardio 30-60 mins a day. but im still 178.4 pounds. should I not take whey protein? not sure what else to do

Edit: since people asked about calories

Going to add on, I am not really counting calories I changed the way i eat (prob not the smartest) but i went from drinking 32-60 oz of soda a day and eating fast food sometimes twice a day. and currently im eating the following (not counting calories)

breakfast - oatmeal / shake

snack - apple or yogurt

lunch - plain turkey sandwich with a slice of cheese / yogurt

snack

dinner - chicken breast / broccoli

I have been eating this way since feb 2nd and i stop eating at 7 PM

edit 2: felt a little down yesterday decided to have a cheat meal (pizza) weighed myself in the morning and i hit the elusive 177.8! i dont understand weight loss!"
"Jan 1st I stuggled to get out of the bath. Today I rowed The English Channel. I was 18st 11lbs at the start of the year.  Not sure why the bath tub was the thing that triggered me to start exercising but I distinctly recall being pissed off that I could not reach the taps and struggled to lift myself out of the tub.

I started indoor cycling and rowing, I have dropped 14lbs and today I rowed 35,000m for charity; the width of the English Channel.

I am still way too heavy but I proved to myself that I can put the hard work in and now I believe I can go all the way to target weight by the end of the Summer.

Set goals, work hard, support each other and you will get your rewards!

PS I am writing this in the bath tub after almost 3 hours on my rower.  I suspect it will still be a struggle to get out today 🤣"

"Confused about how many calories I’m burning! So, I’ve started my weight lose journey and have been counting calories for a few weeks now. I’m 5ft and 220lbs, 23 year old female. So i burn about 2009 calories daily.

I work in a store so I’m usually waking around all day and I’ve noticed on days that I work, and days I workout I need to eat more as I’m usually a lot more hungry, I still stay in my deficit but not at 500 like I do on days I’m not doing anything. 

I use MyFitnessPal to count calories and it counts my steps as well. Where I’m confused about is how many more calories I burn on days I work compared to days I don’t. On MFP it says I burn usually around 80 calories for my 8000 steps...  but on my Activity tracker it’s always a couple hundred higher. 

Which one should I trust? I really want to pay attention to what I’m burning in addition to what I’m eating so I can keep track of what my deficit actually is, I’m just a little confused and what I actually burn."
"People say I'm underweight and should gain weight.. but I disagree. Am I wrong? I'm a 22 year old male, 5'11, and currently 129lbs.

I've always been classified on the more underweight side, and people always question why I even diet because I'm nowhere near obese. I'm not sure if I'm just stubborn, or looking at things the wrong way, but I always reply why would I not diet?

What I believe to be the reason why I'm underweight is because genetically, I cannot put on much muscle at all, and my bones have always been very skinny even though I consumed plenty of calcium as a kid. Given this information, I'm naturally going to be lighter than the average human, since I have below average muscle and bone mass. Now don't get me wrong, I definitely can gain weight very, very easily. In fact, my appetite is one of the biggest out of everyone I know.

I don't see the purpose of gaining weight if the vast majority of it is just going to be fat. I've bulked before and wasn't happy with the results, and even have some photos to show below. It seems that many people I know think that me 20 pounds heavier would be considered more normal. Perhaps I would be more ""normal,"" but my brain tells me ""why be normal when you can be far leaner than the average human and be happier with the way you look"".

I don't think im anorexic, or even that close to it, but I would definitely like some opinions on this.  [Here](https://imgur.com/a/uKu3jdi) are photos of when I was \~127lbs, and some when I was \~151lbs, and to me, I prefer the way I look at 127lbs by a mile compared to the ones of when I was 151lbs. Am I anorexic? Should I really gain weight even though I'll just look fatter? Is my weight given my genetic predisposition to be underweight still unhealthy?"
"Help lose the belly fat I'm 40; 5.5' and weigh 130 lbs. I have been trying to lose some belly fat and haven't succeeded. I guess you can call me skinny fat. I have been doing IF 16-8 for 1.5 years. I have been cutting to 1500 calories, for close to 6 months now.

I then read an article that said I should then going back to maintain/refeed mode occasionally and upped my calories to 15x bw\~1900 calories, still with the same macros of 30/30/40 carb/fat/protein diet.  I do bodyweight workouts/light weights at home/cardio 3-4 times a week very religiously. Will go back to the gym, when they open.

Question for this group - what calories and macros should I be hitting? Someone recommended Keto, low carb diet. Also, should i be doing refeed/cutting cyclically? And when you refeed what macros should I use.

Thank you all."
"Up caloric intake just to bring it back down? Hey dudes,

7-8 months ago I started taking lifting and dieting/tracking seriously. I started out with little muscle mass at 162. After eating in a 20% surplus every day and even more the last month, after 6 months I was up to 207 with a lot of strength gains to go with it. A month and a half ago I then decided to start cutting to reveal the muscle I had hopefully put on. With my maintenance at around 3000 calories I went straight to 2300 from one day to the next, no gradual decrease. After eating and training at that caloric level, I lost 17 pounds in 3 weeks and was looking a lot leaner. However, the 2-3 weeks after that initial 3 has been extremely stagnant on the scale. I’m afraid that because I did not gradually reduce my intake, by body and metabolism adapted very quickly to the 2300 cal level and I have plateaued. Should I eat at maintenance and start over? Slowly up cardio? Let me know your thoughts, thanks guys!"
"I've gotten myself into a bad mindset. Early last year I started my serious  weight loss journey. I lost around 30kg from 110kg to 79kg at my lowest. Once I reached 79kg I felt that I already reached my goal so I started bingeing again and promptly gained 10kg in 5 months. I reached 90kg in the middle of January which set off an alarm in my head. I had an important event 3 weeks from that moment which required me to look nice in a suit. So I started going on my old meal plan which allowed me to lose weight. I lost around 5kg in those 3 weeks without feeling like I had to starve myself. After the event, I allowed myself to eat what I wanted again. And here I am now, 2 weeks after that event, and nearing 90kg again. When I realized that I could just quickly lose a lot of weight by controlling my calories (as evidenced by that 3 week diet) it made me think that I could just eat what I wanted now and go on a diet when I needed to look good again. So now I've gotten myself into this stupid mindset. I am aware that this is wrong and dumb but food is just too yummy. I currently have no event too look forward to so that makes it harder to fix my mindset. Does anyone have anything to say?"
"Question about sudden eight gain \*Sorry meant to say weight and not eight

Hi all. I just stepped on the scale and noticed a 7 pound weight increase from last week. I have been losing weight for just over a year, so I am no stranger to upticks in my weight. However, I have never had this sudden of an increase of decrease in one week before. I know I had some sweets in the beginning of the week, but I know that I didn't eat 10,000 calories worth. I wouldn't be surprised if I was up 2 pounds from eating them but not 7. I have started to run again after not doing it this winter. Is the combination of water retention and sweets enough to add 7 pounds or should I be concerned about this sudden increase?"
"Welp. I'm here. So \*deep breath\* here I am. I want to lose weight that I have great resentment about even having. I hate accountability, it makes me stressed out, but I think I'm at a point in my life where I want to push that limit of mine and actually say hi, I'm here, I want to lose weight, and I want to do it in a way that I can't weasel out of.

I struggle with I think three major issues? The first is anxiety over food. The second is that when I get hungry, I have low tolerance for that feeling of hunger and it turns into panic and then any food is acceptable because I'm just SO hungry (probably from avoiding food all day due to the first issue). And the third is that there are many times when I have excuses, lots of excuses. It's there, we need to eat it up, I'm too tired to make \_\_\_. Oh and maybe a fourth, which is that my work is more important than eating, so I skip meals while working because my only value (in my head, I mean I know it's not true but it feels true all the same) is in completing work. Oh, I thought of a fifth issue. The resentment towards my weight. I've had unhealthy relationships with food all my life, though until 27, I was mostly of a normal weight. My mother's been on a diet my entire life (I'm 37), I had anorexia between ages of 18 and 20, and then at 27 I got prescribed a medication that caused me not only to crave sugar but to be compelled to eat it, so I gained weight super fast. I'm off that medication now.

So here I am. I've lurked, and now I'm officially joining. This morning I finally opened a scale I ordered some weeks ago, and it turns out that in the last three months, I've actually lost over 20 lbs. I had no idea. I've been trying, bit by bit, to shift my eating. First by making it all gluten free (I have celiac), and then slowly by removing processed sugar and high carb low nutrient foods like mac n cheese. That's about as far as I've gotten. I keep an eye on calories but don't measure them diligently though that's my next step. I figured doing things one little bit by one little bit, I could shift them more permanently than by making sweeping stressful changes.

I would love some thoughts and advice if anyone has any to give. &lt;3"
"Vicious cycle of weight gain and binge eating - help? I’m stuck in a very bad cycle, and I don’t know how to get out.

I recently had a very bad relapse of binge eating behavior. Gained a lot of weight very quickly (about 10 lbs in 3 weeks). I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself for the behavior and how my body changed, but the only way I can figure to cope with those feelings, is with even more binge eating!! Which that obviously leads to even more weight gain, which makes me binge more, and so on and so on... 

Now I’ve gained a total of 24 lbs this year alone, putting me firmly overweight. I know this is destroying my health, and I’ve been living in exactly one pair of track pants and jumper for months because that’s all that fits me now.

How do I stop the cycle? Binging is the only way I know how to relive myself of the discomfort of noticing and feeling my weight gain, at least temporarily, but of course that’s also the very cause of the problem in the first place and only making it worse."
"I feel guilty when I eat protein cakes or pancakes... I've just started my caloric deficit journey and it's TOUGH. I'm used to just eating what i want but during the pandemic my walking went down to a near standstill, I wasn't lifting weights and the weight creeped up. I'm now doing calorie counting which is definitely the easiest way for me as it allows flexible eating! 

However I really struggle with hitting my protein. I don't want to eat boiled eggs or a can of tuna for a snack so I usually make protein pancakes or a mug cake if I need to up my protein - but I feel really...bad when I do? I keep thinking is this really healthy? Using a powder to up my protein - should I put all my efforts in trying to get natural forms of protein? Or is it really as simple as calories in/calories out and hitting macros - both should help me with my goal?"
"After looking at different weights and ranges on the BMI calculator I think it’s a bunch of bs! So I’m a 5’3” female and the BMI calculator says my normal weight is between 104lbs and 140lbs. That is a huge fucking window!! Wtf! If I ever got below 115lbs people would be freaking out and shoving sandwiches in my face. My thinnest adult weight was around 130lbs and everyone was saying I was too skinny then. I am so annoyed that I will still be in the over weight category at 145lbs, I mean my body is quite a bit healthier than it would be at 169lbs (the highest weight in the overweight category). I’m a small person so small changes in weight make a big difference!! I don’t understand why the chart is soooo huge in its categories. What is even the point then! I found it very discouraging. I still have another whole 20lbs to lose before I’m in “normal” category even though I feel soo sooo much healthier already. Oh well, I’m just frustrated 🙄"
"[Question] Taking anti-depressants and could use some weight loss tips. Hello everyone! 
Im M/25 and so far I’ve had no problem gaining or losing weight when I need too. I went from 210 in the 8th grade to 130 in the 9th grade. Slowly gained weight until junior year and gained about 30lbs (both fat and muscle) for powerlifting. Was about 230 in college, dropped down to 170 for the military, fast forward and I was about 210 for a couple years. This past year and a half though I’ve been on a multitude of medications for varying reasons and I’ve blown up in weight and can’t lose it. I’ve switched anti-depressants because of unwanted weight gain and finally I just don’t care. I kinda have to stick with this medication now and I’m at 246lbs. Mostly like anyone else all my weight is in my stomach area. I eat healthy, I exercise but I can’t lose the weight. I’ve tried different exercise plans, diets (at least for a month I’d follow these) but I can’t seem to lose the weight. Does anyone have any advice for me?"
"An Update to my post before Hi! F 21/H:164cm/W:264 pounds

TW/ talk of mental health and eating disorders  


I come back on slightly happier terms :) 

So I've started losing weight again, even if its only a pound it shows that what I'm doing is working, so I'm happy about that.

Also! You'll be glad to know I've started doing way more exercising, doing at least 15000 steps a day and I've also started doing the couch to 5k, which gets me out of the house and running (a little bit of exercise is better than none!)  
I'm eating around 1200 calories a day and tonight, after three weeks of hard work, I'm having a (calorie counted) homemade pizza night, so it feels nice to be able to treat myself!

  
Any advice anyone has would be greatly appreciated but I just wanted to let everyone know. This is the first time in my life after years of struggling with mental health and eating disorders where I actually feel confident that I'm making a positive change. 

I've bought new gym clothes, healthier food, and I'm getting out more! I just feel great, and even though I've got  LONG way to go, this will hopefully be a new start and a positive journey!"
"Struggling to get enough calories without going over my macro allotment. To begin, my boyfriend very lovingly( no sarcasm) that I should keep trying to lose weight. I am 30yo, currently at 182lbs, and I am about 5'4"" on a good day. I have previously found success on low-carb diets, but with me having an ED 15 years ago I worry that I may fall back into the awful habit of not eating enough.  I found my sweet spot on myfitnesspal, and I have the following breakdown:

1100 calories

41 grams carbs

43 grams fat

138 grams protein

for the last week, I have consistently been right on target(only a little under) with my carbs. fat, and protein but not getting close to my calorie goals, I have been at least 500 under each day. I eat 3 meals a day with an afternoon snack, and I walk a mile each day and run a mile every other day. 

1. is this calorie deficit safe for me to continue

2. Am I barking up the wrong tree even trying to count what I am counting.

"Can't stay motivated Hello. About 5 years ago I started WW and was very successful. I lost about 40 lbs. The. I lost my dad and everything stopped. I tried to get back into it a few months after he passed, but I had no interest in it. I gained everything and then some back. I have tried off and on to get back into it, but I always lose my focus and motivation. How do I get that motivation back.

"Middle of night snacking I’m not overweight. I’m currently going through a miscarriage And gained 10 lbs in the 10 weeks of pregnancy. But this issue isn’t just cuz of pregnancy. And I wasn’t counting calories while pregnant. Now I am. I need to lose this 10 in two months. I’m 5’2 and have been between 109-115 in the last 6 years. I’m currently 125 and nothing fits. However if I eat 1200 calories, which is damn hard but what I need to lose weight, I wake up middle of the night NEEDING sweets. And I never crave or like sweets. I’m not sleep walking but almost. Any advise or suggestions? I’m going to move all snacks into the other room where my mom sleeps so they’re harder to easily get middle of the night. Unfortunately I can’t remove it all from my house as my mom is currently staying with me. 
Suggestions? I need to stay healthy as I’m trying to conceive but I also have to lose this weight before another potential pregnancy and MORE weight."
"Fitness Pep Talk &amp; Motivation Hello all,

I'm a 31F who has been steadily losing weight (96.5kg down to 64.3kg) since October 2019. While I'm delighted with my weight loss, recently I've really been lacking with motivation to keep my fitness and workouts up.

Where I am, gyms are closed due to lockdown and won't be open for another monthst least.

I get a few walks in a week, due to walking to work and back, but I've been finding it very hard to motivate myself to go for runs and to do home workouts. 

Usually, when gyms are open (or when I had motivation to workout independently!) I used to do four sessions a week, doing strength training and cardio each session.

Does anyone have any motivating or helping words that may help push me in the right direction? 

Thanks!"
"Losing fat, does it require a calorie deficit? Apologies if this isnt the relevant sub as im looking to maintain weight, but thought the question about fat loss might best be answered here.


Im 5’9 and 74kg, i don’t have a high body fat percentage but would like to shed some body fat and gain muscle whilst maintaining my weight. To achieve this, does this require me undergoing a calorie deficit? Or can I just eat a lower level of fatty foods? The app I use to count calories suggests i take in 2716 calories (on a non exercise day) with 131g of protein, 339g of carbs and 91g of fat. Yesterday, I had 2664 calories, 230g of protein, 289g of carbs and 61g of fat. Is this a good approach diet wise to be taking to reach my goal? (If it matters i also exercise 4x a week) thanks in advance."
"Why do I feel like I need to compensate sugar that I used to intake but don't anymore? Basically, ever since I remember being myself I had an ice tea for breakfast and one during the afternoon, which ends up being a lot of sugar.

As time went on, maybe from 10 to 17 (last year) it was common for me to have a Coke (or any other fizzy drink) somewhere during the day, either lunch of mid afternoon, no matter if I still drank the 2 ice teas.

Last July I cut down on these drinks completely and only drink one or two cans a month, which I found to be a sustainable habit. The problem is that my body has always been accustomed to that much sugar so I spend the day craving it.

Normally I end up going to the supermarket, which is nearby (big problem), two or three times a week to buy sweets (skittles, mentos and all those haribo products, which I don't know the name in English) and end up eating them through the week.

I realise that this is a bad habit but I just can't stop it because I feel a very big urge to go and buy them, especially because nowadays I live with pretty healthy food habits, intermittent fasting, never liked cookies and chocolates.

What would you recommend I do in order to cut down on this unhealthy sugar intake?

I'm not big but have an above average fat %, I weigh 70kg and I'm 1.72cm tall (which would be about 155 pound and 5""7) and I was looking to cut some fat before I start working out after covid ends

Thanks!"
"152 lbs down and maintained for a decade Greetings all,

[Progress Photo (2010-2020)](https://ibb.co/YQGbpnb)

About 8 years ago, I posted my [152lbs weight loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/19fpnq/152_lbs_lost_anyone_can_do_it/) here on loseit.  At the time, I had been losing weight for about 2 years.

I just wanted to post an update showing its possible to keep weight loss long term. We have all seen the statistics that most dieters fail and regain most weight.  That statistic alone pushed me to not fail. 

For a little background, I started losing weight in 2010 after being sick and in pain consistently. I had an honest conversation with myself that the only thing I hadn't tried was a healthy lifestyle. I lost most of the weight simply restricting my calories and going for 20 minute walks a few times per week. 

As for the progress, the top row of photos are between 2009-2012. It took about two years to drop from 309+ lbs to 157 lbs (my highest verifiable recorded weight was 309, but I'm sure it was higher). 

The bottom row of photos show my progress from 2013-2020 as my love for bodybuilding and then powerlifting took over.  I actually sit around 200lbs these days, but its a much leaner 200. 

I will say that eating is forever a struggle for me.  Moderation is the hardest. I can operate under a strict diet well, or I can be totally unleashed and eat everything.  Its hard to have a middle ground for me. It does get easier to make better choices and live a certain way with time, but the desire to eat everything in sight never has gone away for me. 

There are always ups and downs. Changes in jobs, relationships, stress, and holidays have always impacted my weight.  The trick is being able to catch those trends and reverse course instead of giving up. 

I don't have any particular special knowledge to impart, but that investing in yourself is what you are doing by taking charge of your health, and its the best investment you can make. Being removed by this much time makes it feel like I'm looking at a different person entirely, its hard to remember everything from then now as I tend to rather look forward than back. 

If anyone has any particular questions or anything they want answered, I'll do my best to reply.  To the one question I always get: Yes, I have loose skin, had some removed and still have a ton. But no, I would never use that as a reason to not lose weight."
"18/6 going so well! But caffelatte?! I started my weight loss journey 2 weeks ago, and its been going so well. I love having rules. After 8PM? No food goes near my mouth. So my fasting period is between 2-8PM. 

I usually drink a morning coffee i somewhat enjoy, since i just got a new coffee maker a month ago. But it cant make caffelatte or cappuccino or stuff like that. So i bought a milkfrother/heater. And im now realising i cant drink my latte before 2PM, since its milk, and milk has calories, even the skim milk i get is 34 calories per 100ml. I get up at 10AM, and it makes me crazy that i can only make a nirmal cup of coffee!

 This breaks my heart. What do i do?"
"Am I restricting too much? 18/F/5’5, I initially started counting calories because I wanted to trim down a bit, nothing too major. My starting weight was 130. I’m not very active due to being a busy student in an urban environment, so I simply cut out desserts, processed foods, etc etc. Eventually I became so used to eating less that I didn’t even think twice about it. Flash forward a couple months, and it just hit me that I am barely eating 1100 calories a day. I’ve lost a bit of weight (currently 115), but I seem to be at a plateau and haven’t lost weight in a few weeks. I’m scared of eating less than I already do, but I also am scared of eating more out of fear of gaining back the weight I’ve lost so far. Am I damaging my metabolism?"
"I created a fast/binge cycle for myself and i don’t know how to get out of it I genuinely don’t remember when was the last time i sat down and had an actual meal with my family. i’ve been stuck/ fluctuating the same 3kgs the past 4 months or so i’m so sick of it and myself. i refuse to let myself be seen by any of my friends until i lose weight which doesn’t seem to be happening.
It became a habit, i go down to the kitchen and binge on the same things everyday, high calorie things i don’t even like or would never eat if it was any normal eating day. And then i’d feel so bad about eating, i fast the next day and then binge the day after. My brain is programmed to think that i’ll gain weight if i sit down and eat in a plate even though i know that’s not the case and what i’ve been doing is much worse. how do i get myself out of this habit?"
"I want to go back to my old weight Long story short,I suffered from severe depression and was basically home bound,I was always average or skinny,but I managed to put on a massive amount of weight,in recovery I started losing it and I reached my skinniest 52 kilos at 1,63.Now with the lockdown I’m starting to gain back a lot of weight which is a huge anxiety of mine,today I weighed 62 kilos and I know I’m still somewhat average but I felt most comfortable at 52.My problem is I start out fine,eating healthy,restricting etc,but after I week or two I start to binge.It feels like I almost need someone to micromanage me,because I literally forget my goals along the way."
"Plateau: M29 / 230lbs / 6’ - Help if possible. SW: 260lbs (Oct 2020) / CW 200lbs / GW 190-200lbs / 6ft 

Hi everyone,  

I have read into multiple posts / articles regarding plateaus and despite the information given I still can’t overcome mine.  The last time I lost a lb was about 6 weeks ago.  

For food it’s eggs (on whole wheat) in the morning if not oats.  Lunch/Dinner are generally the same: Chicken, broccoli, eggs again, mixed veggies, occasional rice, etc

Snacks/In-between meals include: Eggos, peanut butter toast, fruit.

Calories remain just above/below 2000 according to MFP.

For exercise I do a 4 day upper/lower split and I am seeing somewhat slow increase in strength there.  Cardio is 5-7 days a week.  A minimum of 20-30 mins of steady state.

I have weighed my food / counted my kcals better and I know this is partially body acclimation due to the way my clothes feel but I can’t help but feel I am lacking.  I as far away from processed foods as possible and I have had maybe 3 cheat meals in the past two months.  I don’t eat much in terms of sugar.  I swapped soda with zero sugar and focused primarily on water.  I did away with coffee (till I can find a recipe to make it sweet/taste good without 40g of sugar lol).  No sweets or anything.  Anyways any feedback at all is appreciated.  I’m somewhat patient but I want to make sure I am optimizing as much as possible.  

Thank you all in advance."
"I’ve hit the dreaded plateau... Hi! I’m a 5’1 female. My starting weight in January 2021 was 127 pounds. I lost 7 pounds in 5 weeks by reducing my calories to 1200 calories per day and increasing exercise. I’m now down to 120 pounds and I’ve been stuck there for 4 weeks despite weighing and tracking everything I eat (including oils, condiments, ect). I just can’t lose anymore weight and I would really like to as I’m still not quite happy and I’d like to get down to 110 pounds before I focus on any muscle. Does anyone have advice on how to get past the plateau? I do HIIT 3x a week, strength train 2x a week and average 13,000 steps per day. I go for a walk for at least 30 minutes 5x days a week. I’m scared to cut calories any further but I’m getting frustrated - I’m doing everything right and not seeing results anymore."
"Hi, 17M 290 lbs. here, wanting to tone down and actually commit to being healthier, but I don't know where to start. Sorry for formatting, on mobile. I've been overweight since 13, but I'll save you the backstory. All that matters to me is right now, I am 6' and 290 lbs, and I very much want to start cutting into that this year. I have ambitions of going into the Navy, and I'd like to start ASAP. 
I attend in person school 5 days a week, and the options for food are limited. I work 2 days a week at fast food and I usually eat there. My main problem is I'm not very experienced, and I can't make myself focus and learn through video tutorials. I've tried to find apps to get me started on exercising, I've tried to watch videos but none of the knowledge sticks. I also have a hard time committing to do something different than in my routine. My goal is to hit 230 by the end of the year. I have a hard time explaining what I want a lot of the time when I'm asking for help, so sorry if I haven't clarified on something."
"Getting Back in the Groove! 25(F) SW: 276lbs CW: 207lbs GW: 175lbs - So I started this wonderful weight loss journey a couple years ago. I would lose 20-30 lbs, maintain for a few months, gain 5 lbs back and then lose another 20-30 lbs just to do it all over again. Its not been a bad journey, actually it was really great once I genuinely started understanding how food and nutrients work in your body. However, I also had a good support system that I would share my accomishments and buy new clothes with, ect ect. This time though, I feel far more alone in it having relocated to a new state 2 months ago for my husband's work.

Well, I maintained my weight for a solid year before deciding right before COVID really hit that I was going to start losing again. I counted my calories, I hit my proteins, carbs and fat and exceeded my steps everyday and not a single budge. Worse, I was starting to feel really sick and tired all the time. Frustrated and angry, I said ""F*ck it, you look fine"" and threw myself a little tantrum - 10 months later, my beautiful son was born. 

He turned 4 months this past Tuesday and I was fortunate to come out of my long and arduous pregnancy (and 32 hr labor) only 10 lbs heavier than I went in. I decided last month, when I quit breastfeeding that it was time and I joined a gym again. 

Today, I stand 15.8 lbs lighter and just got home from my first step aerobics class which I will be attending every Wednesday (cardio on M/F and Yoga on Sundays). A friend referred me to reddit for the stock market threads and I ended up here, been lurking for a few days and decided I love the atmosphere. I hope this will make a fine replacement for the support I had back home.

Thanks and sorry for the long post lol"
"Anyone loose weight working an odd shift? So I'm in my mid 20s and I'm wanting to loose some fat I've gained over the last year. I get nutrition and workouts that work for me but I work 5-6pm-2am. The hours fluctuate daily since I work in a lab. 

I enjoy outdoor cardio but today I felt so groggy. I had trouble sleeping last night and woke up pretty tired even tho my fitbit states I got almost 8hrs of sleep.  

Today I was wanting to do outdoor cardio but it took my until the afternoon to shake off that grogginess and soon had to get ready to go work. 

When I was at my fittest I worked out either early in the morning or mostly late evening. It was easy to sleep early and wake up early and workout then go to class. 

Now I work nights and sometimes get cravings. My go to workouts are mostly outdoor cardio so I'm a little worried seeing is how late I wake up and missing the chance to workout before work since it gets pretty hot out.

So I may go to the gym off work just because I hate not being able to sleep and just thinking I couldve gotten a quick workout in."
"A Small Win: Sharing So as I’ve started this journey I never realized how bad my relationship with food really was. I knew I consumed too much junk and gained the weight ofc, but I never noticed I didn’t share. At all. Not with my son, or my husband. I’d go so far as to hide things and my son was told no so often he’d stop asking and get visibly down any time I had junk food and he didn’t. 

I never realized it until I fell off the wagon this weekend. I bought some junk food. I ate some, but not all. I was so proud that even tho I wasn’t eating what I should, I wasn’t binging. Then my husband pointed out that I had even shared with my son and how giddy he got. 

Honestly it hit me hard. I don’t think he knew I hadn’t realized because I straight up stared at him and asked “I never shared with him?”  Looking back I could remember getting half a dozen boxes of junk I would eat in an hour sitting (no I’m not exaggerating) and I couldn’t remember sharing a single piece with him. 

But now I’m not only not binging (okay so some chips and a couple Oreos still aren’t good in place of a meal but it wasn’t two family size packages of both at least), I’m also sharing what I get. Healthy and not. 

Thank you all, I haven’t been here long but it feels great to be able to share/vent all this out. ❤️"
"Update after a while/semi-success story! (Lost 10+ pounds) I made a post a long time ago seeking help as a close-to-be overweight, 140-pound, 5'5 13-year-old female. I was in a rough time in my life where my looks were my biggest insecurity including my body fat. I received so much wonderful feedback and although my journey took a while with lots of faults it's in so much of a better place now. I'm now standing at around 128 pounds and for the most part, I'm content with the way I look. I still strive for more but it's great knowing I'm at least doing something to create a change.

When I first began, I realized that my daily diet before thinking about what I ate was junk food, junk food, and more junk food. I went days realizing just how hungry I was when I cut out unnecessary snacks because those had always been my main sources of food. Over time, however, I've learned to cook on my own! I now create dinners for my family of different cuisines and styles of things I find online. Bless my parents' wonderful hearts who've helped me this whole time with dealing my mad food ingredient shopping sprees haha.

For the most part, I made sure to keep up a lot with what I ate. At times it was rough but I wish I had told myself counting calories every day or restraining myself so much to the point where I'd chew up food and spit it out was just not the best way to go through with things. At the moment, I'm able to eat what I enjoy while making sure to keep food proportions and better options in mind. Want a snack? Instead of grabbing that chocolate switch it up with a favorite fiber bar brand or a banana! It was as simple as that but I had a junk food addiction for so long. Besides food though, I'm most proud of my workouts. I've completed a 28-day Chloe Ting workout program and I'm now able to jog a whole mile without stops! I've achieved so much and I've come to love and adore exercising because of the rush and stress release it gives me. Of course, I still blunder a lot but overall I've gotten a lot better with myself. I know this is a subreddit on losing weight but, losing weight is just part of this journey and the mentality you gain around it is just so much more. I know I'm still young, like, really young but I'm glad I started early. I'm glad I was able to take control and start living my life more like a kid. I'm not too lazy to go outside or run around anymore, I have so much more energy. I've been able to climb up my patio to my rooftop just for the sake of being able to live more. This went off into a bit of a wholesome rant though, I apologize!"
"A year later and now 3 pictures Hey everyone again.

So exactly 1 year ago I made a post called  [1 year, 40lbs down and swore I'd only take 2 pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/fd38hg/1_year_40lbs_down_and_swore_id_only_take_2/) and I thought to myself, after the year that we've all had, I'd like to do a follow up.

Where should I begin... well a lot has happen to all of us in the last 365 days. We had to stop going out as much as we did, businesses closed their doors, our offices told us to work from home, our homes became our offices, and some of us haven't seen co-workers in almost a year. Through all this I learned quite a few things about myself.

1: I'm an extrovert and I need the energy of other people around me. This not seeing people or going out really took a toll on my mental health.

2: Long walks with my pup are a doable thing during lunch and a really good way for me to destress.

3: A lot of hard work went down the drain due to over eating and snacking because the kitchen is 15 feet away.

4: I love cooking now that I have more time for it and trying all new recipes from around the world. I've expanded my mid west pallet far beyond what I ever thought it could be.

I'm currently 157lbs which means I'm 2lbs away from my goal weight. Looking at my pictures I'm guessing some of that is muscle but still I kept at it and results are slow but they exist. I was scared to take a picture of myself this afternoon after looking in the mirror but in the end I thought this is life, my life and I am happy that I didn't slip complete back into old habits and back up to 200lbs. So here is my visual documentation of life. (**NSFW Shirtless**) [https://imgur.com/a/i3cRDGO](https://imgur.com/a/i3cRDGO)

This part is for all of you reading this.

I am god damn proud of you all for keeping up with your routines, your awareness of lifestyle choices and dedication. Its been a nightmare of a year that most of us thought couldn't or wouldn't ever happen in our life time but you kept at it. Big victories and small they should all be celebrated. For those of you that fell on and off the wagon like myself through the roller coaster of our lives, its not to late and if you want to keep up for yourself I'm proud of you too. I'm no where near where I wanted to be and that's ok and I've become ok with that. Doesn't mean I'm not going to keep trying and I ask none of you to give up either.

Here's to the next 365 days.

If you made it this far thank you for reading. If you have questions, or anything, or want to share your side please do."
"I NEED HELP!!.(Weight Loss) I am 19y/o and 6’2 and about 198lbs. I used to be very active before quarantine, playing soccer and sometimes lifting weights so i put on a bit of muscle mass but since last year April to Christmas, i put in a whole lot of weight and body fat all around my belly area. I havent had access to the gym or to play soccer so i just stay home, studying and chilling around. I eat junk food sometimes because im too lazy to cook but im sure that everything i eat is way less than 1000 cal per day. (I used to eat about 2kcal per day and was in shape). Even though i eat less and somedays i dont even eat at all, i still look exactly the same or even add more weight. I tried intermittent fasting for a month (22:2) and still got no results. Little fluctuations and then additional weight. I would love to go on a diet and eat more veggies but i really cant handle eating them as i do not enjoy it and wont be able to keep it going for long but i do love my proteins. I just want to find a way to be able to sustain my weight in a quarantine from my diet since i dont yet have access to the gym and sports stuff. Would someone please help me with a diet recommendation as well as how much water intake i should take daily and any tips if possible?"
"Am I Losing Weight in a Healthy Way? Hey guys!

(26F) SW: 160lb CW: 124lb GW 115lb 5'3. 

I have lost about 35lbs over the course of about 9 months now and I wanted to make sure I was losing weight at a healthy pace. I usually eat 1600 calories a day and always make room for treats within those calories and go for walks a couple times a week. I have gotten a couple comments about my weight loss recently that made me worried. Someone commented that I had lost too much weight and another mentioned that I am anorexic and that kind of threw me off. The only thing that worries me a little is being a little obsessed with watching weight loss videos, what I eat in a day, etc. I just wanted to make sure the changes I've made haven't been to drastic. I feel so much better than I used to and the calories I fit in a day feel like enough to keep me satisfied and I'm getting close to my goal. Thoughts?"
How do you handle comments? I'm [25F] on a weight loss journey and it's been a couple months I've lost a good bit of weight but I'm not near my goal weight... A couple of people have already started to notice it and commented but today in particular a coworker was asking me in detail if I've lost weight and what am I doing to lose weight and what my goals are etc. I just said thank you and I've been eating healthy that's all. Kept it short. I just feel so awkward because I'm very introverted and shy especially when it comes to these things. I really don't want to be talking about myself and especially not about my weight loss journey I find it personal. My question is.. How do you handle comments the right way and is it normal that I feel this strange about it?
"Here We Go Again 32 - NB - 5' 4"" - 164(?) lbs.

This past year sucked. I'm sure that's the understatement of the century. But it's been extra hard for me. I had just moved to a new city, lost my job, and have just been generally depressed and anxious. I was 148 when I moved here, which was 10 lbs up from where I wanted to be. But now, I see I'm headed back in a dangerous direction. 

I've been 200 lbs several times in my life and I never want to go back to that point. I told myself I was going to turn myself around when I got to 155. And then again at 160. But I'm having a hard time giving a fuck. I'm accountable to no one. I don't even care enough about myself to feel like I owe it to myself. So I realized I need to actually interact with people who remind me about the importance of what I'm doing. 

So I'm trying to just... get back to it. Start tracking in a meaningful consistent way. I haven't managed to do this longer than 5 days in the past year so it's time to try returning to reddit."
"Lost period? 26/5'2/F 

Start weight: 155 
Cw: 141 

Hi guys. I started taking getting the quarantine weight off and picking my healthy habits back up at the end of January. I had been working out since December, but I really buckled down for february. 

I lost 15 lbs. 

And now my period is M.I.A 

I'm concerned it's because of the weight loss? Am I working out too much? I don't know. I was afraid my copper IUD had failed, so I took a pregnancy test today: negative. 

I'm not sure what my course of action next should be. I eat 1200 a day which is only a 400 calorie deficit for sedentary at my height. I work out 45-60 min Mon-Fri. 

Is this normal?"
"30 Day Accountability Challenge - Day 3 Hello losers,

Wednesday is here. Looking much like Tuesday with a little more hump. 

Weigh in daily, enter into Libra &amp; report here even if I don't like it: No weigh in this morning, 229.9 lbs trend weight. Facing the music tomorrow &amp; hoping my mornings quit being so, weird. I hadn't meant to skip any weigh ins &amp; the universe just keeps handing me weird mornings that throw me off my game.

Stay within calorie range (1800): Not super jazzed about it but today maybe another maintenance day. I'm going to be real with you losers, life has to happen around weight loss &amp; sometimes it's a scary world. 1/1 days.

Exercise 5 days a week: 30 minute lunch walk plus 30 minute stationary bike. 3/3 days.

Self-care time (journaling, beauty treatments, anything that fills the bucket, non food rewards): Guys. I'm going to put my laundry away, I swear. Mostly because finding all the clothes &amp; a mask plus changing into work out gear from a pile is massively annoying.

Try a new recipe once a week: Nothing yet, although I tried the pickled peppers from last month &amp; those need to happen again for sure, with more exciting seasonings &amp; types of peppers. Also I'm getting some bok choy in my next produce order so that's going to be a learning curve too! X/4 weeks.

Express mindfulness and or gratitude: Today I am grateful for living in a world that has a way better understanding of introvert versus extrovert &amp; mental health issues. We have access to so much knowledge. It is genuinely a beautiful thing. 

Also, cats. Because toe beans.

Your turn kids!"
"A calorie deficit without workout will burn muscle? I will have to stop my workout routine for 3-4 weeks due to a surgery (At 3rd week i could start doing some light workout). Im currently a bit overweight (167pounds 5'10"").

I've been hitting (pretty intense) the gym 4-5 days a week since 2-3 months ago and i already did some progress. I am in a calorie deficit of about 500cal/day. Could i continue with that deficit? If i keep the deficit without the workout it will have a negative impact on my little gain?

Would be really sad lose most of my progress for a 3-4 weeks of recovery. But also pretty frustating being forced to spent one entire month eating 1800cal a day when i really wanna just stay on diet and keep losing weight."
"Some of my recent/favorite NSVs and a Question About Lifting So I didn't want to post until I hit the big 200lbs lost mark but I couldn't help myself. I had Bypass surgery on 06/30/2020. Stats are as follows: 33/M 5'8"" HW: 403, SW: 357, CW: 216. 

In total I've lost 187lbs its been crazy with body changes over the past 8 months. Sometimes it's hard other times it's smooth sailing. Taking moments to recognize NSVs when they happen are small moments of joy I have started to revel in. 

For starters, I live a country life. I have a pickup truck and for the first time I no longer exceed the weight capacity of the tailgate and can actually sit on it to relax!! It's so simple yet so pleasing. 

Next is that any vehicle I get into to drive I have to adjust the seat WAAAY forward most of the time because I have to get closer and no longer have my gut sitting in my way! 

Lastly, I built my 2 kids matching loft beds a few months ago. I can now comfortably climb the ladder and get into the bed and goof around with my kids when they are being silly. It was right after dinner and they thought it was hilarious until daddy ripped a fart and my almost 7 yr old daughter wasn't haven't that and demanded I leave for ruining her bed lmao. 

What can I say, my energy has skyrocketed my outlook on life is changing almost daily. I'm working to be a volunteer firefighter to eventually become full-time. I am just loving ALMOST every minute of this new life I have. I say almost as obviously life has it's up's and down's...and loose skin.

I have so much loose skin that frustrates the crap out of me. It's nasty, wrinkly, shrinkly and just overall disgusting. It is a huge mental blow. I am being sent in July for a consult to plastic surgery for skin removal as that will be my 1yr surgeversary. There are conditions that have to be met for insurance and I don't know if I'll meet them or not (every seems to think I will but I don't). So this leads to my question. I am looking for a workout program that doesn't involve bulking up. I'm not looking to get swole. I'm looking to lean up and gain strength/definition. Everything I find on r/fitness and other like subs seems to be pushing about increasing strength and 1 rep max lifts. I'm not looking for that, increased strength will be a byproduct sure but I need to tighten up, well, everything. Any advice or recommendations is appreciated. Thanks for reading! I'll be sure to post pics when I hit the big 200lb lost!"
"Nothing huge, but still (+a diabetic question) Just feeling hopeful for the first time this morning. For context, I’m 30f, a type one diabetic (so I’ve been told it would be very difficult to lose weight), and started at 103kg/227lbs. Very depressed, so was too friendly with alcohol. So I quit drinking almost 3 weeks ago.

As of this morning I’m under 100kg/220lbs again, just by sticking to 1200cal a day and kicking wine to the curb. I found a non-alcoholic (and very low calorie) rosé that has replaced my usual choice of drink, and I’m letting myself enjoy food again that I usually shunned because “it’s too high in carbs.” I hadn’t had a banana in 3 years until a couple of weeks ago.

I know I’m still very overweight but the fact that the scale is trending down for the first time in 3 years makes me happy. I’m considering returning to keto, but it’s a bit tricky as I’m a vegetarian.

Anyways, that’s my hurrah. I was wondering if there are other t1 diabetics here, and how you’ve made weight loss more successful? My endocrinologist said the best way is to cut down on insulin (so, eating a low carb diet). Any other advice would be great :)"
"M24/6'5/300lbs-200lbs (1 Year) Hey guys/gals. Longtime lurker here. Been getting inspired by all of you for years but sadly never did much about it until March when lockdown started in the US. Anyways in my little pit of sulking and feeling bad for myself I decided to make a change. I started moving and eventually loved what I was doing. We are nearing our 1 year anniversary of lockdown so it is easy for me to keep track of the time frame. As of this morning I have successfully lost 100 pounds / 45.3kg. I started at M22, 6'5 300lbs+ (I stoped weighing myself at 300lbs) to 200lbs as of this morning.

Not sure how to post pics in this thread but for those interested I have a before/after on my page. 

Anyways, how have all of you struggled with loose skin? I have very minimal and I am so thankful but it still irritates me. Most noticeable is in my lower chest/abdomen area. I have little to no muscle in those areas so I am hoping that I can fill it up in the next year or so with muscle. Does anybody have advice who has been in this similar situation."
"Proteins and Calories Intake - Lose Weight I'm 169cm (5.6 foot) and my bodyweight is 70kg (154 pounds). I have too much body fat, especially in my belly, the rest of the body hasn't that much fat I'd say. I used to go to the gym, which is now closed because of the pandemic, so I'm working out at home and I try to measure my calories and proteins intake so I can lose weight (body fat) while maintaining body mass. I saw a video on youtube that gave sort of a formula for that, I did the maths and the result was that my daily protein intake should be around 140/150g and my daily calorie intake should be around 2070 calories.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand a lot about it so I'm kinda lost here and think it's too much calories and protein for somebody like me who wants to lose body fat. What's your say in this and what do you think? Please let me know."
"I am not a failure. 24F 5’0 SW: 200.8lbs CW: 181.4lbs GW: 115lbs

I started my weight loss journey back in April of 2020 after babysitting for a friend and using her scale to weigh myself because it had been years since I had done so. I had weighed in at 200.8, 25lbs heavier than the last time I remembered weighing myself. I always told myself I would never get to 200lbs but here I was, .8 over 200lbs. 

Immediately I started trying to lose weight, but I knew from my high school experiences that fad diets just didn’t work for me. I had to change my entire lifestyle as a whole in order for my weight loss to be successful. Due to the pandemic, I was not working and this acted as a blessing for me. I went for walks everyday, I was cooking all my meals at home. My biggest issue was my diet. I had years and years of stuffing myself with fast food and processed junk and I really wanted to put most of the focus on my eating habits and creating sustainable meals for myself to prevent over eating. I struggle with food a lot so rather than forcing myself to completely change my diet and keep up with regular exercise, I did more leisurely activities like going for walks and bike rides so I didn’t have too much pressure on myself. Slowly I would see a pound lost, and another, and another. It was a slow process but I didn’t care, I was making successful changes and I was so proud. By the end of the year, I was at 181.4. 

Now, -19.4lbs in 8 months may not seem like a huge deal. I definitely could have lost more. But this was the LONGEST I had ever stuck to a “diet” in my entire life. I had not gained the weight back, I had maintained the loss and that was incredible to me. 

I, like many others, suffer from SAD. Oct-Mar can be rough for me. Particularly this year has been bad. But guess what? I have still maintained my weight loss while only fluctuating by about 5lbs. (depending on the time of the month) and I am still so amazed at myself that almost a year later I have still maintained that 19.4lb loss. That, along with learning to love who I am throughout this last year, has been my biggest accomplishment in my entire life. 

While I still have a ways to go, this is a reminder to myself and anybody else out there who is struggling with their weight and feeling like they could have lost more from when they started to now, what you have done for yourself is amazing and you deserve to be proud of the changes you have made in your life regardless of if you could have lost more. 

Maintaining my weight during the toughest time of the year for my mental health has been the biggest win to date in my journey. While I was so close to giving up because I felt like I could have done more, I am reminding myself that what I have done is create a successful mentality towards myself and towards food. I am NOT a failure and this is NOT the end of my journey. It may take years but that will no longer deter me from wanting to keep going, and I hope it doesn’t deter you either!"
"Need help losing weight/starting my journey Hello everyone. I’m a 5ft female and I’m 59kg. I want to go down to 50kg. Overall, my entire life I’ve always been “medium” or average weight and I want to change that. I’m not sure where to start. How do I even lose weight?

I don’t necessarily have bad eating habits. I just have a sweet tooth. I don’t drink anything besides milk or water. I cut out sodas. I don’t eat out bc I’m cheap and I like eating at home.

"A Year of Lifting in Lockdown: SW (210) to GW (176). **TL;DR progress made this year: https://imgur.com/a/e1wsVCk**

Long time lurker here, but I wanted to add my story and journey the past year through lockdown!

My weight loss journey has been sporadic over the past four years. I was at my heaviest in 2018 where I was around 230 pounds due to overeating from constant jabs from my coworkers that I was too skinny. After I gained weight, those same coworkers made fun of me for having gained weight. This hurt my self-esteem pretty severely. I eventually left that position, which was one I had strived for since childhood.

With a cratered self-esteem and a lull in employment in 2019, I tried to drop some pounds and get fit. It didn’t work too well. I focused too much on cardio and lifting and not enough on creating a strict diet. I was famished most nights and due to the deficit from an hour of cardio plus lifting while eating 1200 calories. I quickly lost 20 pounds. After two months of this, I began overeating and put back on 5 of those pounds.

I decided this didn’t work for me. I wanted to get muscle. I wanted to be thinner. I wanted to stop doing so much cardio. 

And that’s what I did.

I almost completely cut out cardio in 2020. Instead, I focused on flexibility, form, and “jumping rope.” That’s in quotes because I didn’t own an actual jump rope until Christmas. I was around 210 at the start of this time

From March until October, I focused on eating 2000 calories with macros of Protein &gt; Fat &gt; Carbs. I hadn’t restricted myself on food and I’ve eaten dirty almost the entire time. Taco Bell, Popeyes, Chick-fil-A or some random take out around 7 times a month. The other days were a protein with veggies and a legume or other carb. My favorite preparation was a dry rub on a cheap cut of steak which was reverse seared and finished with a searing in the pan.

November, I am starting my cut around 195. At the end of the month, I am at 200. My SO and I got a CostCo membership and I may or may not have eaten a 40 count of Takis in 5 days before eating an entire bag of cheese in the middle of the night to avoid it from spoiling.

I restarted my cut December 1st where I followed a [routine by /u/LukeatanPeninsula to the T.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/3cudaa/cutting_101/) in my modest home gym of a power rack, a bar, 1 pair of 10,25,35,45 bumpers, and a bench.

"I will literally binge on anything. I bought 3 protein bars today, thinking that i’d be able to control myself and eat them as meal replacements like you’re supposed to. But no. I ate all three of them within an hour. I have absolutely no self control and will eat literally whatever I can get my hands on. I dont know why or how to stop myself. I’m almost to the point where i’m just going to say fuck it and accept that i’ll be fat forever. I’m at an average/ healthy weight rn (5’1, 120 lbs, female 20) but I know that i’m gaining weight bc i’ve been consistently eating 2000-3000 calories a day when my maintenance amount is 1500. Does anyone have any advice for how to stop binging?"
"Getting to 8% body fat hi everyone i'm 27 and i have lost about 35 lbs after a dirty bulk (and gained 5 lbs of muscle during the bulk) and now i'm around 12% body fat and i want to get down to 8% and during this 8 month weight loss i was losing about 4 lbs a month but now i think the weight loss has slowed down so my question is how much does weight loss slow down when you are already lean with visible six pack at 12% bf?i have been eating around 1500 calories a day and i do a 10 min hiit session or 1 hour of walking or even both every day but still the weight loss has slowed down.i have heard that weight loss rate can slow down even at 0.25 lbs a month but i think this happens only if you try to get down to extreme levels of 4-5% body fat for a competition.i'm an ectomorph btw but more on the skinny-fat side,so not pure ripped ectomorph."
"You all helped me a lot. Thank You Hello there. I am 33M, 190cm (6ft3), SW: 99kg (219lb), GW: 84kg (185lb), CW: 83.8kg (185lb).  
I wrote whole my story - wall of text about my backstory, my 3.5 month weightloss journey, but then I deleted it. Something just clicked and I felt such a relief after that. So Ill try to keep it short.

   
Luckily I found this sub couple months ago, just when I needed and you helped me to push thru. Even though I just lurked here, but found a lot of amazing stories about amazing people, got anwears and tips.  
I started this weightloss for health reasons (blood test wich I did just for fun because my wife was doing it, showed that my cholesterol was thru the roof). Counted calories, changed my eating habits, picked up running and did a lot of workouts, whenever I could, wherever I could. Was running in  -20°C ( -4°F) cold. Was doing pushups secretly at work in bathroom, whatever it takes. I wanted to get healthier sooo bad until my babygirl will come to this world (any day now, yay).   
Did my second blood test couple days ago - it works, my cholesterol is a lot better (just tiny tiny bit over normal, but I will get there). I am in decent shape (after 12-13 years of eating sh\*tload of sugar and unhealthy foods I can finally see my abs!), I can run for an hour non stop, I learned a lot about healthier food, my body, my mind, my and other people struggles with weight...

I am so happy today. Thank You all. I was inspired by Your succes stories and was encouraged by failures too. Just find whatever drives You forward. Keep going, You can do it. I wish you all the best. With Love."
"How much weight (fat) can I lose within 1, 2 and 3 months? I am really want to lose body fat. I gained a lot due to COVID. I have lost around 10 pounds since Sept, which is really slow movement. I'm also trying to work on my mental health. I am currently 17 and am 5'3"". I have decent running experience, and I think I am going to try to re-intergrate that into my weekly routine. I struggle with avoiding sweets and binge eating (any thoughts and suggestions would be great). I'd really love to get a slim body to have the confidence to wear shorts and short sleeves. 

Background for running: I used to be able to pop off 6 miles really easily at a 10min pace. Currently I could probably do 3miles at a 11min pace. As you can see I've fallen."
"Need Help Starting/Keeping Motivated This is my first post like this and one I was mulling for quite a long time as I still get so embarrassed/anxious about how I feel about myself and how others perceive me. I’m a 5’11 man in my 20s weighing around 244 and I absolutely hate how I look when I check the mirror, or how I feel with my exercise. 

The start of my weight gain dates back to my senior year of high school, when I was in the best shape I had ever been in. During my senior sports season, I tore my ACL (along with many other ligaments) and quickly fell into a deep depression from it. For that summer I was nearly unable to walk after surgery, of course gaining weight and losing muscle over time. 

Then came college and the “Freshman 15” which I soon learned wasn’t a myth, and then the pandemic nearly a year after. After the injury and weight gain, i struggled immensely with finding motivation to get back into my workout routines, be it pain from the knee, pushing other priorities over top of it, or something else all together. Then at the beginning of quarantine for me in the early summer, I had an opportunity to work out more as there wasn’t much for me to do back home, losing 20 pounds rather quickly and on track to where I wanted to be. But I soon was afflicted with another lower body injury that sidelined be for a few weeks and took my motivation with it. 

Flash forward to now, the heaviest I’ve ever been, and the most out of shape I’ve ever been. My lifestyle now is one I know is bad and one I need to fix, as it’s hurting my self confidence and motivation to do anything else within my life. The ideal goal would be to lose 40 pounds at least, get near 200 or just under it. I know what to do for workouts and how to workout once I’m in the gym, but I’ve never Struggled so much with starting and keeping my motivation going. I really believe if I can get on the right path for a week or two, I can reach the goals I need to accomplish. 

Long story short, I’d love some advice on how to start my journey, or would love to hear from anyone who thinks they could help. It would mean a lot to me."
"Is the only way to lose weight just starving yourself and eating egg whites and chicken every day over and over again? Hi, this “diet” I’m on with oatmeal, egg whites, almond milk, and chicken every day is working and I am losing weight... very very slowly, like 2 pounds a week after one cheat meal. Okay I know that is not slowly, that is fast. However I almost feel unmotivated to cook or eat anything because I’m sick of eating the same bland food (and yes I know how to make chicken taste good) over and over again, and just wanna be innocent living life not fast food every day but like cold cuts, burgers, whole eggs, toast etc. I used to play basketball 6 times a week for hours and eat these things and lose LOTS of weight, but now with covid and me being in NY with basketball hoops locked everywhere, I cant use that and must diet, and I gotta say it sucks. How can you eat this shit every day? I can see every 2-3 days but its so repetitive and makes me not want to eat.

I swear one of these days eating the same old shit EVERY DAY, my cravings are gonna get to me and make me go to Wendys and get a baconator and say fuck this same food stuff lol"
"Down 16 pounds in 48 Days!! http://imgur.com/a/oyMl97M

6'1"" Male. 25 years old

Started calorie deficit at 200lbs. Maintenance was 2900, been eating 2100/2200 every day for 48 Days straight. Eating 180+ grams of protein a day. Making sure to get close on my macros each day. Macros are at 40% carbs, 35% protein, 25% fats. Track/weigh everything I eat. 

Started going to the gym 3 days a week. 15 mins of cardio each gym day, 1 hour of weight training. Switch it up weekly from high weight low reps --&gt; lower weight high reps --&gt; Medium weight time under tension. Now going 4/5 days a week. Lost weight but actually feel much stronger. Definitely put on muscle while losing. Before this I'd go on hot streaks of going to the gym, but never was this consistent with both eating and training. I was only 142lbs at 20 years old and made it a goal to hit 180ish. Did that, then quarantine and drinking got the best of me, and I hit my all time heaviest at 200lbs, then decided to do this. Best I've felt physically ever I feel. 

Also, I've been stuck at 184/185 for a week now. Any suggestions?? Should I go back to maintenance for a bit? Maybe stagger my calorie days, but keep the week average the same? I know a week isn't a lot, but I was losing like 2lbs a week consistently, now nothing. Kind of stumped. My original goal weight when I started was 180."
"What are some of the expected or rather unexpected health benefits you've noticed after losing weight? What kind of health problems you managed to treat or potentially reverse with weight loss? I'm 26 years old, male. I am heavily overweight – 186 cm (6'1"") / 130 kg (286 lbs) – however, due to my bulky nature, most of the weight surrounds my belly. While I don't want to blame everything on one thing, my weight grew extensively over several years since I do suffer from depression which really messed my whole *taking care of yourself* philosophy.

I'm a very anxious person. So, as you would assume, I'm also a massive hypochondriac, but that has elevated to new heights since I lost a loved one due to health related issues last year. Of course, being stuck at home hasn't helped with that either. For example, I had a coloscopy done on me last month which turned out to be nothing.

While I don't have any serious diagnosed medical conditions *just yet*, there are some that manifested over the years, such as GERD, mild fatty liver, elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and all that. In short, all of my blood tests and regular check ups are showing that my weight isn't contributing anything to my long-term health.

I finally accepted the fact that the only way to beat my health anxiety is to actually start getting healthy. While I do want to *look better* as much as the next person, I have a couple of *cosmetic health* conditions that prevents me from having a better self-esteem about myself either way. So, I primarily want to feel and get more healthy, which is way more important for me right now.

So, for some motivational boost, I wanted to ask what are some health problems you managed to treat or potentially reverse with weight loss? Maybe something that seemed completely unexpected to you or you didn't even know you had."
"Does anyone reward themselves when they get to a milestone? I was thinking about setting up a reward system for myself for weight loss. I’ve kind of already started and I feel it’s working as a motivator. Every 10 lbs I lose i’ve decided to buy myself a new workout or dressy outfit. Has anyone else done this?

My starting weight is 215 lbs and I’ve already lost 5 lbs. I’ve decided to buy myself airpods for when I’m walking outside for exercise. My next goal will be 205 when I’m going to buy myself a  sports bra for home workouts. After that, I’m going to buy myself an outfit every 10 lbs dropped. I’m doing this not only as a reward system but also to see at the end of my journey how far I’ve come in size."
"What do you do on your last mile? Hello!

I come here for some advice, I am reaching the point where everything goes to sh\*t when I am losing weight. I aim to reach 67- 65 KG, currently at 69.5. I am really aprehensive because I've been here before, I get to the goal (which is based on both aesthetic and medical reasons). And then I bounce back 4-5 kg.  
I went to the doctor last time this happened, they made me go on an elimination diet and I realized I seem to be highly intolerant to some foods, after cutting them out I started losing weight again. I am working out 4-5 times a week and have changed my habits and I am way more active and honestly I am feeling great.

But the doubt creeps up, now that I see that goal. I am worried I will go back, or that I am not doing enough. I know it is a journey, that doesn't have to be linear and of course it will get better.

I guess I wanted to ask you for your own experiences and strategies you took when nearing this part. I feel I have systems in place, and I try to honor them and follow them but it seems like I still can't shake the feleing of failure :c"
"Confused about weight fluctuations TL/DR: I haven’t lost any weight in 9 days despite expecting 2+ lbs of weight loss just like I was doing for the previous 5 weeks. I’m not familiar with how much my body weight can fluctuate, even in the middle of a diet, and need some clarification on that.

Here’s the full story: So I began a full-fledged diet back in January (I’m a 5’10 male). I was 230 lbs on January 15th. Started eating less than 1800 calories a day. During the first 5 weeks, I averaged about 2 lbs/week weight loss (I weighed in at 219 lbs on Feb. 22). Since then, it’s been about a week and a half, during that week, I went back up to 224, then 222, and now 219 as of this morning. Admittedly, I do not consistently weight in at the same time every day. Nothing has changed except that I further restricted my diet to 1500 cal/day about 3 weeks ago (meaning I should be losing more weight). How has there been no average weight loss? It feels really discouraging with how much work I’m putting into living a more healthy lifestyle.

I knew that weight fluctuations were a thing, but by how much do they usually fluctuate? 

Does anyone else have a similar story to how they ran into a weight “wall” so-to-speak? Did you overcome it?

Btw, I love reading the stories on here. They always provide so much encouragement for me!

Thanks :)"
"Standard v. Personalized Adaptive in LoseIt App 25F 5'5 SW : 161 CW : 130 GW : 125?

Hi all! I have been using LoseIt for almost a year now and have always used their ""Standard"" when selecting a calorie budget type. My budget has been around 1250-1300 since I started, though there are days I definitely go over (I can't resist a glass of wine). 

I just saw there is another option under Budget titled ""Personalized Adaptive"". It sounds really similar to Standard. Has anyone used this before? Did you see any changes? Positive or negative?

When I switched to Personalized Adaptive it bumped my calorie budget up to 1700. Also, I have been stagnant at 130 lbs since November. I know that it is CICO but why would it give me 400 more calories for the same .5 lbs per week goal? Thanks!"
"5’3” female SW: 169 CW: 141 GW: 120 28 pounds down in 6 months; 5’3” female SW: 169 CW: 141

I have no one to share this with so I’m sharing it here. I’m 20 pounds away from my goal weight. I started logging everything I ate but did nothing with that information for a very long time. Just ate how I ate and logged it... this winter my personal life changed immensely, and to distract myself from my world falling apart I started eating healthier... only started exercising a month ago. I feel like I have kicked it into high gear, like 100% effort like 2 weeks ago and I’m so excited to see what happens now.

Beginning in November I began actually making an effort to eat under 1500 calories a day, but still eating whatever I wanted. I use to have a few drinks every day (seltzers or beers or wine) and started drinking only occasionally around this time.

January is when I began only cooking for one (not including my son, who isn’t on my eating plan) so I stopped getting takeout during the week (previously I would get takeout a few times a week) and eating no more than 1500 calories a day strictly, usually around 1400. I was still very sedentary. Oh, and I started drinking green tea a few times a day (about 4 cups a day).

February is when I began exercising about 5 times a week. I am generally speaking very sedentary in my day to day life, only walking my dog (English bulldog so she’s pretty sedentary too) and working from home. I started running (I’m slow, running about a 12 minute mile in my very hill-y area in SF) 3 times a week and doing some kettlebell workouts and resistance bands on my own 4 times a week or so.

In the last month, to now, I’m feeling more energetic than I have since I was a kid. I use to be tired all the time. I don’t feel hungry in between meals. It was hard to train myself to not let myself pig out on whatever after work after eating light all day long. I feel more in control and capable than ever. The personal life stuff is still crushing to me but every day it’s a little easier. It’s starting to fade into the rear view.... instead of being something I fixated on daily. Thanks for reading."
"I tried working out again and failed. I'm a 23 year old 1m80 guy who used to lift and run (I got quite slim but never reached any of my goals).  I've done a lot of different meal plans and a few years ago found one that suits me and managed to lose 10kg. 

Recently though I hit my heaviest; weighing in at 103.1kg last month I started dieting again. Two weeks after I started, I began doing some basic exercises 3 times a week and have kept it up until now.  
Despite having lost 4kg since I started, each workout seems to get harder and harder and I couldn't get half way through today's.  


I'm in a caloric deficit so I wasn't expecting to make any gains but I was told to workout to maintain muscle mass-I've not noticed getting any smaller, just no strength whatsoever...  
Nothing I'm doing is particularly strenuous but I just don't have the energy-strength to do even half of it any more.  
I would go do cardio instead but I'm worried it'll push me further into a deficit and make me even weaker, putting me off the whole thing; especially since I'd be doing everything with 20 more kgs to what I'm used to...  


I'd really like some advice, should I be doing cardio instead or should I persevere with the strength training and just do really *really* easy exercises ?  
Thank you !x"
"Minimum calorie intake? Hi everyone. My stats are in my flair. I am not sure what the minimum number of calories I should eat is. The FAQ says ""recommended daily calorie minimums (1200 for women, 1500 for men, 1600 for adolescents,"" and I am a female adolescent near/at the end of puberty.

To be clear, I don't count calories because I can get obsessive about it, and I am just being more mindful of my food and eating primarily WFPB (and also doing yoga every day and going for long walks 3-4 times a week), which seems to be working so far! That gives me a clue of what my daily deficit is.

I'm just curious what amount would be bad to go under, since I am aiming for a 500 calorie deficit a day for 1 pound lost a week (which is about the rate I've been at for the past 3 weeks). [https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=imperial&amp;g=female&amp;age=16&amp;lbs=147&amp;in=69&amp;act=1.55&amp;f=1](https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=imperial&amp;g=female&amp;age=16&amp;lbs=147&amp;in=69&amp;act=1.55&amp;f=1) This calculator says my basal metabolic rate is around 1500 calories, but I think on some days where I don't exercise my total calorie expenditure probably &lt;2000 calories. So how would I safely achieve a deficit on those days?

&amp;#x200B;

\[Context: I have been at 135-6 for the past 3 years, ever since I stopped growing in height, but gained 15 lbs in fall from pandemic stuff/stress/business/lack of caring. Now, I am trying to lose it and return to my original weight in a healthy and sustainable manner.\]"
"How do you make yourself take walks? I have this thing where I just dislike walks. I find them boring, especially taken alone. And especially during the Canadian winter.

Before the plague, I would probably walk 45+ mins a day without necessarily noticing. Getting from point A to point B. Walking was part of living life, and walking had an aim and a destination.

Gyms have been closed here since... September, October? Yeah, it's insane. Literally all that exists now is subpar body weight exercises at home and walking. I feel like I should walk more because I feel like my physical health has gone down. But I have a lot of trouble convincing myself to do it because I hate aimless walks so much."
"Feeling very tired and drained during the day after changing diet? After giving up coke, chocolate bars and crisps / chips (1- 2 of each per day) last week I have been feeling really tired and sluggish. What I am finding with my new healthier diet, switching those unhealthy snacks for fruit, veggies or a few nuts that I feel so sluggish and tired all the time, I literally feel like I could just fall asleep all day! My brain feels like it has been numbed and I'm struggling to find any focus or energy at all. 

I'm so tempted to drink a coke to feel normal although I'm not actually craving one physically which is good. I am eating very healthy (my main meals always were healthy and my snacking was my main issue). My calories are fine about 1800 - 2000 a day which is enough for me. 

I am drinking water, green tea, healthy snacks, I am sleeping well at night but I feel like a zombie!

It seems clear to me that I was self medicating with cola etc to wake myself up and now I've stopped I have some other issues I need to deal with!

Any ideas on how to feel better?  

Note: I am vegetarian and I really hate coffee!"
"Lost 40lbs, Still Over 400 And Stalled Weight. Looking for advice I'm getting a bit frustrated because I'm not sure exactly what to do. 

I started off at 440lbs in January and finally decided enough was enough and started cooking more at home, Tracking my calories and started moving more. The weight loss was amazing at first and then I stalled about 20 pounds it and that lasted 3-4 days then I started to lose again and now I'm stalled again and the scale hasn't budged for almost two weeks. 

I've been tracking my calories on myfitnesspal and tracking my steps. I've been very strict consuming 1400-1800 calories, I don't cook with oils or butters, drink soda and haven't had any fast food in six weeks ect.. and walking 1-2 miles every day but every time i get on the scale the next morning my weight is exactly the same.

"Down 30 lbs in a year! It was a bumpy ride, folks. I started in March 2020. Highest: 81.5kg/180 lbs. Current: 68kg/150 lbs. Height: 169cm/5'6""

Firstly, I gave myself 7 months to lose 13.5kg/30 lbs. I failed at that. I managed to lose 9.5kg/20lbs. I was lifting, running, biking and generally getting stronger, which felt successful. The pounds just weren't peeling off the way I had thought they would. Maybe I was more tired after baby #2. Maybe turning 43 and metabolism changes had something to do with it. Maybe I wasn't trying hard enough, or could have been more restrictive with my diet. Maybe it was autoimmune exhaustion (Crohn's disease). Probably all combined contributed to sluggish weight loss. 

So by that 7 month marker I had given myself, I had lost 9.5kg/20 lbs and gained a LOT of strength. I was pretty pleased, despite not making my goal. I kept at it. 

Then came a 6 week course of prednisone to help my Crohn's. I gained 5kg/10 lbs in under 2 weeks. That shocked me, and I was very careful about what I ate after that. I didn't gain any more. 

Them came winter. Slippery sidewalks, darkness, lots of snow, cold weather. Our home gym is in an unheated garage. I stopped working out. Started restricting calories for a nice, slow loss of about a pound a week. Went plant-based until my Crohn's complained. I'm still figuring that out. 

But now it's almost Spring. Sticking to it through the year despite setbacks has worked out. I changed my plan as circumstances dictated, and kept going. Stayed positive. I still have another 5 lbs of muscle to gain and another 5 of fat to lose, but I can just chip away at that as well. Who knows? I might not be satisfied with 5 more lbs of muscle. I might want to keep lifting and growing and become a beast. And to anyone out there chipping away at their fitness and body, remember that determination and dedication count for more than motivation. Just keep going."

______________________________________________________

Hi guys,

This is my first post here, but I do follow and read other people’s posts for insight. So I started out at about 200 lbs. back in September 2019. Much of the weight started falling off once my IUD expired and my appetite started to settle down, and now (Mar 2021) I weigh about 147 lbs, but has slowed down a lot now that I am smaller. I am almost to my weight from high school, which is cool I guess.

But honestly, I like how I look. I am losing weight slowly, but surely. I got to my goal size (a medium or 8/10 US size). I'm 
still a bit soft so I am working on lifting when I go to the gym now in addition to my normal 30m-1hr of cardio. Perhaps I need to work on body recomposition instead?

However, according to my smart scale, my BMI is about 26. Overweight by a few points. 

BMI calculators say my weight range is supposed to between 115-126. My vitals are fine, and I have always had normal blood pressure, even at my largest. My doctor has not mentioned any problems nor has he brought up any concerns. 

I guess what I am feeling conflicted about is whether or not I should keep going. I don’t really *want* to have to keep eating 1300 cals. But I almost feel guilty when I eat at maintenance. Like I’ve ruined something that's been in progress for so long. 

Also, truth be told, I really don't feel like buying new clothes lol. But I keep wondering, am I too fat? Do I need to keep going?"
"Wecipe Wednesday - March 3, 2021 - Roasts! Welcome back to Wecipe Wednesday. I volunteered to lead a return of this longstanding regular thread at [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) at least until the end of March 2021.

I have selected 13 meals or dishes that I keep making over and over that should be compatible with most diets. I'll include the ingredients list, nutritional information along with other hints. Some recipes are vegetarian/vegan, others not so much.

Post your favourite healthy recipes here to share with the rest of the loseit community! Recipes don't have to fit this week's theme at all, they should just be something that you can eat reasonably frequently while actively losing weight.

Due to the spirit of the sub, please try to include the calorie and nutritional information if at all possible. MyFitnessPal has awesome recipe calculators you can use!

For the most part, I target my meals to have a component in the 350-550 kcal range. My lunch and dinner tend to be right around 400 kcal each and dinner can be a bit heavier, or include a side dish to bring the calories up a bit. When I was eating 1650 kcal/day the breakdown was roughly 400/400/600/250 for breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks.

Anyhow: enough background on to the recipes!

**Roasts**

Pork Tenderloin is something I tend to cook once every two weeks or so. It's a relatively lean cut of meat and generally comes in 1-1.5 lb portions and at 150 kcal/3 oz portion each whole 20 oz tenderloin is about 1,000 kcal.

During the warmer months I'll do it on the grill and serve with a salad, but in the winter months I will usually roast it in the oven and also make some roast potatoes and Brussels sprouts. 

Here's a single sheet pan recipe to get them all done in around the same time about 20-25 minutes in the oven. https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/sheet-pan-pork-tenderloin-and-potatoes/

Note that I scaled down the portions to what I usually use and mixed the sprouts in with the potatoes.

Pork
- 1.25 lbs pork tenderloin [1000 kcal]
- 1/4 cup brown sugar [200 kcal]
- 2 tsp garlic 
- 2 tbsp reduced sodium soy sauce
- 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 1/4 tsp smoked paprika optional

Potatoes and Sprouts
- 0.5 lbs baby red and/or gold potatoes, halved [180 kcal]
- 1 tbsp olive oil [180 kcal]
- 1 oz grated parmesan cheese [120 kcal]
- 0.5 lbs brussels sprouts [100 kcal]
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 tsp Italian blend herbs
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder

All in this is a 450 kcal [29/17/44 g carbs/fat/protein] meal if you make this four portions. My partner and I will usually cut half of the tenderloin and put away half of the sides for another day once it's all cooked. It reheats better if the meat is not pre-sliced and it's dinner for another day. 

You can easily scale up the vegetables if you want more volume or are targeting higher calorie levels. Doubling the potatoes and sprouts adds another ~250 kcal. I also don't mind adding something like some simple steamed broccoli or green beans to the mix or a green salad. 

What are you cooking?"
"My GF decided to start losing weight, what is this the economically best way to do that? She has gained about 30 pounds (15kg) since she moved out from her parents home last year.

We're both students and have a limited economy (although I got a side job to help her out if needed). She has thought about LCHF, but she still got potatoes and pasta left to eat, which she doesn't really want to throw away.

Truthfully and ironically, she doesn't really want to change her diet or go to training, but she knows she needs to do that. I'm willing to help her out in any way possible if needed and I will support her all the way, but I dont want to be a pushover.

So, what is the best way to lose weight economically?


TL;DR: She's 5'3 (160cm) and currently 160 lbs (70+kg) and wants to get back to her normal weight of 125 lbs (55+kg) in the most economically way possible."
"How can I help my Girlfriend? Me and the love of my life are doing our best to lose weight. Everyone goes at their own pace and I know weight loss can be much harder for females. We are pursuing goals we have made and weight loss is number 1. I’m down 30 lbs and her about 5 lbs. 

By no means am I requiring her to lose weight and I’m going to love her no matter what. We have gotten into a great habit of using our treadmill and are seeing benefits. However she is frustrated at my speed of lost weight compared to hers. I am intermittent fasting and doing keto. She is doing CICO only. Keto does not work for her because of dairy reasons and she repeatedly says there is no way she can do intermittent fasting.  I’m not gonna force anything on her but am wondering if anyone can suggest something that might be able to
Kick start her? Of course this all hinges on her willingness. Once again nothing is wrong with her CICO method and slowly going at her own pace and I am supporting the hell out of that. 

I’m just looking for suggestions of extra stuff I can do to help her. Maybe ideas of what else she can try? Ways that we can close the gap. Any fellow females have suggestions on how to transition into IF? Groundbreaking habits that really helped kick off weight loss? 

And once again I reiterate, her doing CICO and going her own pace is completely fine. Maybe the only suggestions will be to keep supporting her. That goes without saying. If you couldn’t tell I don’t want to come off as the ass hole BF requiring her to lose weight or pushing her to do things she doesn’t want to. Weight loss is friggin hard. I get that.  I am just looking for suggestions and experience of others in what finally helped them go to the next level in weight loss. 

Thank you in advance."
"Losing motivation on week 4. | Changing to a healthier diet. I started lacking motivation to workout this week. I think it’s mostly energy based. I was super motivated last week. This always happens, Usually on the second or third week so I’m surprised I lasted this long. But I refuse to give up after working so hard.

I gained back 10 lbs after not eating so well while working out. I believe I gained muscle since my arm fat has shrunk by a lot, I was surprised at that too. It only took three weeks! Imagine how much smaller it will be in six weeks. I can’t wait.

Back in January my waist/hips and even legs looked super skinny. Now that I gained 10 lbs I always look bloated again. I hope by drinking more smoothies and slim fast will shred off the pounds quickly but it’s already been stuck at 275 for a week now. Once I started to try and lose weight that’s when I gained it, But when I don’t even try I lose more! It’s so annoying. I did my grocery shopping yesterday and only got healthy things to meal prep, Including healthy meals for breakfast. I’m on like day 3 of no coffee at home and only got Dunkin once the other day. Haven’t had the energy to make it but I will today since I need the energy. I picked up two flavors of energy drinks, Those tiny pocket sized ones so I hope they will help too. I just don’t want to quit due to lack of energy and motivation. I’ve been trying to go every day straight (4-5 days a week) so maybe that’s why I’m so tired?? I can’t just skip a day but yesterday I only did 15 Minutes on the bike so I wouldn’t feel too burnt out today. I used to go for daily walks but it was hard in the winter, Now the sun is coming out more so I have no excuse! I will start by going for walks 4 days a week/on active rest days. I really need to keep my body moving. Last year I was dangerously low on vitamin d for being inside all day. But now I’m going out more often so I hope it will get better soon. 

For my meal prep this week I got:

Breakfast: (Varies)
French toast.
Whole toast with yogurt/fruit or peanut butter, Eggs and avocado.
Oatmeal with fruit or peanut butter.
English muffin with cream cheese.
Homemade Smoothies.

Lunch:
Gardein vegan burgers, With vegan chicken tenders.
Or leftover meal prep.

Snacks: 
Colby jack string cheese.
Yogurt with fruit.

Dinner:
Frozen peppers.
California vegetable blend.
Sweet potatoes.

Does this meal plan seem good enough to lose weight?? I’m pretty picky and trying to eat less meat/rarely eat chicken."
"Same weight what's happening? Hi
Back story.  In my final year of high school at the beginning of 2019 I was 290 pounds I started doing mostly strength training not too much cardio about 10 minutes 3 times a week for about 10 months. I was trying a protein based diet but I didn't have the money to hit 200+g of protein per day often it would be about a 100g.I was seeing results I got down to 238 pounds.

I'm now 2nd year college student.
Since the pandemic start with gyms being closed and school I'm now back to 290 pounds.

With alot more money now than before I thought I can eat healthier get some supplements and hit those 200+g of protein, go to the gym workout harder, track the calories and I'll see results at a faster pace than before.
I've been working out for about 2 months now lifting heavier, doing more sets, 40 minutes cardio 3 times a week.
And I'm still the same weight.
I don't know what's going on. Am I gaining muscle and losing fat at the same rate?( Which should be impossible).
Any advice?
I'm trying to lose the fat and build muscle."
"Bulking/cutting with loose skin after a lot of weight loss: what method do you guys prefer? So I'm a 5'10 guy, I used to weigh around 260lbs, but over the last few years have dropped down to 155lbs, however for about the last 6 months I've barely made any progress in terms of building muscle (I don't have much muscle) or losing any of the fat I have left, because I simply can't decide whether to cut or bulk. I want to gain muscle, but I have either some fat/loose skin around my chest and stomach, I just can't work it which one it is. It hangs (in my opinion) like loose skin when I bend over, but doesn't look very bad when I'm standing straight, unless I'm bloated. I can't decide whether I should cut more, as I already look quite skinny and I don't have a lot of muscle, or start lean bulking and hope I can put some muscle on and look a bit better. Does anyone have any personal experiences they can share? Or even any advice they could share? Thanks everyone!"
"Hi, I(19f) feel at a loss, and i dont know what to do Hi y'all I don't know what to do... I don't want anyone to be triggered or anything so I want to say that its not a whoh Ive achived something post, but rather a kind of ""Hi I need advice"" post.

Im 19yo and Im 174cm (5'7?) and I weigh 102kg (224lbs) and Im at the point of where I hate how I look and ive gone to the gym for a year without results. I know its because of my eating habits, but i just dont seem to be able to be headstrong enough to keep my habits healthy... I go to the gym 3-5 times a week and ill be there for 1-2h and be happy and i feel strong, but I have so much fat on my body and I feel so bad in my own body. But when I try my best I'll break my habits when im with my friends or if im feeling a bit hungry. I dont know how I can make it better, i feel like im just in a constant battle where Im not strong enough to say no to candy or that I dont want to go to the gym.

Im also a student who isnt really at school alot, we have classes 3 times a week and Im not that busy so I can get cravings often because lack of things to do. I feel so urgh because I want to see results, and I miss being at a ""healthy"" weight (stuggled with morbus chrons so it wasnt really healthy, but i felt so much better loosing all that weight i had gained bc of medications).

I know my life would be so much easier if i was healthier, but i dont know how to stay on track and be healthier. Especially when I got unhealthy friends... I dunno, I just look at myself and see so much wrong. I love myself, but its still hard to feel comfortable since I can remember the feeling of being light and not being worried over my weight.

As well as I cant eat carrots, nuts or anything that cant be processed since Ill end up at the emergency room if so, last time i ate 3 carrots i ended up almost going bc it was so painful and couldnt sleep for the night

Any advice or anything would help... :( I just feel so down rn

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: the reason I cant eat nuts and carrots and food like that is because of my stoma, forgot to mention that"
"One year of IF (1230-830) and working out consistently I definitely look and feel healthier which is great. I also don’t eat like crap like I used too and try to have more healthier options. I’ll have occasional ice cream or chips.  

I stepped on the scale and I still weigh the same as before I started getting into IF and working out more. 

My workout due to covid has been more cardio and body weight HIIT.   

I know muscle weighs more then fat, and I’m not discrediting the workouts I am doing cuz I haven’t lost weight. Just want to know why im still the same weight? I figured I would drop atleast 10lbs.   Any insights would be appreciated! I really don’t want to start counting calories."
"Did I ruin my metabolism? Hi guys, thought I'd post here and get some opinions. 

F(38) 5'2"", SW(183), CW(162), GW (125).  I've been eating low carb and calorie counting since December 2020. I had lost 20lbs as of early February. My daily calorie intake was between 1200-1300 and I went to the gym a few times a week and walked briskly on the treadmill/elliptical. I started reading about intermittent fasting and then water fasting (not promoting here!) and thought I'd give it a try to maybe speed my weight loss along. 

I ended up eating way too few calories (like 500) for about a week, then I fasted for four days. This is NOT my usual approach and I felt unhealthy doing it, but I wanted to try it for myself and see what it was like. That's a whole other post...

Not surprisingly I did lose more weight, got down to 158 lbs, but of course my body wasn't happy and I overate the next three days. I say overate, however I'm positive (as I've been tracking calories for months now tracked these) that those calories didn't remotely add up to the calories I didn't eat for that two week period of super low calorie/fasting. 

Okay, now to my question. I'm back to my 1200-1300 calories/day, normal low-carb whole foods that I was doing. But now this seems to be making me gain weight, as I'm back up to 162. Do you guys think my body is just evening out again after all the fluctuation? Or did I mess up my metabolism and now to start losing again I need to eat less or more? I've read so much conflicting 'science' and I just want to get back to a slow, steady, healthy weight loss pattern. Thanks so much!"
"Office treats for co-worker trying to lose weight With the one year anniversary of covid-induced working from home approaching, I am putting together a gift basket for my team members to ""celebrate"" the milestone. Like most offices, we used to have treats in the breakroom nearly every day so I was going to send everyone a box of donuts with a note that says though we've missed a lot of break room treats, I've missed them even more than I've missed free donuts in the breakroom.  However, I have one teammate who is actively trying to lose weight and has lost 25 lbs so far. I want to support her and obviously don't think sending a box of donuts would be a good way to do that. We never really had healthy snacks in the breakroom, but I was thinking of sending her fruit anyway. My biggest concern is that she will find out that others got donuts and she got fruit and will feel bad, even though I'm trying to do something supportive. Anyone have any ideas for how to do this without hurting or sabotaging her?"
"Flabby soft body yet not overweight/haven't lost weight recently Hi everyone.

I have a BMI of 20,4 (170cm, 59 kg) which theoretically would mean my weight is okay  but i am super fat! 

My flesh is flabby, moves like a jelly when i walk, my feet are swollen and the socks leave marks and sink in my fatty leg. Bracelets leave marks. I'm just so soft and fat. I'm disgusted every time i look at my body when i change my clothes/take a shower. I have cellulite everywhere except for my belly which is slim.

Why am i like this? I am planning to slim down to 52 kg anyway, as i have been there in the past and loved my looks. But still, it seems so weird to me that i have a low BMI yet the body of an obese person in terms of texture/flabbiness/softness."
"Kalories tracking app that can deal with small portions from big recipes? One thing I often do when I'm serious about losing weight is cooking a big pot of something healthy and then eating it over the course of 2-3 days.

I'm currently using FatSecret for tracking calories and while they do have the option to save a recipe it's a recipe for one portion. So either I have to eat exactly the same portion size every time or I have to re-do the recipe every time. When it's something complex with lots of ingredients this obviously explodes the effort required to track my calories so it's quite annoying.

Is there an app that accepts like a full recipe and allows you to track fractions of it?"
"Avoiding stress eating? F29, 5’0, SW 168, CW 160, GW 126

Life has recently got a bit stressful for me. My job is super busy at the moment as two of our managers have been off long-term with Covid issues, so it feels like my inbox is filling up faster than I can empty it and I’m working overtime to deal with everything. I’m also moving in just over two weeks and trying to organise everything is taking up all my spare time and mental capacity. I have an anxiety disorder and I’m not sleeping properly due to the stress.

Normally I’d grab some chocolate to give me a boost. But I’m 8lbs down since January and don’t want to let it all go to waste - I feel right now that having a small piece of chocolate would open the floodgates and I wouldn’t be able to control myself! Does anyone have any tips for getting through the stress period relatively healthily?

I drink plenty of water and try to stick to under 1400 cals a day, not sure if that helps. I guess I’m hoping for lifestyle or mental tips rather than dietary, but I’ll take anything!"
"[Update] I am feeling better! Following my last post, I must say that I now have lost 6 kg already, and I keep going. I have now a complete diagnosis and I strangely feel relieved although it's much more serious; apparently, I don't have Fatty liver (as I was mistakenly diagnosed last year), but Autoimmune Hepatitis, which caused me diabetes. Is it bizarre that I feel more relieved now that I have a totally different diagnosis? I don't know, it may have lifted the weight of having such problems due to my own choices. Nevertheless, I keep my healthy diet and I continue walking around 2-3 kilometers a day. Although I have still a long way until my goal, I feel healthier, and my clothes fit me again. It's not much, but now I have to fight for something even greater, and I put all of my energy into being healthy again."
"Morbidly obese 21yr old hello, I’m 21 and weigh around 350 and I’m 5’6 
I think my obesity comes from eating way to much,  salty / deep fried foods such as chicken nuggets French fries pizza etc (what my diet has consisted of for the past 10+ years 
I have high blood pressure that’s for sure probably diabetes as well but haven’t wanted to get my blood drawn to find out the answer as it scares me. I’ve seen a ton of changes in my body in the past year, I’ve become realky out of shape, walking up the stairs makes me run out of breath:/ I have extreme anxiety and being so big doesn’t help my case what so ever. I have a well paying job and don’t need to worry about my career, I am loved by so many people around me, very loved.  I am very close to being a stud this is my last chapter, I need to lose this weight!!! It will help me be so much better, do the things i would love to do. 
My problem is I have a hard time getting to the gym, staying, I’ve tried plenty of dieting and it won’t work for me. As I always find my self ordering fast food for 3 meals. I am always thinking about food and just eating a lot of it and it messes with aspects of my life cuz I won’t do something without a bloated stomach. I ride the food high so hard, I completely abuse fast food. I tried to fast but couldn’t fit to long cuz I become sick. I don’t know how to find what will work for me, my health is a big concern I would like to live past 30 /40 yrs old but at this rate... I won’t make it very far.  I do have some trauma from when I was a kid. As I don’t think it has anything to do with my strong food addiction. Some people do say that stuff can’t hurt, 
My question is how do I start with eating better and not being so picky?! and not always wanting fast food all day everyday 
today I was on my longboard for 2 hours and broke mad sweat. I’m gonna do it again tomorrow. thanks for any sort of help on this post! I don’t usually do this but I am kinda trying to change."
"2 months of maintenance We're we are again... another month of weight maintenance. This was an interesting one.

The first half of this month I was still tracking my weight but these last two weeks I took a totally hands off approach, so no weigh ins or calorie tracking since I went on vacation. I also ate whatever I wanted. I gained 0.3 kg during this maintenance month, so I consider it a success. What could have gone better was working out, since I basically stopped working out this last month.

I know I said that I was going to do another month of maintenance but I decided to take another fat loss phase. This one is going to be shorter than the one before. It's going to be a 24 week phase (4 weeks of fat loss + 1 week diet break + 4 weeks of fat loss + 1 week diet break + 4 weeks of fat loss + 9 week reverse diet until maintenance calories). I expect to lose around 9% of my total weight and finally get into the ""healthy"" BMI range. Another goal is to hit the a normalised FFMI of 20 but I don't know if that's too easy or too hard of a goal.

At the end of this phase I will be at a great healthy point that can then serve me to decide what I want to do in the future."
"Eat more when thinking of weight loss? Hello everyone, in the past people have been so supportive here and i just wanted to see if other people are struggling with what I am or have in the past? Weight loss is on my mind a lot of the time, I'm currently quite big and uncomfortable with my size, before lockdown I lost some weight as I was on my feet more but this last lockdown I've pounded it on. The more I think about loosing weight I for some reason eat more than I know I actually want. I have 0 self control right now and really could do with some useful tips to change my mind set again to actually be acting upon it and improving my health.  I was jogging (on the spot) and working out half an hour to an hour a day on top of work just doing mild things finishing with yoga, I even got myself a yoga mat and sponges etc that i was so happy about! this was only 4 months ago and now I feel disappointed in myself for stopping and can't find the motivation to pick it back up again."
"One month of diet and exercise, no weight loss! (details included) I am seriously perplexed.

I have succesfully lost weight in the past (8kg), previously entireley from diet changes, this time i did what i normally do plus  some exercise and no weight OR inches lost (clothes are not getting looser!)

I have been following the chloe ting workouts (finished the 'Get Fit Challenge' and half way through the '4 week summer shred'), and have seen strength/stamina improvements.

But weight wise, ive weighed the same over these past 30 days (weighing myself every 3 days at same time in the moning) Previously in this time period i would have seen at least a 2kg loss (with water weight flucatuations).

&amp;#x200B;

I eat around 1450 calories per day (+-100) regardless on the excersie that day. **I weigh my food**, have cut out sugar and heres what a typical day of food is:

Breakfast:

no-sugar museli w/ nuts and oat milk

Lunch:

veggie sausages/breaded fish, and stir fried veg

Dinner:

Beyond meat burger and salad (no dressing)/raw veg, and some fruit (melon, pinapple, strawberries etc)

Snack:

peanut butter / matcha latte + (drinking a pot of green tea a day and water)

&amp;#x200B;

When i previously lost weight, i was eating similarly, but with no execrise and around 1300 calories a day, what could be happening?!

Should I consider dropping my calories lower to 1300 again?

"Joining slimming world Hi Everyone. So I am 5'1 and 196lb. I need to lose 50lb but I am struggling to get the motivation and commitment to do it. I start strong and lose a few pounds and then bail on it. It could start with going over calories by a few hundred or if my partner suggests takeaway then I jump on the bandwagon. Sometimes it's just a full out screw it and drive to a McDonald's takeaway... you can imagine what happens from there. I get so frustrated with myself. I hate how I look at the moment. I take no care or pride in my appearance whatsoever. I have been with my partner for 6 years now and I just cannot continue like this anymore. I do drastic things in a hope they spur me on to succeed and they never do. Currently I have a weightloss bet I put down 50 a month to get 2k back for October (currently losing), I signed up to become a personal trainer (I really do love powerlifting) but feel like such an idiot I can't even look at the material and I I signed up to walk 13 miles trek up the Brecon Beacons in the UK. Nothing spurs me on. I have yo-yo between calories, slimming world, weight watchers, tried noom. God everything. I know it is me that has to change but I just don't know what to do anymore."
"I’m 13, I need motivation. Help. I ruined my sleep pattern after fasting and getting fit and I’ve slipped back to treats because my mum won’t stop buying them in so “you have something to eat” I can’t overcome the want to eat so I’ve ended up having rainbow drops, 2 small crunchies, 6 Oreo bites, hot chocolate and a curry. Now I can’t eat tonight because I’m within my calories. I also suffer with OCD so it’s telling me that I’m never gonna lose it. Please, help. I’m hardly building up the strength to go on a walk today, I’m extremely hungry right now and since it’s past midnight my mum will say “it’s a new day, new calories” she understands what this means to me but she says that and keeps buying in treats. Please, please tell me I’ll lose it. I feel hopeless. I feel like I’m going to get fatter. I lost 14 pounds in 1 month but I’m really slipping. Help, help me please. I’m gaining it all back. I’ve got no motivation. I try to not eat for the rest of the day but then my mum says it’s like bulimia or anorexia and bordering on an eating disorder. I tell her to stop buying treats for me and she says “well it’s your fault you’re eating them, you don’t have to” I beg her to not and she says “ok I won’t buy stuff anymore” then the next day she buys more. Please just help. I need motivation. I’m on the brink of quitting."
"Wicked low calories but such slow weight loss. What is going on? Hello, I have question about my cut, which I started 5 weeks ago and is going painfully slow despite 2,100 calories a day.

I am 38 years old, 5'10"" (178 cm), workout out six times a week.

I started 5 weeks ago at 188 lb. (85.2 kg) with about 17-20% bodyfat. I started at 2,500 cal/day but was making slow progress, losing only about 0.5 lb (0.22 kg) a week. So, I gradually lowered each week and I am currently at 2,100 calories a day but still only losing 0.5 to 0.7 lb (0.3 kg) a week.

I've heard that 1.0 to 1.5 lb (0.45 to 0.68 kg) a week is a good rate of weight loss but I have not even been able to break 1.0 lb lost a week yet.

I work out six times a week. 3 sessions of full body weight lifting, 2 sessions of high intensity cardio (boxing, hill sprints etc.), and 1 slow steady state cardio session for about an hour. So, my work rate is high.

Is 2,100 calories too low for someone at my age, height/weight, and activity level? It seems really low to me. Yet, I am able to complete my hard works outs. I am still gaining strength in the gym. I do not feel week or wasted. I only have minor to moderate hunger at night, sometimes none at all.

However, I don't want to cut forever and this progress seems painfully slow.

One possible explanation is that my body is going under a recomp. I do seem more defined and a bit bigger in the mirror, but not that much (could be my mind playing tricks on me). My strength continues to go up in the gym. I am an experienced athlete, but in terms of weight lifting I am definitely deconditioned. Plus, even at my best, my lifts never went past ""intermediate"" numbers. So, I guess it might be possible.

That being said, my goal is to cut fat to about 12% bodyfat and then start a dedicated lean bulk. Not necessarily to recomp."
"I am never recommending sugar-free gum to anyone again! A while ago, I decided to start chewing sugar-free gum to keep my mouth occupied when I wanted to snack out of boredom. Plus, xylitol is good for your teeth. Seemed like a win-win.

TMI...

I've noticed an increasing occurrence of gut issues, mainly bloating. And I don't mean that as a code word for looking fat, I mean ***pain***, to where the only relief is either lying flat or bending over (presumably for the way those positions move things around in there) while waiting for gas tabs to kick in. I had thought that it might be a symptom of too high fiber, despite having the same foods for months without issue and was set to give up favorites like oatmeal, chia, flax.

Tonight, I had the same issues, no oats, chia, or flax in sight, plenty of water all day long, with some gum earlier in the day. I'm not sure why it suddenly occurred to me it might be the gum, but I looked up the ingredients and apparently artificial sugar alcohols can cause these issues in some people. 

Now, I can't say with 100% certainty, of course. I'm not going to run a randomized control trial, but I think it's likely. 

I'll add that, before chewing this gum, I've never been one to consume stuff with artificial sugar and have actively avoided it, so it's not something my body is accustomed to dealing with.

I hope my bacteria friends aren't too pissed at me and will return to normal eventually. &gt;.&lt;"
"Week 6 weigh in Hey 

I 25f 5ft 3inches SW 237.6 CG 185 just weighed in at 226lbs . Yes its only 0.8lbs.


 But my excuse is last weekend i ate within my calories a take out which made it into two meals . It was fried and high in salt . Also last week we had bad weather so for safety reasons couldnt walk dogs as much .


Overall im still proud as i still lost weight and all i aim for is 1lb a week so i was close .


Im still doing at home workouts three times a week still dont like it when will i like exercise???



Apart from said takeaway iv really limited my salt i still do use salted butter as SO prefers it plus i only use a tiny amount . 



Since starting 6weeks ago as well as drinking just water and lots of it . Iv been trying to eat slower which is a huge help .


Im trying to think of some small goals for march but im a bit stumped atm . 

One thing i am going to do is slowly buy new clothes that when i lose weight i wont mind being baggy . As i want cute clothes now not later .

"I went from 130 to 190 in 6 months at 5'7"" I'm finally at a healthy weight and idk who else to tell! I'm just really happy with where my body is for the first time in well forever. I was always extremely thin and ppl would call me holocaust survivor or skeletor in high-school and it made me so insecure. I ate, a lot in fact but just couldn't put on weight. Then I met my future husband, hit 29 and put on 60 pounds in about 6 months to a year. It was so bad his grandfather asked if I was pregnant at Christmas and again at his grandmother's funeral. I was mortified, I'd never been comfortable in my body but being heavier was even worse. I stopped caring about what I looked like, wore, stopped getting my hair done etc. My fiance still loved me and was wonderful but I felt so disgusting. I started drinking....a lot. Like a bottle of Amsterdam vodka in 2 days to my self or a whole 12 pack of seltzers. Then I got sick, I couldn't eat anything heavy or drink without vomiting...drs did so many tests and couldn't figure it out. Turned out I had an infected cyst on my ovary leaking bacteria into my abdomen that my stomach was absorbing making me sick. I quit drinking everyday, quit smoking the first time I was admitted to hospital and changed my eating habits/diet and now I've lost 30lbs and losing about 6lbs every 3 months. My goal weight is 150, I'm 163 right now and so proud of myself for the changes I've made. Noone in my life seems to care, they all want to make comments about my weight when I was heavier but now...nothing. So just wanted to share I'm proud of myself for quitting smoking cigs, binge drinking and eating until I passed out. I dyed my hair this week and bought new clothes. Went bridesmaid dress shopping and didn't loathe it like I did months before. I guess I'm just happy and finally feel sexy/happy with my figure and weight. If I can do it anyone can, thanks for being inspiration! That's all, thanks for reading."

"Scales going back up but still look like I’m losing? Feeling confused and demoralised I’m female (37) starting weight was 180lbs, goal weight 150 lbs, current weight 169 lbs. 

Im eating healthy, walking 10k steps a day, and lifting weights. But a few things are confusing me. 

I use a couple of apps to log my weight and it shows me how many more lbs I can lose at the rate I’m going by certain dates. It’s been really motivating me but recently the scales are going back up even though my progress pics and clothes indicate I’m still losing weight. 

I also look trimmer all over and more proportional than I did when I weight 160lbs (before putting more weight on and starting my weight loss programme). 

It’s all confusing me and not being able to see the scales going down is actually demoralising me. Any thoughts?"

""I must be eating like crazy"", I think, then go over the meals I had and realize that maybe I had 1000-1500 calories extra over the weekend which can't possibly account for a 3-4kg gain. 

My head is 30% occupied with work, 20% with life, and then 50% of my thoughts are around weight loss. The frustrating thing is that it doesn't pay off."
"weight fluctuation anyone? I'm not sure if negative non-progress posts are allowed here but here goes. 

My weight fluctuates a lot in a year, and I end up somewhere between losing and gaining 15-30 pounds. I've noticed that my behaviour and personality tend to change a lot depending on where I am on my weight loss journey - when I'm at my lowest, I'm a social butterfly and love hanging out with people. When I start to gain weight, however, I cut myself off from everyone and stay holed up in my room because I'm scared of getting judged. I've gained some weight recently and I am completely unable to go outside at all or talk to people - I feel too self-conscious so I've been cancelling all my plans that involved going outside. I can't even go to the convenience store anymore. I know this might sound extreme but I was wondering if anyone's been going through the same thing as me."
"I got diagnosed with - Pre diabetes !! Help please :/ I’m freaking out. I am 23 year old 5’7 and 270-280 pounds. I don’t even feel bad nor did i ever experience any kind of pain that prompted me to go visit the doctor. I only went to the doctor to get a physical done for my job. However, come to my surprise i am pre-diabetic. I am wondering how i should go about this?? I’m starting to workout 1-1:30 hrs a day. Keeping track of my food. My doctor recommended that i start losing weight by exercising, cut red meat, minimal carbs, drink lots of water, and NO SWEETS/Sugar. I requested to see a nutritionist to talk about a meal plan but i have crappy insurance(medical) and who knows how long it will take before i can see one. 


Hence i have come to reddit to see what i can do about it? I’m thinking of going on a full keto diet. Just stick to white meat like chicken, turkey, fish etc. And really try hard on cutting down on carbs and sweets. Has anyone here successfully gotten out of pre-diabetes stage? if so how??"
"I’ve been eating clean for about three months but today I ate a chocolate muffin and I instantly felt horridly sick, why? (For reference I’m 16, 156cm/5’1”, 52.5kg/115lbs. My starting weight was 60kg/132lbs, and I eat around 1100-1300 cals a day, and burn 200-400)

so I’ve been eating a clean, vegetarian diet for the past couple of months. It would be a completely vegan diet if it weren’t for the occasional boiled egg I eat and the fact that I’m obsessed with cottage cheese. Any who, I ate a chocolate muffin and within about three minutes my heart rate started picking up and I got kinda shaky, then the nausea and stomach cramps set in. I feel really clogged up and I hate how the fat, sugar, and oil is just sitting in my stomach and I can’t do anything about it. 

I know there wasn’t anything spoilt in the muffins as I made them myself and nothing was off in the ingredients, and there wasn’t any milk in it that would’ve made me sick (I’m lactose intolerant). 

I’m just wondering why this is? I’ve felt dizzy and nauseous after eating certain things before, but I’ve noticed now that the longer I have gone eating healthy, the more frequent I have started to feel sick from unhealthy food. It first started with really really unhealthy food- like fried chips, but now it’s crept up on things like pasta, or even marinated tofu (although plain tofu is okay).  

I’m really thinking of converting to a raw vegan diet, as eating the foods that fall into that category are the only things that agree with my stomach and don’t leave me clogged up, shaky, and sick. 

I guess I just hate how my stomach can pick up every ounce of oil and fat that reaches it now. It’s like I don’t even have to read the nutritional labels of food anymore to see if there’s saturated/trans fatty acids in it— I can just tell by how disgusting and greasy my stomach feels. 

Has anyone ever experienced this before? Is there a gastrointestinal issue I’ve developed to explain this digestion problem? Will a supplement be able to fix this? 

Thank you heaps! :)"
"I can't get rid of feeling I am doing something meaningless 6' 17M CW: 250 GW: 180

I have above average amount of excess fat since my kindergarten days. I had no control of what I was eating, and even had no clue what my problem with health is. That obscurity ended at my age of 14. I was desperate about it and just accepting it with shame for three years. Now, at the age of 17, I've just started to gather any sort of weightloss information. So I figured out my basal metabolic rate, started counting calories, started doing a little bit of exercises everyday. And I have feeling that I do exercises wrong. Every morning I do exercises on my stationary bike. But only for 20-25 minutes. I heard that you have to do cardio for like one hour to have atleast tiny weightloss progress, but even 25 minutes are enough to make me extremely sweaty like never before (like you doused yourself from water bottle) and make me exhausted for 4-5 hours. Even 10 minutes are enough to make me feel uncomfortable but I don't give up until it gives me a pain in my legs. I usually ride near 5.5 miles. I heard from my friends that they ride like 12-14 miles per day at summertime on their own bicycles. And I am now thinking that I workout for nothing. Those exercises make me really exhausted but, as I think, they get me nothing. I think those 25 minutes aren't enoguh to start burning fat to get energy. Maybe it sounds wild to you but I think like that. Anyway, I have done my cardio for today and now I am writing this post to maybe get some advices and help. Please, help me, I am stuck with my thoughts."
"Goal Weight Reached Sooner Than Expected! How to Maintain? So, I (F, 29, SW: 158lb, CW: 135lb, GW: 134lb) am about a pound away from my (new) goal weight, yay! 

My weight loss has mostly been for our wedding in August, and while I'm at the maximum weight I want to be on the day itself, I would like to lose one more pound to allow for birthday celebrations and our wedding cake tasting in April. I've also got two hen do's and potentially another wedding between now and late August; that's a lot of cake and prosecco.

My question is, once I've binned this last pound, how do I maintain? I've heard it's harder to maintain than lose, and I'm conscious that April in particular will be heavier than most other months (it's my Mam's 60th and my 30th the first two weekends; our cake tasting the week after mine; and I don't know what the last weekend will look like yet). I've changed my stats on MyFitnessPal and upped my points on WW, but I don't want to lose everything I've worked hard for over the last year. Any tips are greatly appreciated :)"
"Is it too late? (a sad rant to be taken with a margarita rim’s worth of salt) Hi guys. Hear me out- I know everything I’m about to say is illogical, but I need to just express my feelings and (hopefully) get some advice/encouragement that will help me shake this feeling. Obligatory “I’m on mobile” disclaimer.

I’m 26f, 235lbs, at only 5’2”. I don’t usually feel huge unless I need to bend down (squat, kneel) or I see myself in a picture or video (who is THAT?!?!?). I know for the sake of my health, I need to lose weight. For the sake of my health and vanity, I WANT to lose weight. 

However... I tend to give up on myself. I’m very all-or-nothing about it, and I also sometimes feel like it’s too late for me. That I missed the window where change was possible. Since I’ll never be 18 or 21 again, what’s the point? I missed my peak years. Why try when I’ve already lost so much time? What if my bad habits have already done irreparable harm to my health? If I might die sooner anyways, why not eat the Taco Bell again today?

I know that’s crazy. Nothing will ever change if I don’t change, and a bad day or moment doesn’t mean a bad eternity. I know I’m still privileged- there are plenty of people older, heavier, and in worse health than me that are committed to making a change. I just struggle to remember that and to get myself into the right state of mind to make changes myself. 

So, fellow redditors, if you have any sympathies, advice, encouragement, or anecdotes- please share them.

Edit: fixed a typo"
"Can you help me, help myself? 🤔 I'm a 36 year old woman.  I am at my highest weight ever somewhere around 220lbs.  I am mortified  Terrified to go to the doctor because I am embarrassed.  My joints hurt,  I am winded easily, and LAZY!  

I struggle with depression and anxiety I am medicated for both.

I also have Hashimotos Thyroiditis which makes it harder but it's not an excuse.

Between quitting smoking and quarantine I gained about 40lbs.   My first realistic goal with is 180 by our summer vacation in August.   

I really need a group of peeps that are wanting to provide accountability and also receive accountability.   My husband while a Saint will never tell me what I should be hearing about my weight.  My body is though in how terrible I feel. 


I have these two PERFECT (athletic)  kids that I want to be able to keep up with and be here for them for the next 50 years and if I don't get my life together I know that isn't going to happen.  

Please help a slacker!"
"I'm in need of a little help with starting my weight loss journey. Hey I'm kinda new to Reddit, and after reading the rules this post seemed appropriate. I'm kinda lost as to how to start my weight loss journey, I've read several websites and the only diet plan that seemed easy to follow was a calorie deficit diet. What I'd really like help with is suggestions on how to start a calorie deficit diet and possible excersises to help me reach my goal. 

•some background knowledge if at all helpful:
- I'm 6'5"", 330 pounds. 19 year old and a male, I'd like to be around 200-230.. I have a treadmill and have a basic weight set.

I appreciate all feedback! Thanks everyone."
"Has weight loss been easy for anyone else? All I see is posts about how everyone is struggling to lose weight, and is always hungry. 

I’m only 3 weeks in but it’s been a lot easier than I thought it would be. I eat my 3 main meals a day with some kind of 100 cal snack after lunch or after dinner if I need it. I’m kinda hungry at times but it’s been easy to control. Before this I felt like I’d pass out if I didn’t eat every couple of hours or have a constantly full stomach. Now I’m eating 1400-1600 cals a day and feeling fine (5’ 8” guy @ 213 pounds). And this is still with the occasional ordering takeout. As long as it fits into my calorie limit I haven’t had an issue. 

Down 10 pounds already with zero exercise, only cutting calories. 

This may come off a bragging, but I was just shocked by looking at the posts on this sub for the first time and it’s allllll struggles. 

Maybe this will help someone realize it may not be as hard as you think to get going."
"Trying to lose the last 10-15lbs? Weigh your food meticulously. It's so important to be precise and meticulous with measurements, especially when you're losing the last few pounds and you don't have as wide a margin of error.

I was counting calories for a couple months but somehow still not losing the weight at the rate I hoped to. I *thought* I was estimating my intake well... then I got a digital food scale and started weighing all my food down to the gram. It helped me realize two things:

\-I am NOT good at eyeballing portions (hahaha). And using measuring cup measurements is not as accurate as I thought!

\-The little bites add up. I'm guilty of grabbing a handful of grapes whenever I walk by the fridge... but that shit adds up over the course of a week/a month.

Target has pretty cheap food scales for less than $20. Definitely worth it.

\*EDIT: This approach isn't for everyone! And it's not something to try and do long-term/forever. I would recommend this to people as an intermediate step to get a better idea of what accurate portions look like. It's not sustainable for a long time, but it helps for the final push when you don't have much fat left to lose.

Good luck y'all! I'd love to hear a little about your experiences/progress too!"
"NSV- My weight loss helped me recover from Covid quickly  One year ago in March I started doing CICO and increasing my activity level in the hopes of losing weight. I didn’t have a specific goal weight, but I knew that I wanted to be healthier overall. Over the past year I’ve kept at it and managed to lose 50lbs, and I’ve also taken up regularly running and lifting weights.

 Fast forward to 10 days ago, when I found out that I had been exposed to Covid by a member of my household. I quickly developed symptoms, but they never escalated to the point of me needing any medical intervention. I’ve been on the mend for the past week, with hopefully no long term negative health effects.

 When I was actively sick, I had a friend who is a cardiologist checking in with me to keep tabs on my symptoms, just making sure that I didn’t have any reason to worry about my heart health. I had a very proud NSV moment when my friend told me, “you’re such a healthy person, that is really going to help you recover quickly.” She called me a healthy person! I was obese at this time last year! Thanks to my weight loss and active lifestyle, I had great cardiovascular health going into my illness, and I’m recovering faster than I ever expected. I’m taking it slow and monitoring my heart rate as I reintroduce exercise into my routine, which is easier to do since I’ve spent the past year keeping tabs on my heart rate as I’ve become a runner.

 I’m happy to be thinner and to fit into cute clothes, but the real reason I needed to lose weight was for my health. I got lucky with my covid experience, but I also got to reap the rewards of my hard work over the past year. I love and am happy to live in this body.

TLDR: I caught covid, but I never got very sick. My recovery has been fast, and it likely would have been much worse if I had a higher BMI or if I weren’t an active person. I’m grateful for the work I’ve put in this year to be a healthier version of me."
"Diet soda Hello friends! 

I’m 20 female, and months into my journey and I find that I haven’t been able to get rid of morning bloating, or the bloated look around my lower belly. My waist has gotten significantly smaller along with every other part of my body, but my lower tummy is the problem area. 

I know things like “bloating” and the fact that that’s just probably where I store the most fat are things I should consider. I don’t have a problem with those things, but I just would like to know whether or not it’s just my body or if there’s something I’m doing to not help the situation. I just have that “soft” look and want to tone up and lose the bloated look. 

I’ve lost around 40 pounds and look amazing, but I’m not where I want to be. I’m doing my best in the gym with weight training and cardio, and have been trying to narrow down a few things in my diet that aren’t helping me. I drink a gallon of water a day and this has significantly helped the bloating, but it just seems that area is very stubborn. 

I’m not really into restrictions, BUT if there’s something that is having a certain effect on my body, I would like to evaluate whether or not I need it in my everyday diet. 

I am on my last two ideas of what I think could be the reason I’m always bloated. Either gluten, or diet soda. I’m now going to take turns cutting both out, but I just wanted to post and see if anyone else can relate to the lower belly bloat that won’t go away, or if they can share their expirences with drinking diet soda or eating gluten and have an intolerance they didn’t know about. 

Now I will say, I know soda isn’t healthy, I just use the diet version because it doesn’t mess with my macros and keeps me sane. Any comments are appreciated, sorry if this is a dumb post.

does anyone have suggestions, comments etc? Thanks! :)"
"Long time listener, first time caller Hey all, M32 5'9"" SW: 310 CW:290

I've been lurking for a while here having been going through my own challenges with mental health, binge eating disorder, and weight fluctuations. I'm a career firefighter so I am in a ""shape"" but throughout life have been a constant binge eater. I carry a lot of extra weight around and it makes me feel very inadequate at my job. I often feel irresponsible and unreliable. 

Daily stress, trauma, and anxiety often take a pretty heavy toll and ever since I've gotten on the job I really struggle with controlling my urge to binge. Over the last year I got covid, double pneumonia, the flu twice, and a back injury, it gave me a lot of time to myself, isolated and alone. Thats what weight loss can feel like to me. 

I'm writing this because I'm finding more courage in opening up about these things. While I am still overeating, the binging has decreased and if I over eat, it's from relatively healthy choices and quality food (I'm I'm pretty decent cook). I'm not looking to lose weight fast or make huge changes, been there, tried that. What I'm having success with is slowly and methodically choosing to make decisions that want lead me down a negative rabbit hole that ends with a $40 binge at the BK Lounge or whatever weapon of fast food choice that's available. 

Tonight was close, but I can happily report that I fought off a potential binge and just made myself some tea instead. I so badly wanted to get in my car and go get food, but I was able to stop myself. It almost didn't work, the internal battle is constant, trying to find excuses, allowing permissions of ""just this once"" or ""tomorrow I'm gonna crush it"", both deals that I've made with myself. This only set myself up for disaster the next day because I would feel like crapola trying to get out of bed or I'd toss and turn with a stomach ache throughout the night. In order to find why I was craving a binge, I had to go inward, understand that I'm feeling anxious, and remember the terrible feeling that comes after binging...it worked. It might seem like something insignificant for many of you who have had so much success and I truly hope to achieve that for myself. For those of you who struggle every day, lurk, and are overwhelmed by how much work there is to do, these thngs are a huge victory. Do the little things, challenge your old programming, cycles and habits...one step at a time.

If you've read this long, thank you for your support and lending me some of your attention. We can all string together healthy decisions and improve our relationship with ourselves and the way in which we treat our bodies! 

Good luck to everyone else out there !"

I am 5'2 and I weigh 72 kgs. I have been working out since a couple of years and managed to reduce just 8 kgs but the fat loss was proportionate i.e I wasn't just burning upper body fat unlike now. I need to lose weight but not just upper body. Also due to the pandemic it's all to work from home now and i have a very sedentary lifestyle due to that. I am literally on a chair for maximum part of my day. I feel this might also be a reason but not too sure as I don't know much about it.
I would be so grateful if anyone could help me."
"Update: I have now lost over 200 pounds, signed up for half marathon Friends, I had a lot of feedback from my last post, so I wanted to give you an update.

In late September, I had lost 157 pounds in 12 months. Since then, I have lost an additional 45 pounds. At the time, I had just run my first (virtual) 10K race. I am now signed up for a half marathon for April. On Friday, I ran over 10 miles in 1 hour, 36 minutes.

[(UPDATED PHOTO)](https://ibb.co/42HdKWN)

I have found that it's harder to keep losing weight. Even as I step up the intensity and length of my workouts, I have found it a little more challenging (but not impossible). My body also looks fat. I have loose skin all over my body, which makes me still feel fat at times.

But guys, I have to tell you it's amazing to be down to 218. I still want to lose a little more, and think I still can.

I also want to say something about companies like Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Advocare and others. I am sure they truly believe in their product. I am sure they work for some people. But I believe they have given people the wrong idea about losing weight. There is a cost of entry to those programs (in some cases, a very expensive cost of entry). It gives so many people the idea that if you don't have the money, you can't diet... THIS IS SO WRONG!

Every bit of research out there shows eating a low-calorie, well-balanced diet coupled with regular exercise leads to weight loss. That isn't that hard. I really feel if you just watch what you eat (I have used an app, but pen and paper still works), and compared that to how many calories you burn a day, odds are, you'll become fit.

Anyway, thanks for everyone who supported me. Below, I have attached my post from late September:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/j2z34u/my\_weight\_loss\_journey\_1\_year\_later/](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/j2z34u/my_weight_loss_journey_1_year_later/)

# My weight loss journey 1 year later

June 2, 2019, I waddled my 420-pound body up Clifton Hill in Niagara Falls. My wife and I have taken an annual road trip for our anniversary every year since getting married in 2014. Our 2019 trip was special as it was the first time I had ever spent the night outside of the United States.

I had always been fairly athletic despite my size. I played basketball and tennis almost every day growing up. My diet, however, was horrific. I lived off Hot Pockets and ice cream. But exercising every day at least kept me from ballooning as a teenager.

Then adulthood came, and the perceived time I had for exercise was replaced with work and chores. Leisure no longer felt like a priority.

Walking never felt like a challenge, and the walk from our hotel to the falls wasn’t hateful as it was downhill. But returning from the falls, I was gassed. The simple act of walking had fatigued me to the point that I had to stop. I was shameful.

I had never really felt “unhealthy” until this point.

**Shamers be shaming**

August 3, 2019, was a gut-wrenching day for many of us in the US. That Saturday, I had just taken Jenna’s car to get an oil change. We found out her rear brake lights would not work, and it appeared there were electrical malfunctions. We were planning on replacing her car at the end of the year, so leaning of a potentially expensive electrical issue prompted us to decide on buying a new car.

When I came home, I heard that there was a massacre at the El Paso Walmart. I checked in with our Saturday person at work, and she was going to need some relief at some point (any one who has worked in breaking news understands how draining these massacres are).

After working an unexpected Saturday shift, I went to bed planning on teaching a few classes in the morning and then going to buy Jenna a new car. After briefly falling asleep, I received a text that another massacre happened, this time just 15 miles down the road in Dayton. Having graduated from Wright State and then working at the Dayton Daily News, I had many friends living in that immediate area. My thoughts turned to them as I now had to work another shift, this time in an area I knew quite well.

While reporting on the events taking place in Dayton, some of my tweets went viral. Immediately, some of the responses weren’t about the shooting, but about my weight. There is this huge tragedy happening in Dayton, and my weight was the issue for some on social media.

To be fair to other reporters, this was a new experience for me. For many of my (especially female) colleagues, the vitriol of fat-shamers can be far worse. I am not an on-camera journalist, but for those who are, the shaming can be downright vitriolic. But given the two tragedies going on, it was tough to process this hate I was receiving.

A few weeks later, I watched a segment on Bill Maher’s show about how there should be more fat-shaming in society. It had me thinking that all of those people tweeting at me during another tragic night in our country were the ones who were right, and who am I to judge them?

I decided to get a gym membership. But the very thing that was driving me to get in shape was what was scaring me off. If these fat-shamers are so spiteful online, how much shame will I face at a gym?

Last September, I went for a walk at VOA Park in Butler County, Ohio. The loop there is 1.5 miles. I felt so exhausted just going once around that loop.

I had enough.

I knew I wanted to get into shape.

For several weeks starting around late September 2019, weighing over 420 pounds, I started walking as fast and long as I could. The 1.5-mile walk quickly became 3-mile walks. While I wasn’t seeing results on the scale, I was feeling better mentally.

**Shamers replaced with cheerleaders**

After a few walks, I already ran into a few folks at VOA Park who saw how much of a sweat I was working up, and gave me so much encouragement to keep moving. I never expected to get thumbs up from people. You quickly realize that for every person out there shaming you, there are dozens ready to push you and help you.

As the weather turned colder, I finally worked up the courage to enter a gym. And it’s true about Planet Fitness… it truly is the “No Judgement Zone.”

People there were so wonderful. Hearing people say “good work” was a great affirmation that I was in the right place.

My time spent exercising prompted me to do a lot of research on how to lose weight, and what I could do to drop weight. There are SO MANY diets out there. Which one is right for me?

It seemed the one constant was you have to watch your calories. If you burn more calories than you consume, you’ll lose weight. I am pretty good with numbers and statistics, so I realized that this could be a winner.

So I decided to go with a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet. Coupled with exercise, I found myself losing weight QUICKLY. In the month of December alone, I lost 25 pounds.

I have not put anything in my body that I don’t track. I track every calorie I eat. It is a great way to hold oneself accountable.

Last December was when exercising no longer felt like a chore but routine. I was no longer “forcing myself” to exercise, and had to force myself to take a few day off for rest.

This habit of eating 2,000 calories a day and exercising almost every day simply became my routine, and unlike past diets, it felt like this one worked for me. If I wanted to have a cookie, I could, but I had to make up for it somewhere else. My habit of eating a whole package of Oreos quickly disappeared, however. I have bought a few package of cookies since, but it seems they spoil before I get a chance to finish the container.

**Then came COVID**

March 11 started off a good day. My weigh-in had me down 78 pounds since October. I went to the gym and had a good workout on the stair stepper. I then went to work.

Our whole world felt like it changed in one night.

That evening, the NBA suspended the season, President Trump suspended travel between Europe and the US, and Tom Hanks announced he had the coronavirus. It felt like all of a sudden, the coronavirus was going to have a major impact on our way of life for months to come.

Leaving work that night in a bit of a haze, all I wanted to do was stress eat.

I got off at an interstate exit and was about to order a midnight McDonald’s hamburger.

Then when I got to the drive thru, I saw my gym membership dangling from my keys and decided not to undo the effort I put in that day at the gym. So I drove home and opted for a small, more calorie-friendly snack.

In the days to come, I decided to workout from home. I found myself doing step aerobics on a daily basis, thanks to my wife finding a fantastic YouTube channel. I am so thankful for Jenny Ford for her encouragement as she is a great step aerobics instructor. Even though I don’t do step aerobics as often, I plan on doing more as the weather gets colder. It’s a great full-body workout that requires very little equipment. And it doesn’t require going to an indoor gym during a pandemic!

**Becoming a runner**

At the start of 2020, I thought it would be cool to do a 5K. But I didn’t just want to walk one, so I decided if I could go 5Ks in less than 45 minutes, I’d sign up for one. Little did I know the only options for 2020 would be virtual.

I never really thought I’d enjoy running. It never appealed to me.

In May, I tested myself by seeing how fast I could go at the park. It was the first time I had jogged or walked in two months. I crossed the proverbial finish line in less than 40 minutes.

YES!

Time to sign up for a 5K!

It also turns out running is a great way to burn calories. This started to become my daily routine. It also is such a great way to clear the mind. I put on some music and don’t think about work or the ills of the world.

This is also where I picked up more cheerleaders. I never truly planned on documenting my weight loss journey. I thought to myself I am doing this for myself, and not those dreaded fat-shamers.

But I posted some photos of my first runs, and your support was so overwhelming. It truly motivated me to keep going.

On July 3, I ran my first official 5K. Not that I was counting, but my photo from that day had over 200 Facebook likes... more than I got for my wedding. HAHA

It was time for a new challenge: a 10K. I completed my first 10K on September 14 in 1 hour, 11 minutes. A few days later, I set my 5K PR at 29 minutes.

Let’s say beyond the improvement of my physical health, my mental health has improved so much too.

I have felt so fortunate to have my health and fitness back during a time that so many are suffering, I decided to organize a 5K to benefit Feeding America. A small group of friends have joined, and we have already enough participants to contribute nearly 2,500 meals to Feeding America.

If anyone is interested to join, it is on Facebook as the [“Beat COVD, Beat Hunger 5k Fun Run.”](https://www.facebook.com/events/778533599572213)

**What’s next**

As I end my first year of diet and exercise, I can announce I have lost 157 pounds. Even at 263 pounds, I am still considered “obese.” There is more weight I want to lose as I want to continue doing more with running. I have already started planning on running a half marathon in 2021. Nine months ago, even the idea of doing a 5K didn’t feel like a given.

I understand losing weight is not as challenging as maintaining weight loss. But I am sure with the constant support I have received from so many of you, I will give it my all in keeping the weight off.

One reason I write this is because I have gotten several messages from others saying how my new lifestyle has caused them to get more fit. I can’t tell you what it means to be an inspiration to others. Given all of the perceived hate in the world, love is what rules. And I have felt the love from my dear friends and family, especially Jenna!

Thank you to everyone for your love and support. You all mean so much to me and I feel so proud that I have been able to inspire others to get out and enjoy the outdoors!"

"Something I hope to remember when I'm 'healthy'... Health is very important, we can all agree on that one. That's why the majority of us are here! But when other things start effecting how your body works, how you have to heal, ways that might hold you back... REMEMBER when you wanted it so bad to be the most healthy version of yourself. 

I'm (hopefully!) getting over a bout of Cancer soon that has caused all sorts of cravings, bloating, weight gain, snacking habits, etc and through it all I've learned that it's what my body needs. BUT I have learned that the healthier I eat, the better I feel because, well, DUH. Heck yeah I have gummy candy on hand everyday all day long but I can not get over how wonderful chilled fresh fruit is (cantaloupe ftw)! 

With restrictions in my treatment on what I can eat too I have learned that living without something like cheese is doable but NOT in the long term for me. Substitutes for it though... oh playing with new things is so FUN! Nutritional yeast is on my list next! There are WAYS to do this, to lose it and be happy about it. If something isn't working, TWEAK. You are your own person with individual goals, work it how you need to. 

Yeah, I've gained over 20lbs and am close to 200lbs in total now at 5'6"", but I know my body needs love. I'm learning some tricks along the way and that's all I could ever ask for right now. Take care of you and you will take care of you. 

Let's kick some ass guys and gals, love y'all!"
"I'm Getting Older And I've Noticed Some Things... I am in my early 30s and wow... Things are different lol

I am on an antidepressant and birth control, which both can tribute to weight issues. It's never really been an issue before, but now, it kinda is.

I was in shape pre pandemic (weight lifter!) But during the shut down, I gained belly fat and lost muscle, which did a number on my self esteem. 

Now, I'm back at it, but I am having such a hard time. I feel ravenous with hunger allllll the damn time now. I can't go 4 hours without feeling like I could eat.my own leg. 

The weight is just stuck on me. Before, it was sliding off after the first month, even if I was over a bit on my daily calorie goal. But not this time lol wtf...

I hate it, but I am still at it. Surely, eventually, I'll see fat loss, right? I think I'm just being paranoid... But still.

What can I do to stop this animalistic hunger? Any tips to keep me from pouting? Lol"
"Any PCOS/Endometriosis sufferers on here? Tips, tricks, advice? My PCOS and Endometriosis diagnoses officially came at the end of last year, and was sort of a footnote in a post-hysterectomy consultation, so I wasn't given any information on dealing with it and stuff.

Granted, beacuse the uterus is finally gone, my conditions plague me a lot less than they used to, however, I'm aware that they cause things like water retention and bloating and stuff.

I've hit a plateau. 57KG (I'm 169cm tall), and it simply *refuses* to move. I've started logging my calories in MFP (instead of Samsung Health), but I can't help but wonder if my conditions are affecting my weight, or if there's anything I can do to help combat them with my diet."
"I feel trapped (23F) (CW, 306 lbs) Hi. I have been overweight my entire life. Always the biggest girl in my classes and in my friend group. As a child, I wasn't taught how to nourish my body or eat proper foods, so this is all I know. I have tried multiple times to lose anything, even 10 lbs, and I always end up gaining it back, plus some. This is something that consumes  my thoughts constantly. There's not a moment that I'm not thinking about how I look. I always look at my smaller, prettier friends, and compare myself to them. Anytime we go out anywhere, they're always the ones that get the attention, and I have to play as the ''funny fat friend''. This has destroyed my confidence, and over the years I have developed anxiety and depression because of it. I just assume any person I like won't ever like me back because of my size. It feels like a cycle, because food is where I go to feel safe and happy. In turn it only hurts me. Thankfully, I haven't developed any major health issues, but I just feel trapped in my body. I want to motivate myself to make a change, but I don't know how to stay consistent. I just feel like I'm wasting my younger years being insecure, and I want to break the cycle. Any advice would help."
"Can we talk for a sec about how HARD starting is? So I just started cutting again in preparation for summer. I’m not trying to lose too much, and my calories really around that low for my height and activity level (1400-1500). And oh my God, I forgot how hard it is to go from eating maintenance to being in a caloric deficit!

Your whole body is like “what the FUCK are you doing right now???” Your hunter hormones are whacky. Your sleep schedule gets disrupted. It’s absolutely miserable. 

But it’s just an adjustment period. After about a week things calm down. Your body gets used to it. You stop feeling like you’re gonna die. You’re no longer hungry all the time.

So for anyone who just started and is feeling terrible, know that it’s going to get easier! Seriously! You’ll adjust. You just gotta make it through the first week.

(If it’s been longer than a week/week and a half and you’re still feeling awful, though, that means something’s off. You probably aren’t eating enough.)"
"Today is Day 3 of my attempt to claw my way out of rock bottom. Succeeded in major weightloss and fitness gains...and then spiraled and undid it all. In 2018 I was 35 and lost about 115lbs, getting down to 130 (then 35F, 5'5"").  I lost it in a little under a year. But I fell off the wagon and I fell off hard.  I struggle with depression and anxiety and some past trauma.  Once I slipped up and began spiraling downward it didn't take long to completely revert to my former sedentary state.  And once that began happening it just made me feel worse and lead to gaining more.  I'm sure many if you know that cycle.

I'm not sure of my current weight but I'm afraid to get on the scale and find out.  I'm afraid I'll let the number I see discourage me.  Rationally I know I shouldn't, but I know myself.  So I think first I'd like to try to make some progress in bettering my lifestyle and getting back into better shape before I do that.  And I started that Sunday, 3 days ago.  I went for a mile run (aka slow jog) all 3 days, went on walks walks my 3yo daughter and played at the playground with her, today I roller skated a little bit.

In 2018 I busted my butt and reached a point when I was running 5k 3-4 days a week.  Reached the point when I could push myself to do 10k.  I was into roller derby for a short time.  I had never felt or looked better.  I want to feel that way again.  I want to feel proud of my run distances, of my ever improving 1 mile pace, I want to do a color run again and a zombie run for the first time (if these things even still exist in covid world).  I want to be a good role model for a daughter, be the mom she deserves, a better partner to my SO.  I want to feel good about myself again.  I haven't in quite some time.  I'm about about hit rock bottom if not already there.

If I had to guess I'm probably at least 180+ lbs now but I'm really not sure.  And I definitely lost a ton of muscle and replaced it with fat.  I hate it and I'm angry at myself.  So now I'm turning it around.  It's time to fight through the depression, anxiety, and apathy again.  And I guess that's why I'm here posting.  This community helped me get there in 2018.  I'm hoping coming back here and making this post will help keep me on track.

So, here I am.  Day 3 of getting my life back on track in a lot of aspects.  Regaining my health and confidence is an important first step.  I'm making efforts to eat better and more mindfully and I will exercise in some way ir another every day.  Someone come kick my ass if I don't, lol.

Wish I didn't need to lose it again, but happy to be back among such an awesome community :)."
"I’ve lost 45lbs and I’m still fat. It’s so frustrating can anyone else relate? 5’11 24F SW:256 CW:215

I’ve lost almost 45lbs over the last year going from a BMI of 36 to 29 and while I am proud of my progress and lifestyle changes I have been feeling low this week because even though I’m a whole small child of weight gone I. Am. Still. Fat. 

My ultimate goal weight is 180 and I am aiming to be 200 by my birthday (in June) and I do understand that slow and steady wins the race - but I just needed to rant about my frustrations with weight loss. I’m aiming to lose about 60-70lbs total (I am extremely tall and at my lowest weight of around 165 I looked too thin for my body so 170-180s is my ideal range) BUT ITS SO ANNOYING GETTING THERE.

I just wanted to rant - has anyone who has lost large amounts of weight felt this? Any tips or advice?

Thanks so much!"
"Maintenance Year 3 I turned 50 last week and have been reflecting on things I’ve learned in my life — including the realization that my body composition is the result of my own choices. Learning that lesson has helped me make some serious changes to my eating and fitness.

https://i.imgur.com/MvLpCCO.jpg
(Photo is 2016, 2017, 2018, and today)

I joined the r/loseit and r/fatlogic subreddits in 2017. They helped me finally realize that I was 100% responsible for my obesity and that I looked like I did as a result of my own choices. So right before I turned 46 I started making different choices. This May will be the 3 year mark since my [“first shirt-off summer in decades.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/8micnn/m4757_240lbs_188lbs_52lbs_8_months_first_shirt/). I’ve kept the excess weight off and have continued to reach and set new fitness goals.

It’s still not easy for me, but it finally feels sustainable. I don’t do IF or Keto or Paleo. I just eat less than I burn. I’d been obese since my 20s and I kick myself for not starting sooner, but it really never is too late.

I still lurk here because reading others’ victories and setbacks helps motivate me. And maybe knowing that an old, fat computer geek can do it might help motivate you, too.

Don’t give up. Be honest and consistent. You CAN do it."
"Should I do maintenance for a bit? Should I be moving to maintenance for a while?

So I lost 17 lbs by counting calories and going to the gym. But I won’t be back in the gym for another month or two, two at the max. I’ve been eating 1200-1300 a day, been doing well. But i only lost one lb in a month. Is this my body’s way of saying “You need to up your calorie intake for a bit? My maintenance is 1594 a day. I had to quit the gym because my boyfriend and I are moving hopefully soon. But my trainer said to eat 1500 whenever I’m at the gym and 1200 whenever i’m not. But i’ve been eating 1200 a day since the end of November, maybe. I don’t know if this is my body’s way of being like “you need a few weeks of more calories” but I’m terrified of losing progress. Any ideas?"
"My health is bad and I want/think losing weight can benefit me, but I need advice. I’m a 49 year old woman who weighs 92kg/202lbs and is 171cm/5,2f tall. I gave birth to 3 kids. 

I suffer from a rare chronic condition called ehlers danlos and it negatively affects my joints. I’m afraid I’ll end up in a wheelchair if I’m not taking action. Besides medical treatment for this I’m thinking that losing weight can at least reduce the pain I experience throughout the day.  

I’m aware I’m very overweight at this moment. I’ve tried multiple attempts trying to lose weight. Currently my eating habbits are pretty bad though. No, I’m not eating too much, I’m eating too little. Throughout my life I never eaten enough. On average I eat around 1000 calories a day. I know while eating this little calories your body starts to save fat up. Although I’m confused how this results in me being this much overweight. I almost never eat fast food or anything like that. I also have a regular job, so I’m not sitting still all day either. 

Anyway, I just want to point out that doing sports is something that’s hard to do due of my joints. The places that are most troublesome for me are my feet. Swimming can be a valid option, but due of corona that’s a idea I have to skip for now. 

Advice is extremely appreciated.

Edit; 

I appreciate the replies a lot and I take them all in account. Many (if not all) says that 1000’s calories a day is simply not possible. It’s actually true that I do eat on average around a 1000’s calories, but I’ve days I eat more. I’ve downloaded the recommended app and I’m going to pay more attention to it. Again, thank you!"
"Dealing with foot/joint pain/plantar fasciitis impacting weight loss journey I have always suffered with foot problems due to very flat feet ever since I was little. It's never been super bad though and hasn't really tended to stop me doing anything. However, last year I sprained an ankle badly, and that coupled with the pandemic made me super sedentary for a few months. Since then I've have had constant problems and pain with both feet.

The sprain is now better, but both my feet are in pain all the time that I think must be from plantar fasciitis (which I've been diagnosed with before). It makes it very hard to do any meaningful exercise like running, and even makes normal walking painful. I've been doing exercises meant to help PF but so far they just feel worse. I'm pretty sure my weight and the fact I'm aging (early 30s) is why they're so bad now.

For context, I'm 5'10 and c 300lbs, so I'm conscious it definitely puts strain on my joints. I've always been super active until I sprained my ankle though (running, hiking, weight lifting etc) and my inability to even walk without pain is really getting me down and making weight loss feel harder.

I can't see a physio due to COVID at the mo, so that option is out sadly.

Anyone experienced something similar? Any advice?"
"Compulsive eating is stopping me at the last 15lbs So my official weight loss journey started January 2019 as part of my resolution. I started at 204.7lbs (highest was 230ish) and at the end i was down to 170lbs. 2020 was very inconsistent, I was as high as 177 to as low as 158 and I'm currently at 163 (5'8"" male.) I've been idling for the last 3-4 months. I've gone back on and off multiple diet strategies. At one point I only ate when I was hungry and it was fine for a bit but then I got sick of not getting to stuff my face with everything sweet around me. I want to be in the low 150s but I feel so powerless at this point, I can't seem to diet for more than a month straight although I have been exercising for the last 3 months. I tried moderation eating with sweets but that only ends back at 3000c of junk food everyday. Any help from someone who's experienced something similar would be appreciated. 

P.S. I know my weight is in the healthy bmi range but it is there just barely. I've got quite a lot of subcutaneous fat around my abdomins, particularly in my love handles."
"Weighed out a portion of chips and DIDN'T EAT THE WHOLE BAG!!!! Chips were my downfall. I was always overweight, but after highschool I moved out from my parents house with ZERO idea of what nutrition was, and into an extremely stressful period of my life. It was also across the street from a corner store. *the perfect storm.* 

On average, I'd go through a bag and a half of family-sized chips every day. On top of whatever terrible takeaway dinner I had, and starbucks in the morning. Looking back on it, that is far too much. Seeing people pull out a bag of chips, eat some, then put it into the pantry for LATER was always insane to me. I almost found it funny. Why would you only eat some if you could eat them all???

It quickly turned into a comfort. The crunchiness and familiar flavours calmed me down in the hectic life I had grown into. And I kept going on like that for a while.

A few years later, I'm almost 100lbs less and a whole new person, but still I have never sat down with a bag of chips without finishing it. Obviously it happens FAR less often. (Maybe every 2 months when I get suuuper lazy) Last night, I had some calories left over in my budget. My boyfriend popped open a bag of chips and I sat down beside him. I was nervous because I honestly don't trust myself around chips.

So I grabbed a bowl, grabbed my scale, and poured out 50 grams of chips. WAY more than I thought I would get, putting it in a bowl makes it look SO much bigger. And I found myself enjoying the chips more when I only had a few of them, vs when blindly shoving my hand in a bag.

I felt super accomplished. I FEEL super accomplished. I had my favourite snack and didn't go ""off track"" for the day, and it completely quenched my craving and I feel more confident around a food I usually overindulge in.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope everyone has a good day and doesn't eat a bazillion calories worth of chips!"
"Complete Loss of Appetite. Should I be concerned? I have been losing weight since July 2020. I did take 2 months off for maintenance and then in January 2021 I decided that I wanted to start losing again. My stats are 27F|5'2""|SW:180|CW:160|GW:125. Recently I have completely lost my appetite, to the point of my stomach growling and I just have no desire to eat. I have been forcing myself to eat but its been difficult to come close to 1500 a day. Right now I'm sitting at around 900-1200 a day. It has been this way for about a week now. I'm wondering if something is wrong and if I should see a doctor. The changes I have made are minimal at best which explains the slow weight loss but I'm taking it slow for it to be sustainable for life. The biggest change I made in January was no empty calories except I allow myself to have alcohol 1 day a week but never on weekdays. After I cut the soda and excess alcohol out I did notice that my natural feeling of fullness had returned. Now I get hungry and after a few bites I am full or the thought of finishing my food makes me nauseous. Like I stated   I haven't made many huge changes mainly just portion size and thinking about what I'm putting into my body and making better choices. I only work out about 2 days a week but my household chores keep me active for roughly 3 hours a night so I'm not pushing the exercise at the moment. I have never had a bingeing problem but my family are all very naturally skinny (and so was I until 20) so I grew up eating garbage food and washing it down with soda. My husband commented that maybe my body is just not used to the nutrition I've been giving it now. That doesn't sound right to me but I have never had this happen. Any advice would be greatly appreciated because I am starting to get quite worried that something is wrong."
"This is the first day of my life... **tl;dr** After realizing that I haven’t healed from YEARS of trauma and the death of a loved one, I am finally ready to give myself the unconditional love and support and friendship that I give to everyone else in my life. It’s very scary.

**I have thought about writing this-and consequently have put it off-over and over for months.**

I’m not sure why the idea of writing this all out has seemed so daunting, other than perhaps the most obvious answer, which is that it’s not an easy thing to do.

I want to write about my weight loss goals and the support I’m hoping to find in this community, because I think it could really change the way I view and engage with my ambitions and beliefs about weight loss/ myself. But it feels like I can’t do that without explaining how I got here.

This may be long winded, but I really hope some of you read this. And I’ll do my best to keep it to only the most necessary details.

I sat in the doctor’s office (where I’m guessing so many of our epiphanies occur) the other day and was going in to meet a psychiatrist. I hadn’t expected to get weighed. Weigh ins have long been a source of complete and utter terror/anxiety for me. I am 26 now, and I remember being in middle school and having public weigh in’s in PE (which definitely should not be allowed????) and being completely sick over the prospect of it. This is a deep rooted anxiety, which goes far beyond the number on the scale. But more on that later. For now, I’m sitting in the plastic chair of the psychiatrist’s waiting room, being told it’s time for my vitals to be taken. I understand why it was necessary, but it was a real moment of heartbreak for me. That is something that I have really become aware of in my life-how my complete awareness of my body (and the way it looks and moves and the space it takes up) makes even the most innocuous tasks very emotional for me. I don’t have a single moment free from that. I am constantly perceiving the world through a lens that is hyper focused on my weight and my body. It’s led to an agoraphobia and fear of places and people that totally contradicts my personality. I’m a super social person and I love being out in the world. But I don’t want to be seen. I want to hide. I am….I’m sad. I’m sad.

She tells me my weight. 250. 250!!!!! There’s freedom in typing that. No one in my life would believe that number. Though this is by far the highest weight I’ve ever been, a lifetime of masking and over-compensating for my body has forced me to figure out how to camoflauge very well. I’m guessing most people would think I was 180 or so. Now that I think back on being 180 and thinking THEN that I was out of control, it all just makes me feel a little deflated. I sat there, actually very numb, and thought-”It’s okay, because this isn’t even your body. That’s just a number. It doesn’t reflect who you are and where you’re going.” 

My protective mechanism is disassociation. I learned to do it when I was very young and living with a tragically and dangerously alcoholic parent. I was not abused, but I witnessed my mother attempting suicide, was forced to call 911 for her multiple times by the age of 9, had to learn to deal with her alcohol related seizures, grew up without the love of stable female figures in my early  life (I’m a woman, since I failed to mention that earlier), etc etc. I love to write and paly music and act, so I genuinely began crafting fantasies of my future where I would be safe and loved and paid attention to. I should mention here that I have an INCREDIBLE father who has done a remarkable job in raising me. But as a single parent, he worked a lot and I definitely felt unloved and abandoned until I was old enough to understand the sacrifices he made for me. (Late teens, early twenties is when our relationship fully became the solid best friendship it is now. He’s my rock, and he honestly is the reason I’ve gotten this far. Love him SO much.)

I always had a lot of friends and was genuinely very loved, so I don’t want to make it seem like I was physically alone. I think there was more a deep, deep, feeling of abandonment and unworthiness, having to take care of a parent that young. I couldn’t understand why my mom couldn’t get better for me. She was a great mom when she was sober, and she was full of love. But her own hurt and pain from her own life got in the way. She was the youngest of 6 kids, born to Hollywood director and actor parents, very beautiful and smart, and she was put into dangerous positions at way too young of an age in the 70’s and 80’s. super interesting, and I will post about it one day. But her mother, my grandma, was an alcoholic (though she’s 55 years sober now! Go Grandma Josephine!) and she was the victim of alot of misjustice. I am not blaming her. But there was so much pain for me from such an early age. She felt very guilty about it, and when she was with me, she’d shower me in gifts and yummy food. Things my dad wouldn’t give me. I still remember my first McDonald’s hamburger and my first Jack In the Box hamburger when I was in kindergarten. That created the blueprint for the emotional relationship with food I only JUST realized I have!!!

Anyway, fast forward through the early years. I became an adolescent with no mom and very little contact with her side of the family. My hips started to grow. My breasts started to grow. My dad did his best, but he was a punk rock guy with a 12 year old girl. He had NO idea how to tell me what was happening to my body. He bought me my first bra and first box of tampons and never made me feel embarrassed, but he also didn’t really know how to talk about it with me. (Once again, I totally understand. Lmao. Bless my dad. I still remember phone calls with him from the tampon aisle asking me if I wanted the “blue flavor or the green flavor” which was nervous dad for “regular or super.” He’s a precious man.)

I truly began to compartmentalize. I was happy, in general, and very bubbly and social-but all the while this deep, soul, wound felt as if it was growing and growing. I struggled with weight, but it hurts my heart to think of it, because I was perfect how I was. I was a kid. 

People have talked about my body since I can remember. I am black/french and Italian, which basically means Black and White, and from the time I was 5 years old, I was aware of how different I supposedly was. When I was 5, I remember playing house with two classmates in my kindergarten class, and there was a discussion of who was going to be mommy, daddy, and baby. It was myself, another little girl, and a boy named Matthew Fuller. I’ll never forget his name or his face. I and the other little girl both wanted to be “mommy” (EW at this gendered nuclear family bullshit, btw. It’s so gross to think back on how conditioned we are from a young age to place ourselves in these roles and be seen as a wife and mother. UGH...but I digress) but Matthew made the choice. He told me I was fat and my skin was too brown. LITERALLY. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID.

I was a baby...he was a baby! But I carried that with me through out my LIFE, man. I really did. And the microaggressions of being a mixed girl with a white mama and a black dad in the 90’s and 2000’s really played a role in how I saw myself. And by extension, how I treated myself.

By my teen years, I felt ugly and fat. I have had the same group of best friends since I was 11. I got SO lucky. They’re the best people on Earth. And they are BEAUTIFUL. I’m not just saying that. Like, my friends are incredibly beautiful. And I always felt like I was the funny one, or the smart one, or definitely the artistic one-but that seemed to pale in comparison to always being the one the cute boys wanted to talk to. And again, I want to stress-looking back, it hurts me how hard I’ve always been on myself. I was beautiful, too. I have always been smaller in terms of bone structure and height. At that time I was probably 5 feet tall or so. And I was around 150 pounds. I have an hourglass figure, so I carried the weight pretty well. But I also was comparing myself to my friends with completely different genetics, and I felt like I was hideous in comparison. It completely changed my life. I had panic attacks before things that were supposed to be fun, like parties and outings. When we were younger, my more neurotypical friends struggled to understand this, and thought it was dramatic of me to decide I literally could not go out if I couldn’t find something to wear. But again, I didn’t have the tools or comprehension to explain how much deeper it was than just not liking my outfit.

I was sexually assaulted at 16 by a close friend. The situation was awful and nobody really understood that rape could happen even if you were drinking and even if it was your friend. My experience was invalidated and ignored. It took a really long time to heal from that. Not sure if I have, to be honest.

Feeling unlovable, I then lost my virginity at 17 to my friend’s older brother who was much older and was super sketchy. I continued that pattern, of weaponizing my body to combat the voice inside of me telling me I wasn’t good enough.

The things that happened to me sexually as a result of that still really hurt me. I told no one.

I have dedicated my life to being the best friend and daughter I can possibly be to distract everyone from the fact that I am so afraid I will never find my person. I feel so much love for everyone that it feels like my heart is going to explode. But that is also my biggest weakness, because sometimes I feel so much it just hurts. It makes my eyes water writing that.

I’ve thought of killing myself constantly since I was like, 19. 

My dream was-and is still-to be a writer and entertainer. I want to be able to perform live without fear. I want to be able to act. And yet I feel like my weight is keeping me from my dreams.

I know that isn’t true. But the idea of failing to achieve my dreams is genuinely worse than death. And sometimes I think it would be easier not to exist. But I know how much it would hurt the people who love me and depend on me. So I never, ever will. I love life so much that it makes me want to die. Because I feel everything so deeply I sometimes can’t bear it.

My friend died in June almost 2 years ago. He was one of my best friends ever. I loved him deeply. I was always partially in love with him. I even thought one day, maybe, maybe MAYBE we might end up together. He felt like my soul mate sometimes. We met when we were 15 and he died at 24. He was super, super, wounded. In ways I didn’t even know the extent of. He OD’ed. He had just gotten out of rehab. I was supposed to take him to a meeting that day. Instead he died. I spoke to him the night before. I still can’t think about it. I cry, and I cry and I cry. I love you, J. I miss you.

I got a DUI. It was just a really dark time for me. I am SO FUCKING PROUD of coming out of that. My friend was dead and I found myself in the deepest well I’d ever been in. I think that trauma literally changed the chemistry of my brain. Nothing made sense anymore. Couldn’t focus. My eating went to hell. I mean….I feel like I lost those 2 years of my life. I don’t even remember them. I was in so much pain that I didn’t address.

Throughout those years, I abused my body, starved it, harmed it, you name it. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety as well as body dismorphia. I'm pretty sure I have a form of PTSD, but I've never been officially diagnosed.

Fast forward to now. I’m 26. I have done so much mental and emotional healing. All of the times I’d tried to lose weight in the past, it was about the physical. It was about a number on the scale. It was about the attention of men. It was about trivial things. Surface things. I never addressed the pain beneath. I never EVER gave myself grace or love or compassion, even though I am an incredibly loving and compassionate person.

It just kind of dawned on me the other day, even before the doctor’s visit, that I have begun to heal myself in a deep and personal way. I am unlearning my conditioned toxic beliefs each day. I truly love myself. I want a good life for myself. I know how capable and deserving I am. I have handled everything so far-and it can’t be for nothing. I am currently working on finishing an album and publishing my second zine of artwork and poetry. I look in the mirror and although I still feel triggered and sad-I know that isn’t the objective reality. I AM a beautiful person. And luckily, I’m actually very healthy. I just got a full panel of blood tests. I have no physical illnesses other than PCOS, which explains a lot of my weight gain and metabolism issues.  I'm on medication for that as well as mental health meds.

I am on medication for my depression and anxiety, which is giving me the motivation to actually get out of bed in the morning. I am LUCKY. I have a father who loves me. Friends who are an amazing support system. 

I have all of the tools to be successful. I saved up money, quit my job, and moved back home. I am safe here. I have the time and means to eat well and exercise. I am writing and working on my art. I am talking to my mom again, with my own boundaries set.

All that’s left is this. To care about myself enough to make my life better. To take control over my disordered eating. To be present and actively participate in my wonderful life.

I deserve it. We all fucking deserve that!!!!! So. I’m going to do it. It’s never felt like this before.

I guess, I’m just ready. I’m sure I left stuff out, but I’ve already written a fucking novel. I’m sorry about that. I needed to get that all out.

If you made it this far-you are amazing. Seriously. You had no reason to care, but the fact that you did makes me feel seen. Please, please, engage with me. Let me know if you have any thoughts, feelings, shared emotions, whatever! I truly look forward to the community I can build here, and hopefully it will help me with accountability and encouragement.

Lastly, I will show you my starting pictures. I plan to update later, so I really want to have the initial photos here to compare to eventually. There are also some areas I'm kind of fixated on that I hope I can gain a more objective perspective on. Yikes, this part is really scary. But I want to be transparent about this process.  I'm just gonna throw in some pictures I took right now....so excuse my crazy hair and blah blah blah.

I’m terrified! Wish me luck! My life awaits!

"It‘s been 3 weeks with no weight lost SW: 104,3 kg/229,9 lbs, CW: 93,2/205,5 kg, GW: 70kg/154lbs

Hey guys!
Since october I‘ve (F23) been losing weight and i did notice that 2 weeks before my period my weight would either stay stagnant or move just 200-300 grams up or down on the scale. When my Period starts I‘ll suddenly lose 1-1,5 kg. So I know it is normal but this has been going on for 3 weeks and now I do not know if I hit a plateau or if my body is just weird like that. 
What do you think? And do you have any tips on how to overcome a plateau?

A little bit more Info: I am eating inbetween 1550-1750 kcal a day and workout 5-6 times a week."
"Looking for a calorie counting app Hello everyone!
My family and I want to lose weight together and we started counting calories.
We currently use Lifesum, however it doesn't really fit our needs.
Now I'm looking for an alternative app and I hope you have some recommendations! :) 

I should be able to put in my own recipies and it would be useful if I can put in the amount of grams the meal has instead of the portions because we all eat a different amount. The way we have to do it now is very complicated and takes a lot of time to calculate. 

It would be perfect if I could be able to share the recipe, so that my family members can track the same one. Because right now one of us puts in the recipe and then we calculate the calories for each person and they can only put in the calories and don't have the nutrients. 

Thanks for your help! I appreciate every bit of advice! :) 

(Please excuse any mistakes I made, English is my second language.)

Edit: Thank you for your recommendations, they look very promising! I downloaded them and I'll try them all out for a few days. Thank you!"
"My Weight Loss Journey Turned Into Weight Gain????? At the start of February I decided I would go healthy. Just to lose some extra pounds gained during COVID. For reference, I was 136 pounds when I started this, probably like 130/132 pre-covid. 

I reduced my calorie intake to 1300-1400, and I make sure those calories stay on the healthy side. I started drinking 2 liters of water per day. I also started working out 6 days a week. I do that workout everyone loves on TikTok, but I do a 15 incline/3 speed/30 minutes on the treadmill. 1 day for recovery. 

So I thought I was doing everything right, and then I weighed myself 2 weeks in, I had gained 5 pounds. Tried not to get discouraged, but week 3 at the same time of day... 6 pounds gained since Feb 1. And now, 4 weeks in, still 6 pounds heavier than I started on Feb 1.... The scale is saying I am 142 pounds when I started at 136.

Anyone else experience this? Everything online talks about ""temporary weight gain"" from water retention. I read the articles over and over to make myself feel better, but when will the gain go away?? Everyone says within 2-3 weeks, but here I am 4 weeks in and still with the weight gain! I started taking magnesium daily cause someone recommended that to drop water retention, but 4 days in, no change. 

Am I crazy or is my body reacting the complete opposite of expected? I was better off before I started working out!"
"Weight stall and IUD? Anyone? I switched my birth control to an IUD about 5 weeks ago.

The week after, while my hormones were changing, I had INSANE cravings and weird mood swings and despite that, I managed to stay on track. (Heck ya!)

I have been using Lose It and was progressing along nicely, one pound a week. I haven't deviated.

Two weeks after my IUD insertion, my weight hadn't changed. I started tracking even more carefully, making sure I was weighing everything.

Three weeks later, the weight on the scale still hasn't moved.

Dr. Google tells me it could be from water weight from my new IUD and that it should subside after a couple of months.

This happen to anyone else?  I am FRUSTRATED as all heck."
"I caught myself in the mirror, and bawled because of what I accomplished so far TL;DR at the end

I, like many of you, struggled with weight issues nearly my entire life. When I was a kid, I was decently fit until around the 2nd grade, where I began to have some slight health issues. Due to my allergies, my doctor recommended to my parents steroids to help accelerate my growth in hopes to phase out my allergies. As a result, I gained a massive amount of weight (and height) extremely quickly. After that, I excepted myself as the ""fat guy,"" and it destroyed my self-image throughout public school and a good chunk of college. I consistent told myself ""I'm just not a skinny guy,"" ""there's nothing wrong with being fat,"" ""I love food to much,"" ""I could lose the weight if I wanted to, but I'm good where I'm at,""
etc.

Then 2019 comes around. I'm at my parents place over fall break, and I go and take a shower. I turned and caught myself in the mirror nude, my immediate gut reaction was one of disgust. You know when you don't intend to see yourself in the mirror, and you do, you have a moment when you don't subconsciously think you're looking at yourself? That happened. I was disgusted of myself. I hated myself. I weighed myself and was 249 pounds. I thought about all the things I've told myself, specifically the ""I could lose the weight if I wanted to"" thought. I wanted to prove that theory, do I have the ability to fix this? This marks the beginning of my weight loss journey.

There's been some ups and downs, but I'm currently 185 pounds and shooting for 175 (well more like 11% body fat). However, I still look at myself and see myself as a fatass. I don't know if I have body dismorphic disorder, but I definitely have symptoms of it.

However, as I'm getting ready to go to bed last night (I sleep shirtless so I'm shirtless in this moment), I caught myself in the mirror right above my dresser. My subconscious didn't realize I was looking at myself, and my gut reaction was one of envy. The lighting highlighted my arms and my stomach, where some slight abs are beginning to develop. It also highlighted my stretch marks on my side, my upper chest, and my profile frame. I viewed myself as sexy, and fucking lost it. I cried so fucking much. It took me like 15 minutes to stop. I'm so happy I've accomplished this, and I'm not even done. I'll never be done after an experience like that.

I want to thank everyone from all the health subreddits (CICO, fasting, 1200isplenty, loseit, progresspics) for a lot of my motivation. I literally have a Reddit account just to view these daily, and the stories a see and read are so damn motivational. I couldn't do it without y'all.

TL;DR Caught myself in the mirror, and thought I was sexy. Never viewed myself like this, cried for 15 minutes."
"trying to figure out my caloric needs... Hi all! I'm hoping to get some advice and possibly some support from anyone in a similar situation :)

First, some stats: I'm F/5'8""/152 lbs.

My goal is to get down to about 140.

I just began training for my first half marathon, and I do strength training a few times a week, along with short daily yoga sessions. My job is fairly active, I work in a mechanics shop so I'm on my feet a good portion of the day. I'm wondering what you guys think my calories should be at? Right now i'm hovering around 1300 but my weight has been stable the past week ... I'm wondering if I should suck it up and go pretty low cal until I hit my goal which isn't SUPER far away.. or if I should just stay in a slight deficit. I'm really motivated right but don't want to wind up binging.

Any women out there with similar stats as me?

Any advice appreciated! Thank you!"
"Three weeks into strength training and diet routine, still not losing any weight. [F25, 5”1, 165 pounds] About three weeks ago I started an exercise program with a personal trainer, three times a week. I also changed over to the paleo diet, I completely cut out all dairy, processed carbs, and added sugars.

To give you a rough idea of where I was at before this, I was eating McDonalds and pizza multiple times a week. I have completely overhauled my diet, I mostly eat protein and veg with some brown rice. My sweets currently consist of Larabars and “ice cream” made from frozen bananas and fruit. 

I’m doing everything right, I’m not cheating. But in three weeks I’ve barely seen any movement on the scale. My trainer tells me not to think about it but it’s hard not to. I have lost about 1 inch in my bust and in my belly.

I’m just looking for advice on how to get my weight loss going. Is this due to all the exercise I’ve been doing? Advise/tips appreciated"
"Losing weight is frightening me Hi, this is my first post on r/loseit. I have been keeping up with posts here for some time and I noticed that many posts involve extreme weight loss journeys.

For me, I only moved from one healthy weight to another. However, the change was still quite drastic and this has been very stressful for me. 

Recently, I put on weight due to exam stress and hit a BMI of 22, which is still healthy, but considered not ideal in Asian society, especially where I live. 

Hence, to motivate myself to lose weight, I watched videos of morbidly obese people eating. At that time, I was really quite anxious about my body and didn't really think about the long term consequences. 

Watching obese people eat junk food triggered a strange gag reflex in me that caused me to quit snacking. Due to this shortfall, I run calorie deficits almost 5 days a week.

My weight has been plummeting (down 7kg/15pounds in 3 months). I am currently at a healthy weight (BMI 20), which I am quite happy with. Even though most Asian beauty standards expect me to be even more skinny (which would make me severely underweight), I do wish to stay healthy and stop losing weight. 

However, I can't stop my weight loss because I have become quite used to my calorie deficits. Also, I recently watched ""To The Bone"" on Netflix and now feeling skinny makes me unbearably stressed. 

Just today, I lay down on the floor to rest, which was quite comfortable when I had more fat on my body. Now, it hurts a bit because my pelvic bones stick out more. I immediately got reminded of eating disorders and this made me panic and worry about my body, even though I am still healthy. 

I really would like to stop worrying about my body and just live normally. There is just so much input from the media (since eating disorders and body-positivity are being more widely discussed now, which is a very good development. I have nothing against it)

However, due to all this buzz, I find myself worrying about being over/underweight. How can I stop panicking about obesity/eating disorders?"
"Noticing a physical change but the scale won't budge -- what am I doing wrong? Ok so, I've been working out pretty consistently over the last 2.5 months. My workouts consist of a couple HIT videos on YouTube (targeting my core specifically), and I workout on average 4-5 days a week. I've noticed some changes, feel more toned in my stomach and legs but today I decided to weigh myself for the first time in a while and now I've lost all my motivation. I've actually gained a couple pounds from the last time!!

For the most part, I've significantly reduced my portion sizes when eating and drink a TON of water daily. The only time I kinda slip from this routine is when I'm on my period (which is fair imo) but besides this I'm pretty consistent. 

I've been avoiding the scale for a while since I started working out in January which I think is why I was so shocked today when I finally weighed myself. I've been keeping progress in terms of inches lost which has been way more motivating for me than the scale has ever been. My question is this: should I be focused on the scale in this process? Can I be satisfied with my results if this isn't translating to significant reductions in my actual weight? Any advice is welcome, it's my first time posting on here :)"
"What am I doing wrong? Make it make sense...

I bought a treadmill in January to help me get myself in shape and to try to “tone up” before summer. I am hell bent to feel more confident in a swimsuit than I did LAST summer so I’m pretty motivated. 

I’m a 5’7” 36 yo female, 202 lbs, 40” hips, 38” waist. I wear a size 10/12 in jeans. 

Anyway, I’m running a 5k on the treadmill about 5 days a week now and also some light weight training to tone my arms up too. I drink a lot of water every day and a low calorie protein drink after I exercise in the mornings while I’m getting ready for work. I have been logging most of my meals on MyFitnessPal but I have a history of an eating disorder and meticulously tracking food can easily send me down the eating disorder rabbit hole, so I just try to track most of the time and I seem to carry a slight caloric deficit. All things considered, I should be losing weight. However, I haven’t gained or lost a single pound or inch. 

I have Hashimoto’s thyroid disease and PCOS that might account for difficulty losing weight but they’re both managed well right now so I can’t blame the lack of progress on those. Where am I going wrong? I’m seeing a lot of benefits in my cardiovascular fitness which continues to make exercise worthwhile but I just feel like I should be seeing SOMETHING even slightly noticeable somewhere on my body. My loved ones have given me honest feedback that they don’t see any change and that they see me every single day and that’s likely why. I saw a friend of mine after not seeing her in months and she said I looked the same. I know not to expect miracles but I do think after a couple of months that I should be able to see some minuscule indication of change. It really brings me down sometimes. I bought a Peloton to change things up a bit. It will be delivered in late April.  

Any feedback or advice is greatly appreciated!"
"Help me spread calories out more evenly across the day 33/f/69kg. Also vegetarian. 

I've been at this a month with about a 600 cal defecit (so says Libra). This is 1200cal/day.

Let me start with the fact that I hate cooking. If the options are for me to roast a red pepper or eat it raw, you best believe I'm eating it raw. I usually eat my biggest meal of the day at dinner, and because I hate cooking, and planning to cook, like to leave calories ""in the bank"" so I can eat whatever I feel like making. 

I'm also short on time during the day (meetings throughout lunch time while wfh). That means though that my lunches tend to be very light (today, red and green peppers, plum tomatoes, beetroot hummus) and then by 5:30, I'm feeling hangry and even less up to cooking.

Any advice for how to manage the calorie-hoarding approach?"
"Simple things for a vegetarian to eat to lose weight? I am a vegetarian without a sense of smell and a minimal sense of taste, so food being ""good"" doesn't really matter to me; I just want it to be quick.

Currently, I eat mostly rice and beans, home fries, and pasta, as those are simple things I know how to quickly cook that I know will make me full.

I want to make my diet healthier to lose weight, but I have no idea what to cook. All healthy recipes have like 10 billion ingredients and look like so much effort; I just want something like ""Put x on the stove, wait 10 minutes, eat food.""

Any ideas for what to eat?

&amp;#x200B;

Ps. Not sure if it matters, but I do all my grocery shopping through imperfect foods. I am also 6 foot 7."
"I didn’t think cutting out sweets would be so hard !! For lent I decided to give up sweets like cookies, cakes, pastries, and chocolate. I have a sweet tooth always knew that don’t judge!!! Four years ago I was over 300lbs and I was down on myself but also realized I had to do something so July of 2016 I went on a diet and lost weight. But like many of you know sometimes the easy part is to take it off but the hard part is to not gain it back. Always struggled keeping it off I would lose the weight and gain it back. So these past years I kept it off I’m happy to say I weigh 245 today. The reason I bring this up is I keep craving sweets in the morning and at night I never realized how addicted I am to sweets or sugar. It’s been hard to say no but I been doing it. Sugar is addicting and bad for us and I think that is what has been holding me down. I’m not sure but I may need to quit sugar for good."
"Ate too much, didn't worry. I (15M) have been losing weight since September

Nov– -9

Dec– -9

Jan– -6

Feb- -9

And yesterday I felt super weird, it was one of those days where you feel like you're dreaming for the whole day, I had some bad beans (literally) and felt sick, later that day I ate a pack of peanuts, needless to say I was shocked when I saw the pack was 800 calories on total, that means I had eaten 2400 calories compared to my fasting 1500-1700 and thankfully didn't worry, I just went to sleep knowing I had just gone ⅓ steps back and it would all be gone 2-4 days, kinda nice to simply not worry, not stressing over ""OMG I ate too much im gonna get fat again!"" Did you ever have that phase of dumb weight loss logic?"
"It may be a bit of hubris but I like to think it was because of me [MFP Update] I don't know if any of you remember this post [MFP Update Idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ih6ytl/sent_mfp_a_feature_idea/)

&amp;#x200B;

I just recently updated MFP on my phone and when I go over my calories it's no longer red but a neutral black!

Most likely that is not because I sent them an email a couple of months ago but I still like to think that lol

But even though it has only been a couple of days, for me it already is a positive change. If I don't stay under my calorie goal I don't immediately feel ""punished"" by the red numbers. It really makes it easier to just stop snacking instead of thinking: ""Well, I'm already in the red, so what difference makes a bit more?""

&amp;#x200B;

For those who downloaded that update too: Do you feel the same? I'm really wondering if this change will make a difference in the long run."
"i'm obese! hi! i'm pepper and i'm obese. i've been admiring the hard work and results of everyone on this subreddit for a pretty long time, so i finally decided to join!

i've been overweight and dealing with weight loss my whole life. in 2018, i lost a lot of weight. at that point, it was the lowest weight i've ever been. i was getting compliments from everyone, which obviously made me really happy. despite this, i still hated myself. i hated the way i was shaped and the way i looked in general, and people around me still continued to body shame me.

fast forward to 2020 and i gained everything i lost. in fact, i gained 25kg. 

currently, i'm at the heaviest weight i've ever been and i'm miserable. i never stop thinking about food or my weight, it's exhausting. i'm tired of people not respecting me and treating me differently because of my weight. i hate that i'm ashamed to go outside and can't wear clothes that i like.

at this point, i don't really believe in myself anymore, i feel like i won't be able to lose weight, but i guess i have to try once more. i don't want to let a food addiction and laziness win.

the reason why i'm writing this post is just to motivate myself and find some support and advice that i really need. how do i work on my food addiction and find the strength to keep going?"
"best way to lose 20 kg? hey, I was wondering if people could give me some tips and tricks on how to lose weight. I stepped on the scale today and i was quite shocked to see 95kg on the display (I'm only 1,75m!). Its one of my biggest things i dont like about myself and I'm done not being able to fit any pants or my old medium sized tshirts. its time for action.

To give you some context, I'm a 26 year old male that has zero to none physical exercise during a normal work week (i sit behind a computer all day for work, especially during these covid times) and I eat quite a lot of take-out food when hanging with friends.

I did some research and I've been 8-16 fasting for quite a while now and watching my calories intake as far as im able to, but this alone doesn't do much of course, so i wanna start running at least 3 times a week (maybe around 4km a run) but I'm a complete noob when it comes to losing weight or researching my food.

i feel kinda insecure about running during the day (and i also absolutely despise going to the gym, for the same reason i guess) so i used to run at night, but me and my family moved to a different city and due to Covid there's now curfew. I have a hard time starting again for I'm the kind of person that likes to run from his problems instead of fixing them. its one of my biggest flaws and im getting tired of myself.

Do any of you guys have tips on how to start losing weight? Are there any diets i could do or smart lifestyle choices i can make to make it a little easier? i know there's  no easy way to do this and losing weight simply requires hard work an discipline but i was still curious to see what other people would say. sorry for the long post, but i felt like giving some extra context.

TL;DR: Do any of you guys have tips for a 26 year old, 95kg, shut in on how to start losing weight?"
"Beginner looking for running alternative So I started a c25k and just began my second week. I am way overweight at 260lbs and 6' tall, at one time I was in great shape and could run no problems. However after letting myself get so out of shape when I started running I am experiencing some issues that are new to me. The last 2 times I have gone and ran I ended up with what I am thinking is runners knee, the first time it was pretty minor, I rested it friday and all weekend and went for my first run this week yesterday. I am back to hurting pretty good and dont want to make it worse, I also dont want to sit on my butt and not lose any weight and not get in better cardio shape. 

What are some things I can do until I can run again? I have a bicycle and I am open to body weight training. I have thought about some sort of HITT routine but am completely unsure of where to start.

Edit: Should mention I am doing CICO currently, and I have a history with knees as I tore the ACL and Meniscus in both knees nearly 20 years ago."
"Gaibed 50 pounds since COVID started. 29f 190lbs Working at home, eating takeout all the time, not being able to go to the gym, drinking alcohol almost every night- it has all caught up to me.

I'm depressed to see how much I've gained. I know this is going to be a long journey for me. I've always struggled with my weight. I was bulimic for several years and it took a long time to accept my body at a ""normal"" weight. I had gone from 100lbs to 140lbs since recovery and finally felt okay. Now that I've gained so much weight over the last year, it's hard not to think of old unhealthy habits.

I worked out for the first time in a LONG time yesterday and could barely do anything without my heart rate hitting 140-160. I know it will take time to get fit again but its a harsh reality to feel so out if shape.

How do you all stay motivated? I want to stay determined and motivated. I feel like just writing this out helps keep me in the right mindset at least, but I know this is going to be hard."
"What A Difference 1lb makes! (No longer obese) https://imgur.com/gallery/WtVuAxI

Hey All! Long post ahead. 

I am currently 180lbs (81.65 kg) and am 5’6” (167.6cm), 24F. My starting weight was 240lbs back in June 2017 (I gained the freshman 50 in college) and lost a total of 50lbs in 5 months starting off! I did this by increasing exercise, counting my calories and learning about nutrition. During 2018-2019 I ate mostly keto which I found did not work for me losing weight but instead I maintained.
Fast forward to 2020 I was pregnant and went back up to 230lbs. Since having my baby TWO months ago I have officially lost ALL of the baby weight AND an additional 10lbs!! 
I achieved this by: 
1. counting my calories (again lol)
2. Incorporating protein bars/shakes for my sweet tooth 
3. Aiming to workout for 1 hour a day (lifting or YouTube HIIT)

What I have learned thus far:
1. Focus on one day at a time, I DO NOT think about tomorrow’s workout until tomorrow
2. Get it done first and focus on excuses later (mind trick: there will be none because it’s already been done)
3. Find motivation when you feel all hope is lost, because that time WILL come and you HAVE to be prepared for it

This journey has been LITERALLY filled with ups and downs especially with a new addition to my family but that’s apart of life. This community has been a GAME CHANGER for my motivation!! 

Don’t give up hope because although you may think the finish line is far away, every day you decide to make the right decisions for you and your body, you’re that much closer."
"Please help! What are some reasons that weight fluctuates if you are in a calorie deficit? Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm posting on here because I'm incredibly frustrated and don't want to stray away from my goals. I have lost 60 pounds since November through a pretty intense calorie deficit and becoming more active. My SW was 292 pounds and I'm down to 233 today. I'm a researcher and naturally very drawn to data and trends. I have been tracking my weight loss to make sure it's healthy and sustainable and also to make sure that what I'm doing is working. I watch my calorie intake and sodium intake because I know that seeing varying numbers frustrates me. 

12 days ago I tested positive for COVID-19. I isolated in a hotel for 10 days through a program NYC has and was unable to leave the room, and had 3 meals a day provided to me. I ended up getting to my lowest weight during this stay, 231.6 pounds. I had a cheat meal the day before I left isolation, then got back to my apartment and immediately restarted my morning walks and cooking healthy meals. I noticed that the day after my cheat meal, I gained weight (which was expected.) The day after that, my weight went up again, even though I was chugging water and watching my sodium and calories. The next day my weight dropped a bit, and today, my weight again went up despite watching my calories and sodium. 

I've been told that a possible reason this is happening is because I'm gaining back muscle mass after being bed ridden for 10 days, and also that weight fluctuations of 1-2 pounds are normal. Is that true? I know this may sound irrational to be thinking about so intensely, but I rely on trends and numbers to show me that what I'm doing is working. What may be the reason that my weight is fluctuating up and down 1-2 pounds daily? Is there any way to ensure that doesn't happen?"
"Workout Partner in Charlotte,NC Hello,

My name is Aaron and I’m looking for a workout partner in Charlotte, NC.  I am a 6’3 male if that matters.  I’m looking for someone who is willing to consistently go with me in the mornings.  I would like someone who is willing to commit at least 3 days M-F for about an hour.  I prefer we start around 5:30-6am but I am flexible to start as late as 7am.  We would be going to the Y.  I prefer the Childress Klein because it is not crowded so we would be able to get through workouts efficiently but we can talk about location.

I realized that it is easier to make excuses at times if I go by myself.  Having another person(s) makes it more difficult since you have someone else counting on you.  Plus it just more fun and enjoyable to share your progress with someone else.

If you are interested please message me and we can make a schedule"
"Here are the lessons I've learned (many from you all) about the psychologically of overcoming fat as a defense mechanism. Being thinner doesn't make me frail, weak, or vulnerable.
Being fat did not make me strong or safe.
My resilience does not lie in my skin, but in my heart.


Through being fat, I learned to detach my self-worth from others' opinions of my body.
I can keep doing that when I'm thin.

Through being fat, I learned that your body has no true bearing on your lovability.
Someone out there can love you at any size.
At any size, it is my choice to let them in.


Through being fat, I've seen that there's more to me than my appearance.
All the good qualities that I relied on to be likable when I was fat
still exist when I am smaller.


Being thin does not make me more subjected to toxic relationships or harmful self-talk.
My decisions do.


Through being fat and alone, I learned how to self-soothe
and depend on myself for joy and companionship.
I can keep doing that when I'm thin.


Shrinking back into an older, smaller size of body
is not an excuse for slipping into old toxic ways of thinking.


All the things I learned from being fat are still my lessons to hold.
At any size, I am still me."
"Lost roughly 40 pounds but still fat... 21F, 5’6, SW:224, CW: 185, GW:165

I’ve been losing weight since March of last year. Quarantine started my weight loss journey and really allowed me the time to think about healthy habits, what I wanted my future to look like, how I wanted to improve my Heath, etc. 

But what no one told me about weight lost is that after you lose the weight, you still think you’re fat. Someone has to feel this way too. Everyone has told me how different I look, I see old photos and am literally shocked, and even my sister(if you have a sister you understand) told me I looked good. Yet I still find myself wearing XL sweaters, I avoid walking in narrow places because I think I won’t fit, several of my friends have mentioned how I talk about myself as if I still think I’m 224 pounds. College boys talk to me now, THEY FLIRT WITH ME. I HAVE BEEN ASKED ON DATES. Not that I need their validation, but I’m flabbergasted college boys find me attractive now. Also kind of sad because like it took losing weight for people to notice how awesome I am. 
It’s also weird because I’m not at my goal weight. I’m not considered healthy yet. Yes, I feel great and am content with how I look, but I’m still overweight. 

I am aware I’ve lost weight. I know that I look better now. But sometimes, I really have to remind myself that I look different, that fat jokes are no longer appropriate for me to make, and that I’m not at my goal yet. Does anyone else struggle with this?"
"I need help. Hello everyone, I'm new to this subreddit so excuse me if I do anything wrong. I'm a 1.78cm, 121 kilos male and I can't seem to lose weight and I really don't know what to do about it. It's been 2 months that I started this journey, I am doing a low carb diet with mostly whole foods and generally mostly vegetables with plenty of protein both plant based and animal based, with no cheat days and no slips (so far), maxing out at 1500cal daily. I wake up at 9am, make a black coffee and head to the treadmill, I do 10 minutes walking, 10 minutes running and 20 minutes walking on a maxed out incline which I noticed burns the most calories (according to the treadmill) and after that 30 minutes of different kinds of cardio, either shadow boxing, push ups, crunches, burpees etc. I know it's still early and I shouldn't expect visible changes yet, but the scale feels like it's stuck at 121 and even though I'm motivated to work harder and try harder, it's very demotivating to not be able to track any kind of progress. Please ask any question you want or recommend anything, I'll be happy to read all the comments and reply."
"I 26F just need a place to share my epiphany about my weight gain Hi everyone.

I am 26f I stand at 164cm tall (5ft4in)
Current weight: 123kg (272lbs)
Goal weight: 55 (121lbs)
Weight to lose: 68 (150lbs)

I am currently considered morbidly obese. 

TL:DR it's my fault I got this big. 

I bit of backstory. I grew up in a family where none of the women were happy with their bodies, everyone was either on a diet or starting a diet and talked constantly about losing weight whilst most of them were overweight if not obese themselves.. so I already started to have body image issues from a young age. 

Due to that I developed disordered eating and then later in life to cope with my abusive upbringing I developed an eating disorders at 14. I have been overweight since I was 12 and obese from 17. I can't remember a time I was a healthy weight.

But I have also always talked about losing weight, even before I was 14 but I have always kept putting weight on. It doesn't help that I quit smoking 3 years ago so I out in weight then. 

The problem with my weight though, is that my pride and ego refuses to accept that it is in anyway my fault. I have gone from doctor to doctor to have every test possible to make sure I am not unwell and that's why I am getting bigger, and when I get told I am perfectly healthy I just get angry. Or blaming medication for my weight gain when it's really only been when I am on anti depressents that my weight has been stable. 

And with all that, I am the heaviest I have ever been. Over the last year I have received help (health, trauma etc) where necessary and feel much better about the prospects of losing weight. 

But for some reason I was getting bigger, well it must be something else making me fat...WRONG!

My bank account is currently over drawn, I borrowed money off a friend to make it to pay day, I used vouchers to buy groceries.. but where did all my money go. Well? Takeaway. 

I have an addiction to takeaway, I mean how else do you keep putting on weight when all people see is you eating healthy home cooked meals, even though I am to ashamed to admit I buy takeaway every other day. I recognised these addict behaviours this week, they remind me of what I was like when I used to smoke. 
And my pride and ego took a hit as I was forced to accept my addiction and the role I have played in my own weight gain, I could no longer lie to myself, it was set in stone. 

But I feel encouraged, no more lying to myself. No more playing the victim. I am obese from my own doing, and I'll become healthy by my own doing. 

I think I now can tackle this weigh loss journey. I have some fears and hesitation (but that's for another post), but with the right support network. I'll get through this. 

Any tips and tricks would be wonderful."
"Weight loss in recovery I started my current serious efforts at weight loss about a year and a half ago, I'm still down about 80 pounds from my original starting weight, which is great, I know, but originally I had lost about 120 pounds.

I've been clean and sober for a little over 3 years now. LOOKING FOR KUDOS IS NOT WHAT THIS POST IS ABOUT. I dont know how many others on this subreddit are also in recovery or have dealt with people in recovery, but us addicts LOVE instant gratification, which is not a good thing for weight loss. 

I've found that in working towards gaining control in my substance abuse habits, I'm losing control in my eating habits. Has anyone else come across this phenomenon? Any tips or pointers? 

Thank you to this sub, its really nice to have somewhere to talk about this stuff."
"Depressed, tired, worried, and ashamed Hey guys. I made a post about a year ago, taking accountability and being fed up with my lifestyle. And I made a change. I did good for a while, lost weight, blood work was great. Was on the right track. I than got hit by money issues 2020 gave everyone. The year that kept giving. I gave up.

Here I am back to my heaviest weight, older, and feeling terrible physically. I have to roll off the couch, I always feel weak and shaky. My lowest point was last night I decided to do some sit-ups and crunches... I couldn’t do one.

I don’t know if my belly’s in the way, or my core is that weak. I do have some weird neuro issues for a while that I’m seeing a specialist about March 29. My muscles spasm and twitch a lot when contracting certain groups. Seems like severe weakness.

Has anyone been to the point of barely being able to do sit-ups, push-ups. Ect? How did you start strength training, and how long till you noticed strength gains. Idc about looking strong or anything. I just want to be able to not feel like I need a crane to walk"
"Losing weight with an ED recovering partner 


cw: mentions of weight, dieting, and eating disorders

TLDR; I want to eat better and lose weight, but my girlfriend is recovering from anorexia and we eat most of our meals together. I’m scared that my diet change will affect the way she eats and cause a relapse.


I’m (20F) currently dating my wonderful girlfriend (21F), and we’ve been together for almost a year. Having been together all throughout various lockdowns, she’s been an amazing support and we’ve grown very close very quickly. One thing we have bonded over is our shared experience of dealing with EDs (anorexia mostly) in our teenage years and ongoing. I was very ill around the ages of 15/16, but have been in recovery since about 17. As of now, I consider myself to be doing really well in my recovery; I’m no longer punishing myself for eating or obsessing over calories etc, I feel like I’m back on track. My girlfriend hasn’t been so lucky; her ED took hold in her later teen years and she has only started recovering since a little before we met. In the last year she has made incredible strides and I am so proud, the difference is incredible and she looks healthy and happy.
However, over lockdown, I’ve put on a bit of weight (as I’m sure many of us have). I’m not punishing myself for it - it’s natural and understandable to gain weight when you’re in a global crisis - but I’ve gotten to the point where I’m quite unhappy. My body has been many shapes and sizes over my life, and in its current state I don’t feel as good or healthy, and I want to get back to a place where I’m happy, which involves losing a bit of weight from eating better.

Now here’s my conundrum: my girlfriend is not as far in her recovery journey as I am. I feel very capable of improving my diet in healthy and sustainable ways without triggering a relapse; however, my girlfriend is not quite there yet. I’m terrified that if I mention my want to get fitter she will follow along with it for the wrong reasons.
We eat almost every meal together, and split our time between my house and hers. When we’re together, we eat great food (she’s a fantastic chef) but it’s not exactly the healthiest meals and that’s contributed a lot to my weight gain. 
I’m not quite sure how to handle this; I don’t want to eat completely separately from her and make her feel like she’s eating the ‘wrong’ thing, but I don’t want to force her to cook healthier meals when she is still pretty underweight and doing really well eating how we are currently.
She also has a habit of adjusting her eating schedule to mine, eg, she won’t eat unless I’m eating, she’ll change her portions to match mine, etc. For these reasons I’m really scared she will match what I’m doing and relapse hard.
Sorry this is so long. Any advice!? I’m really determined to get back to a physical fitness I’m happy with but I’m terrified of risking my girlfriend’s health and happiness."
"Lost of appetite Hello fellow narwhals, I'm currently on my way to my ideal weight (75kg, 165lbs), actually at 122,2kg (268 lbs) and something struck me. I lost my appetite. And I'm a(hun?)ngry about it. I can't eat properly for my workout session cause I don't feel the hunger, as if my body was numb.

I suspect some kind of depression, but I'm not sure, so here I am asking, do any of you know this situation?

Besides that, I'm a 24 male, 1,83cm (6'0""), and I just lost 10kg (22lbs) in a month, which makes me very happy.

I'm just a little worried about my calories in. This week, my calories in were very low (around 300 to 500) and I didnt feel the need to add more, this is why it startled me. Writing that it feels like I'm bragging but I'm really not, thing is, I could probably continue with such low calories in, but since I'm working out in the same time that I'm losing weight, it becomes quite annoying, not to mention dangerous. 

Anyway, thanks for your answers and best of luck and strenght for your journeys!"
"‘Friend’ used me as deplorable fat friend and now im unusable to her I was reading through this Reddit and saw all the support and motivation everyone here gives to one another. It made me realise that one of my friends actually really sucks now that i’ve lost weight. I went from being 165 lbs (75kg) to 110 lbs (50kg) at 5’3 (160cm).

It was clear to me that I always was considered the fat, less attractive friend compared to her, but now that i’ve lost the weight and get more attention, i realise how one of my friends still tries to manipulate me into thinking that it is a privilege that i get to hang out with an ‘attractive’ person like her.

When i’m talking to somebody, she’ll come around and mention how I used to be overweight and still eat like a pig, but she’s covering it as a joke or ‘compliment’. She really used me as the shy and (in her terms) ugly friend to make herself seem better and now that i’m less shy and more confident, she can’t use me anymore for that purpose. 

You guys made me realise that i deserve better than those comments and those people. I hope that, if somebody reads this, you realise that you never ever have to accept this kind of behaviour, regardless where you are in your journey. You are beautiful and deserve happiness; never be dependent on someone that makes you feel shit to uplift themselves.

EDIT: omg thanks for the support and the Hugz award!! It’s my first award on Reddit and i love how it’s on a post where you all are SO nice to me. Sending love !!

EDIT 2: thank you all so much for the support!! didn’t expect this at all but it shows how great of a community you are to me, thank you 💕"
"Weight loss/accountability buddy? So the title says it all really, I’m sure this has been posted here 100 times before so sorry for another post about it! 

I’m looking for someone who’s interested in helping each other stay accountable, daily chats or check ins via WhatsApp kinda thing. I’ve been trying to lose weight for years now and keep losing the same 30 odd lbs and then gaining it back plus some so I really want to try and hold myself to it this time. Would love to chat to someone with similar goals/interests. 

For reference I’m 25F 198lbs and 5”5 aiming to be around 130lbs and I’m doing 10,000 steps and CICO. 

Also a book lover, cat lady, love crafts and a bit of a nerd if that helps!"
"Having a hard time getting back on track and need advice Hello! I've been reading here for a long time, and have really valued all of the discussions on this subreddit. Thank you all for them, and hopefully thank you in advance for any advice you can offer!

Some background: I started CICO and consciously trying to lose weight in a healthy way in late 2017. I achieved my goal weight in the winter of 2018/2019 after a bought of mononucleosis ""helped"" me drop the last 6 or so kilos I was trying to lose, but lost the first 25kg exclusively through CICO. From there, I managed to maintain my weight for a few years, usually fluctuating between 82 and 85kg. This was kind of a stroke of luck, because I didn't really track and have had, in general, a very hard time continuously tracking over long periods of time. 

Over the last 8 or so months, though, I've gained back around 10kg. I could tell I was eating differently and could tell I was gaining weight from how my clothes started to fit differently, but I couldn't manage to track consistently and would fall off the wagon after a week or so of tracking and feeling good about doing so. Now, all of my clothes feel bad on me and I am just uncomfortable in my own skin. Most of all, I'm terrified of gaining back all the weight I had lost and having to lose it all yet again. I'm trying so hard to track my food and eat well, but I can't seem to do it consistently and can ruin an entire week of tracking in one night. I really want to just get back to where I was, even if I wanted to lose more at that point, and I just don't know how or what I'm missing to do so. 

If anyone has any advice on how to get back on track with eating well and doing CICO, I would really appreciate it! I'm sorry if this whole thing is a bit of a mess to read; I feel like I'm at a tipping point and am desperate not to fall to the wrong side."
"Fast food question, So i've been working out since I was in the 7th grade, both doing muscle training and soccer but I have never been able to remove this stubborn fat from my belly region and love handles. Granted, it's not excessive but it's still always there.

Anyway anyway, basically I've been eating fast food on the weekends with my family for a very long time now and was wondering if that has been the main issue? I eat pretty clean and exercise near daily but on the weekends my family for saturday gets pepperoni pizza, then the next day we eat take out from ihop OR mcdonalds. Then for dinner usually something from burger king or mcdonalds if we got ihop food. Then monday I eat pizza left overs for dinner and for lunch another mcdonalds burger, since I usually get the double burger combo but save the extra burger for the next day. I also get fries for both lunch and dinner every sunday. I also don't drink normal soda but medium diet soda instead and only on sunday, 2 if I got mcdonalds for lunch.

You know reading this out loud I'm realizing how fucking stupid I've been oh my god. I feel like such a dumbass lmao I've studied so hard into diet for more than 8 years on my own and I didn't even realize what I was doing. Well still, can anyone help confirm my suspicions that eating like that weekly is definitely contributing to my struggles with weight loss? Like I said I eat only 3 meals a day, drink plenty of water and do exercise almost daily. Also sorry if it's kinda hard to read what I typed I should've been asleep like 2 hours ago LOL okay thank you for any help."
"I am unable to loose any weight . Not even a single gram.. I am maintaining strict diet since last one week.. Eating healthy food.. No processed food or outside food.. Cooked healthy food.. 

I do exercise everyday now.. 70 squats, 50 lunges, 100 jumping jocks and some stuff... 

I checked my weight just now.. I didn't even loose a single gram... Not even one gram... I am exactly the same weight before.. Diet, exercise and healthy life didn't even help loosing 1lb. 

I am loosing hope.. People are loosing weight like everyday, why is it so impossible for me... I didn't drink or smoke either.. Even a 100grams would have motivated to continue... 

I am scared I won't ever be able to loose this weight and will be over weight forever..."
"Owning up So I have been on quite a journey and found that diet change instead of exercise was the key to my weight loss. I lost 32kg and felt amazing.. it put me from XXL to M/L size clothes and lowered my BMI from morbidly obese to overweight. 
Lockdown was not a major hindrance and although weight loss stalled as my lunch walks stopped and I snacked more, I didn’t gain weight despite the extra stress etc.

However the past 3 months I have been working overseas, on a short term contract, and was stuck in isolation for several weeks at a time. During this period, they provided food at very prescribed times. I have found that this makes me eat more food than when not pressed, as a way of preventing hunger pangs between these times. I am angry at myself as I know I can intermittently fast for several meals at a time so why does this bother me so much! 

Now that work has finally ended and I go home shortly , I’ve taken stock, and fear I am as much as 8lb more than when I arrived in December. So I now face a challenge of restarting weight loss rather than weight maintenance when I get home.

This post is meant as a reflection for myself to accept this failure but put it behind me and move forwards with what I know needs to be done rather than look at it as an all consuming defeat. 

Is is also a reminder to others that a miss step on the path doesn’t stop you getting up and continuing the journey."
"Just realised I'm halfway! So I was editing my user flair, and realised that after 7 months of CICO and building up my running from C25K to 5 days a week from 5-10 miles, I'm now exactly halfway on my journey. 

I've always Yo-Yoed but have been in the high 200s for years. Lockdown 1 pushed me to my heaviest ever at 330lbs and I knew I had to do something about it for good, especially as I'm over 40 and would like to see my 3-year-old grow up.

I started C25K - I've always been a runner but at that weight I had to reboot - and Re-downloaded Myfitnesspal.

And I haven't looked back! The weight fell off in the first weeks and I felt great, then the losses started to slow down. In the past, this is where I've given up because it hasn't felt as rewarding, but this time I pushed through.

I had a blip in December because I caught covid so couldn't run plus all the Christmas food but again I managed to push through in spite of gaining, which I haven't managed to do in the past.

And so today, as I edited my user flair, I realised I'd lost 74lbs (256lbs) with another 74lbs to go to my target of 182lbs. Which also made me realise that if I've done it once I can do it again. I've literally never felt more motivated to lose weight and I just wanted to share that to hopefully encourage others who face a lot of false starts as I have.

(Plus an NSV - I can now open a packet of biscuits, eat two and *put the rest back*! Never thought I'd see the day!)"
"Went to the gym alone for the first time today! I started going to the gym a few weeks ago with my friend. That was a pretty big step in and of itself since I’m not very active at all. I’m also not very self disciplined so I needed someone to hold me accountable. I was also scared to go because I didn’t know what I was doing and had all of the nerves of “what will people think when they see me trying to figure out what a machine does??” (Yeah I know, nobody cares) 

Today I went by myself!! And I felt confident all through it and even hit a leg press PR and was able to push myself to keep going even after I didn’t want to. My weight loss journey is slow but it’s cool to see these type of achievements culminate :)"
"Comments about my weight loss are making me incredibly uncomfortable This might not be the right place. for this but it’s been on my mind snd idk where else to post this...

My (23F) staring weight was 270 at 5’10. 

I didn’t hate how i looked at my starting weight and have always been confident in my body and was able to feel good even at my largest. I’m losing weight because i want to be healthy and i want to avoid the afflictions of some of my family members...

Ive lost a total of approx 35lbs in 6 months (including regaining about 10 during the holidays) and people will not stop commenting on my body. 

I dont see too many people because of covid but I recently went to my partners parents house after they’ve been fully vaccinated and his mom kept talking about how much better i looked and how I should’ve done it sooner and she can’t wait to see me once i’ve lost all the weight, etc. She would also use me as an example that my partner also needed to lose weight and basically called him ugly and said he could look so much better if he lost weight “since I was able to do it. “

I’m conflicted because i am proud of the work i’ve put in but they way they describe it just makes me so sad. I wasn’t ugly before and i don’t really look “better” i just look a bit different. The way they’re congratulating my weight loss and making fun of my partner for not losing weight makes me feel like they saw me as a less than human person before i started losing weight.  

I always knew i was treated different/worse for being fat but I guess it’s kinda jarring to see people be so open about it. 

I knew with losing weight that people would notice and probably comment but this just makes me feel sad and gross and i really really hope that comments like this aren’t the norm when you lose weight."
"Losing weight without obsessing about it? I feel as though every time I begin losing weight, I think about dieting to the point of obsession almost. I'm not undereating, but I just can't stop thinking about what kind of food to cook/eat, watching ""what I eat in a day"" videos, etc. I'm not even hungry while I do this, it's almost like a stress/anxiety response. I wish I could just eat the food I eat without having to think so much as well. 

It's not hard sticking to the calorie deficit necessarily, it's just the mental effort of thinking about it all the time that makes it exhausting. When I'm not in a deficit I'm able to eat intuitively without gaining weight, I haven't binged in years, and I try not to restrict too low, I just wish I could turn off my brain.

Since I've only been actively losing for about a month, I am wondering if anyone has advice about going from the ""this is new and requires effort"" mentality to ""this is just my life now"""
"Feeling good It looks like I've finally gotten out of the obesity zone. I plan on weighing myself on Thursday. 

My belly looks so much smaller, it kinda feels like I've lost a part of myself lol. Hopefully I can knock off the next 50lbs without much issue.  I just landed a new job and I'm praying that my new work schedule doesn't interfere with my current gym routine. 

I recently found a video of myself from last May, a month before the gyms opened back up, I was happy to see how much I've changed and persisted through out 2020. I was cool with my hair and beard looking crazy back then, but now I put more thought into my appearance. 

My former self in the video feels foreign to me now. It's wild to see how much compassion and love I lacked for myself."
"A MASSIVE (but tiny) NSV So i started an internship back in mid September where they truly care about their interns. I have a mentor who i’ve been seeing once a week for the past six months.

"How do you guys avoid compulsive eating? Currently trying to lose weight. Not sure of an exact goal, but definitely trying to drop as much weight as possible before October 1st.

Anyways, found a exercise routine I'm happy with,  I just can't stop eating garbage. I eat when I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm stressed, when I'm bored. I just feel the need to snack or eat almost every 3hrs it feels like. I usually feel shitty after doing do as well. I know that with exercise you increase metabolic rate and may feel hungrier than usual, but this has been occurring even before weight loss. Could this be some sort of compulsive eating disorder? 

I've made the effort to replace the cookie and ice cream snacks with fruit and trail mix, but that's still a ton of sugar in fruit and the calories in trail mix add up quick. I try eating ice sometimes to get that ""snacking feeling"", but that's bad for your teeth. 

What things do you guys do to avoid eating garbage while trying to lose weight, especially at the beginning of weight loss."
"I need some direction Im 24 and I stand tall at 6' 6"" I've been eating a little too much recently. I told myself that it's okay I'm big I require a lot more food but today I learned I'm bordering 300lbs. My family has issue's with weight loss and overeating so I want to get control of this before it's too late.

I have been walking and my job is super active for roughly 9 hours a day (and once the weather warms up I'll go jogging) so exercise isn't too much of a problem. 

The issue is dieting, I was told that keto works and then a week later was told that keto is fake. Same with Vegan, Meateater, and Atkins. I'm just receiving so many mixed messages on what I should eat. If anyone has a direction or maybe even some definite NOs, any help would be appreciated. I'm also allergic to eggs."
