"Does sleeping/waking up at later hours affect gains? 20 years old and male, started exercising in earnest in January after being skinny my whole life. My situation is that I get 7-9+ hours of sleep every night, but at some pretty fucked hours. I tend to go to sleep pretty late (2-3am, sometimes even later) and wake up around noon (the move to virtual/asynchronous university classes has made it easy to stay on top of work while sleeping in most days, living at home). I've been fairly consistent with eating 3000+ calories everyday for the last few weeks (up from the 2000-2500 average I was hitting in the first few weeks), but I'm wondering if the loss of those morning hours is hindering the benefits I get from my diet and exercise, since I eat my last meal/snack by around 11pm or midnight anyway. People I know usually tend to start their meals in the afternoon only when they're intermittently fasting, which I'm not officially doing. I know it's generally a good idea to sleep and wake up earlier in the day, but I'm still curious about the effect of sleep timing, since most fitness advice tends to focus on number of hours of sleep, which for me is more than adequate."
"I'm meeting my caloric intake goals, but my macros arent balanced like they should be. How will this affect my gains? Ex. Getting more calories from protein than carbs while still reaching my daily calorie goal. I know 50-60% of your calories should be from carbs, 30% from protein and the remaining from fat, but I've been realizing it's hard to meet that exact ratio of macronutrients everyday. I've been reaching my daily bulk caloric goal of 2,961 calories, but I'll often get more protein than carbs or more carbs and not enough protein on certain days. Will this not make me gain muscle ?"
"Does doing the same workout routine for too long impede gains? Hey everybody,

I’ve been starting my bulking journey about a year ago with this [Reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) workout routine. Overall I’ve been pretty consistent with each workout throughout the year but I heard that doing a workout too many times means that your muscles get used to it and thus stop growing as much?

I’m just a beginner so clarification from a more knowledgeable person could help me out?

Thanks!"

"Moving to Germany as a student. I would like to know cheap food that I could buy that will help me keep gaining weight. (Because I am a student and Ill probably work halftime if possible.) Hello fellow gainers,

So I am moving to germany in one month and I wanted to ask what foods I can buy that are cheap and will help me keep gaining weight. At the moment I am not lifting weights because the pandemic situation but I am kind of enjoying the dad bod that I got from stopping lifting weights.

However I can slowly feel how I am losing weight because I am naturally skinny and if I dont eat enough, I will go back to skeleton me.

I am a male, 29y.o. I used to weight around 90kg when I lifted weights but when the pandemic started I had to stop and now I am at around 82kg and slowly decreasing.

The question is more addresed to people from Germany but obviously anyone can comment. I thank you for your comments."
Anyone else struggle with not being able to eat something that you’re not in the mood for? I can’t seem to force myself to eat food that I’m not in the mood for. Especially if it requires me to cook. Someone help me to stop being a bitch.
"does the body have a limited rate of muscle growth or is it specific to each muscle I'm wondering if the body itself is limited in how many resources it can put towards muscle growth, or if each specific muscle has its own limits and so long as the body is well fed it can maximize the growth of each muscle worked out.

Basically, I want to know if neglecting some areas that don't need as much work will allow my body to ""focus"" more on repairing the fibers in the specific muscle groups that I'm targeting."
"Can I omit an exercise if I’m not making any progress with it? I’ve been doing PPL for 3 months now, and my last raises are still at 6x20 for 10 lbs. they’re super tiresome and I haven’t made any progress with them since my first week. They just feel pointless. Even my OHP is progressing, but lat raises just feel like a wasted effort."
"SUPER HIGH CALORIE bottled beverage brands Hey guys. I've been bulking for the last 2 years straight and have went from mid 160s to between 187-194 lbs. I want to keep this weight as I am a part of my university's powerlifting club and 1) don't want to drop a weight class 2) want to maintain relative strength gains. I, however will be gone for an extended drill with my guard unit for 13 days and for a whole month in the summer for a seperate drill. In total, I would roughly get 3,500 calories in per day. With an already active schedule, I need to take in roughly 4,190 cals a day to maintain my current bodyweight. While on an FTX, I'll need to consume 4,200+ cals to maintain weight. Because of this, I was wondering if any of you know about bottled drinks I could take with me so I can maintain my daily calorie intake. Preferably, the bottled beverages you all might recommend have some protein in them. Thanks in advance. Sorry for the obscure, extremely specific post. I'm genuinely concerned about losing all the recent progress I've made. I'm starting to get close to qualifying for nationals in my weight class and I don't want the army to ruin yet again another thing that brings me joy.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I desperately need bottled beverage recommendations, roughly 500 cals per bottle and with some protein. Will be doing lots of walking/rucking/field stuff in the sun with a lot less food for 13 days and a whole month on 2 separate occasions and don't want to lose weight."
"How long until I can see a difference? I've been eating 3000+ calories and working out regularly for 2 months now and have gained around 12 lbs (5'8 112lbs - 5'8 124lbs). I've made some decent strength gains but I can't notice a different in my physique at all even when comparing to my before pictures. I know that it takes a while, but I've been feeling pretty demotivated knowing that my bmi has gone from 17 to 19 yet I see no difference whatsoever. I don't really care all that much about muscle gains tbh, I just want to not be skinny anymore. I hate being scrawny more than fucking anything. How long will it take for me to be noticeably heavier?"
"Could You Guys Give Me Advice So I Don't Waste My Time? Here Are My Goals and Plan! Guys, I currently am 5,7 148 pounds and 18% body fat. I want to bulk up to 170 pounds, and be around 11% body fat. What is the correct approach in doing this? Will doing some heavy lifting + explosive cardio tone my body down while allowing me to still gain weight? I understand I'll have to be eating at a caloric surplus with lots of protein and low carbs. Any tips you guys got for me or steps I should take. I'm more motivated than ever, I just don't know where to begin."
"Want to try a new split First time poster so sorry if this is in the wrong place. I’ve been doing the 5-day ‘bro split’ for 6 months now and have got a little more time on my hands as of recently. I wanted to switch to a chest/tri, back/bi, legs and shoulders split and wanted to know if this 6 day split sounds good to any seasoned lifters?
Day 1 - chest/tri
Day 2 - back/bi
Day 3 - shoulders
Day 4 - rest
Day 5 - chest/tri
Day 6 - back/bi
Day 7 - legs
Then day 1 would be a rest and so on  

I don’t think I could do a Push day with chest/tri/shoulders cause I’d be too exhausted and not hit each muscle hard enough. Any advice would be greatly appreciated cheers"
"When you do a ‘tricep’ exercise are all muscles in the tricep activated? Similarly for all other muscles groups and exercises.

If I do close grip bench, are all 3 heads in the triceps being worked on a good amount (some more than others) or is one being neglected heavily.

Similarly for biceps, if I do barbell curls are both heads being activated efficiently?

For squats, all in quads? etc"
"How do I not get tired out after 1 exercise (chest day)? Gotten back into lifting after grabbing some adjustable dumbbells and for the first time, decided to try and do a program. Been trying to use https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/6-day-dumbbell-only-workout this one while swapping out excercises here and there, but, specifically on chest day, I get extremely fatigued after one pressing exercise and it makes it difficult to do another, at least with good form. It doesn't really effect my Pull days, but it does impact my legs only because I half ass train them and often skip a day.

I've always been a heavy-as-you-can type of guy, but with dumbbells it seems volume is the better option. If I start off with flat DBs and hit 3x12 then 2x8 or 10 with the same weight (because I tire out), if i try to do Incline/Decline after it I almost physically can't. 

Is it because I'm just not used to the volume? I never really went above 10 reps when it came to chest and before I stopped I often hovered around a 5x5 or max of 8 reps with a barbell. Or am I just supposed to feel like this? I end up only legitimately being able to do 5 sets of chest on a ""push"" day, with the other 3-4 sets being nowhere near the form they should be or the rep range.

I see some people here saying they do Incline, Decline, AND Flat all in the same day and that blows my mind."

"Noob questions regarding shakes Ive viewed the FAQ regarding shake recipes, but I have a few questions about the logistics.




1. Most recipes include whey/whey isolate. Where do I buy whey like this? Most stores around me only carry ON and other big name brands. Are these fine or is there a better choice?




2. Do you guys drink them slowly or finish them in a quick sitting? I could imagine that I would feel like shit if I downed it instantly, but I also don't want to extend it too far that it breaks into times where I should be eating, but now I feel full.





3. Do you guys generally drink one a day (assuming you dont live off them and eat other meals?)




4. Should I consider adding maltodextrin or dextrose, and if so, where would I even get it?



Thank you for the help"
“Doubling up” to make up a day? So today I just didn’t have time for the gym. But tomorrow I’ll have plenty of time. I’m currently following the Reddit PPL routine. Can I do Push day and Leg day on the same day?
"Should cardio also be progressively overloaded if bodybuilding is a priority? My main purpose for cardio is to be healthier and increase my appetite to get more surplus calories.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just not sure if it should also be progressively overloaded? Like for example I do 10min jog every other day, around the same intensity each time. Do I need to increase intensity, frequency, and length when time comes? or am I good just jogging casually with the same intensity for 10mins every cardio session?

&amp;#x200B;

My goal is to reach around mid 50s resting heart rate while also being jacked. Is that healthy or possible? Or will gains be compromised?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: afraid to push because it might comprmise muscle gains, not so sure thats why I asked. Thank you too if you will reply :)"
"Best cheap food for bulking Hey, I am not the best at cooking as I am looking for lunch you can go down and buy at the supermarket for cheap and go home and make. I suck at cooking and I don't really have a lot of time for in. So the things I should buy to cook should be relatively cheap and simple to make, and it shouldn't take to a long time.

"How much eggs do you guys eat a day? I usually have four eggs per day (two eggs per meal). I do that because meat is rather expansive where I live, so I try to have as much protein as I can from eggs, which are way cheaper. And now meat is even more expansive so I'm thinking of cutting down on the meat and supplementing it with two more eggs per meal... so 8 eggs per day.

My friends (and the internet) tell me that is way too much eggs, lol. Do you guys think I'll F up my cholesterol with that many eggs? How much eggs do you have in a day? Egg egg egg egg."

"Healthy bread &amp; wrap alternatives I love eating bread, and I know eating too much is bad for me trying to do a modest cut.  Are there any breads that are actually healthy? Currently eating whole wheat but have heard Dave's Killer Bread and Ezekiel are good. Also when it comes to things like naan or tortilla wraps, are there any healthy brands/alternatives? I've seen some tik tok videos of greek yogurt naan, but does using the normal flour with that make it unhealthy? 

Obviously, most things are fine in moderation, but I eat at least 2-3 slices of bread or 1 slice and a wrap/naan per day. This is in addition to one of sweet potatoes, brown rice, or occasional pasta."
"Help me with my booty gains Hey guys, I'm a girl in my 20s. I weigh 130lbs. Im 5'7"". I'm basically skinny fat. My butt is small but round, just not super muscular and firm. Most of my excess fat is localized in my love handles. It's really not a lot and I look skinny in clothes but I just want to be more muscular. I figure body recomp is probably useless for me because it'll take a lot longer for me to gain muscle and lose the fat.

My TDEE is about 2000 calories (I eat a lot and am always hungry so I guess I have a fast metabolism). So I think I should bulk, at about 100 or 150 caloric surplus. My question is, if I successfully gain muscle during this bulk (for about 3 or 4 months) will I lose the stubborn love handle fat naturally, just as a result of having more muscle (since muscle burns more calories at rest??). 

Also, will I gain a lot of fat during a bulk for this period of time? I don't eat processed food, refined sugar, etc.  I strictly eat paleo with the exception of potatoes to control the symptoms of my autoimmune disease. Lots of protein, lots of greens, etc.   


I've been resistance/weight training 3 days a week and skipping rope for half an hour on the days in between (weekends I rest).

Anything helps! Thanks y'all!"
"Novice trying to run Lyle Mcdonald's bulking routine  Apologies if you've seen this on the fitness sub, I posted but didn't get any replies so I was hoping someone here would help me out

Age: 20, Sex: Male, Height: 5'10, Weight: 135-138 lbs, natural

Experience: Started seriously working out since September 2020, stopped between November till end of Jan due to personal issues. Restarted in Feb in a proper gym and have good form in main lifts such as Bench, OHP, Squart, and DL. In my 3 months or so of serious training I have gained significant progress and people have noted my size difference.

Main goals: Increase size and strength. Mix of hypertrophy and strength. But mostly appreciate aesthetics.

Current Maxes:

Bench: 125 lbs for 3 reps ( can be done for about 3 sets given 2 warmup sets and 2 sets of 115 lbs)

Deadlift: 145 lbs. Can continue to increase, not sure where my limit is but slowly increasing to avoid injury

Squat: 135 lbs. Slowly increasing, can do 3 set of 7 reps given warmup sets and others

Overhead Press: 75 lbs, slowly increasing. Can do 4 sets of 5 with prior warmup

Question regarding LM Bulking Routine:

1. I understand the exercises that are on the program, but I was wondering whether I can modify it to fit my 6 days a week workout schedule. I am also unsure about what weight to use for the workout and how to increase. For example, what should I start with now and how much should I increase per week?
2. I noticed there aren't any ab exercises in this program. I therefore assigned Wednesday's rest day as the designated abs day
3. Stiffleg deadlifts vs regular deadlifts?
4. Any app recommendations to store this program on? I am currently using the Gymshark app. But would appreciate maybe an app that contains a ""weeks"" function and another function that alters your set weights based on new max PRs.

This is my first post on this sub so sorry if I did something wrong. I look forward to any reply!"
"How to come back after a HUGE layoff (~1 year) From August 2019-September 2020 I did little to no consistent training. I went from 230ish to 170 at my lowest. Coming back to training was really hard, and I sympathize with you if you are restarting after losing everything. I want you to know that although you may  THINK have lost all of your muscle and strength gains, they are still there just laying dormant. Years of training results in additional satellite cells being created and etched into your muscles that stick around for *decades*. 

I was 175 when I started back up. The first time I came back to the gym, I was warming up to squat and [fell backwards on my ass almost every set.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEIRK8uA7i-/?igshid=13gd8vqnv96wb) I was so mad at myself and my body. I knew how to squat in my mind, but my body just didn't have the skill anymore, it had to be redeveloped. I wasn't even as close to upset at how little weight I could move compared to actually not being able to squat. Be nice to yourself when you come back, you know how to do it, but you need to be patient with your body as it relearns. 

It has been 6ish months since I have returned to lifting and I have already set lifetime PRs and gained all of the weight I lost back. In fact, I am 245 now and that is also a lifetime PR. Here is what I did the first 2 and half months and my advice for returning to the gym:

**DO NOT test your maxes**

After I realized my body lost a ton of motor patterns, I was so upset, it is such a bad feeling. On top of that, I knew I was weak. To help protect my ego, I refused to learn my maxes on lifts, it would only cause more harm to me mentally. Ignorance is definitely bliss when you're starting again from scratch, and you have no business pushing yourself to the max at this point. You will thank yourself for choosing to ignore the truth at this time later down the road, I promise.

**Accumulate work capacity**

This should be your number one priority. Your tolerance for work capacity has dropped so far down and you need to ease back into it. Go very slow! Do not jump in the deep end right away, you have no business running a 6 day routine with 5-7 exercises a day, 2 exercises a day and some light conditioning will take you far at this stage. 

**Focus on practicing**

Those motor patterns that are 'gone' are still there, just dormant. You cannot force or rush this phase, it is a process. Focus each training session around a compound movement and do not go anywhere close to failure. You should barely be straining at first, your muscles need to relearn the movement and you need to focus on coordination. Trying to build muscle at this point is asinine and not what we are after. Your body is terribly inefficient at moving weight again but will regrow exponentially faster than the first time if you do it the right way. Keeping it light without a ton of volume is perfect, that way you get more practice than muscle damage. 

**High frequency, low intensity low volume per session**

I originally said low volume, but that's really not true on a weekly basis. I lifted everyday, but only did 2 exercises of 4-6 sets of 6-10 reps. This is all you need at first and I promise it will set you up for success. You will not be stuck training like this for long.

**How to pick weights** 

I recommend you read easy strength by dan john, as this had a lot of influence on my returning to training.

This was very simple for me, just pick a weight that used to be your first or second warmup set. It should be extremely light, like lighter than you are probably thinking right now. You can do more with light weight, you can put more force into the bar than required or change the tempo to make it more difficult. F=ma, there I just proved it scientifically. If you choose a weight that's too heavy, not only can you not do these things, but you also don't have room to progress and you might end up missing. 

**How to progress**

The first month I used a very simple double progression model, which is to say you don't increase load until 2 variables are achieved. For example, say my deadlift day starts at 3x6 (which it did). The next session I'd do 4x6. The session after that I'd do 4x8, then 5x8, followed by 5x10. Only after I reached 5x10 on an exercise would I add weight and reset to 3x6. And I usually only added 10lbs each time I reset back to 3x6. The second month, start adding in hard conditioning, hill sprints and 60/120s are my go to and will always be a staple for me. I recommend you go easy on conditioning at first though.

**When to stop and move on**

You'll know you're ready when you are confident enough to test your maxes. 2.5 months back for me was enough. I tested my maxes and about 85% of my strength was back. 

Returning after a layoff can feel daunting and is a dreadful experience, but you will pick up where you left off in a very fast time frame. You'll get those gains back so fast that you'll feel like you're on steroids. [This](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFA6RWOgKqC/?igshid=pbpl1bae3ogd) is only a few months away from [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLzvb0sAz87/?igshid=1lsfrtu2ciw55). I hope this helps someone, anyone. If you're trying to get back into lifting but are just too discouraged after a couple of sessions, please give this a shot and let me know how it goes for you."
"[Food] Looking for quick and easy diet planning on a busy schedule Im really struggling with planning a diet with simple ingredients. I've tried EatThisMuch, but the dishes it recommends are straight out of masterchef. I dont have access to many of these ingredients (third world problems) thats why I would prefer simple ones. Honestly, I wouldnt mind eating the raw ingredients, I just don't know what to eat. Any suggestions?"
"Confidence in powerlifting I don’t know if this even counts to be here but whatever. I just wanna know from people who have been to a lot of powerlifting meets (supposedly) 

(Male freshman) So I recently went to a powerlifting meet with a bunch of other schools, and I’m in the lowest weight class. I got my ass absolutely kicked by everyone else but that didn’t surprise me. What did was that the exercise that we were maxing in (hang clean / power clean, squat and bench) I couldn’t anywhere near my max on any of those for some reason. I only got 70 on my max bench even though I’ve maxed 80 on it before. I got only 80 on my power clean max even though I’ve gotten 95 before. And I only got 140 though I’ve maxed out at 145. I don’t get it. Was it just because of nerves or what? And if it was, anywhere I can stop that from happening?"
Digestive enzymes suggestion? I’m 17 and trying to gain weight to play college football. I’ve put on about 15 pounds majority muscle the past 10 months and would consider my genetics to be pretty good. Lately I’ve had a hard time breaking a plateau at around 188-190 pounds because I simply can’t eat enough because I constantly feel full. Any digestive enzymes out there that can help me digest food more efficiently and allow me to consume more food to break this plateau? Any other suggestions to stimulate appetite are also greatly appreciated. I currently only take a probiotic supplement as sometimes my digestion gets a bit clogged ( hard time shitting )
"Passed out in the gym today squatting Never happened before. I finished up a set and started losing my vision and feeling very nauseous. I squat without shoes so I went to put them on to go to the bathroom to vomit and the next thing I remember is waking up on the rack with 5-6 people over me including a trainer calling 911. I progressively started feeling better after coming to but had to sit through a cops questioning and a paramedics EKG in front of everyone. Wasn’t fun. Anyone else have a similar experience?

Edit: I did eat before, I have a PB sandwich on wheat bread and an apple before every workout. I’ve been really stressed out because of school and it’s affected my performance if I had to guess. It’s funny because come to think of it, after my first serious girlfriend broke up with me, I remember doing a summer xc hill workout soon after and practically the same thing happening. Stress and the burden it holds can really mess up something seemingly routine in terms of your fitness imo"
"Grow into 15% body fat? Might be a dumb question or one that’s been asked before. I’m just wondering if I’m currently at 20% body fat but my goal is to be at 15%, instead of cutting can I just stay at calorie maintenance and continue lifting weights until I natural grow in to 15% body fat? 
Thanks!"

At the gym:
 
Dumbbells ranging from 5 to 100 lbs (i think)
Lat pull down machine
Bench machine
Tricep pull down machine (or whatever it's called)
Cycle equipment


Home

Pull up bar (thought it fits my door frame terribly)
Resistance bands (up to 25 lbs)


I think the biggest issue will obviously be getting s good leg work out in, but there must be something I can sub in that will work for a few months.

Any suggestions?"
"What would happen if you start an extremely slow cut? I'm nearing my weight goal by being only 4kg away. My body, over a year and a half since starting training, has seen an amazing change. I couldn't be more happier. Not quite the goal body I'm aiming to but it's the next best thing. The thing is, meanwhile, I have put on a lot of size. It was hard and painful work. And I'm loving the look of it. 

However, it wasn't all muscle. Naturally, gaining so much weight I gained a fair bit of fat too. It's really not that much. I kept definition everywhere except in my abdomen area. If I flex really hard the abs will show, but yeah I did grow a bit of gut. Anywhere else is pitch perfect. Defiinition on my chest, traps, shoulders and arms. Now I'm contemplating cutting but like an extremely low deficit. I'm talking near maintenance levels of deficit. The reasons are twfold: I'm afraid to look scrawny again and lose a lot of my muscle. Secondly, my legs, however, did not see the development I hoped I'd get. I'm afraid if I cut they'd just get even thinner then they are right now. 

PS: I'm also afraid of losing the strength I gained, which is pretty cool for my size.

Any opinions/advice are highly welcome! Thank you"
"Should I stay the course despite what my electronic scale is telling me? BACKGROUND &amp; GOALS: I am a classic case of skinny-fat (very little muscle due to previous irresponsible crash dieting with very little weight training experience in the past, 16% body fat, look terrible with fat concentrated on my belly). 

My strategy to fix my physique has been to gain muscle at a slow rate, even if I gain a little bit of fat along the way (with the thinking that if I gain more muscle than fat as I go, my bf% will go down through the process). 

DIET: I am eating 1g of protein per lb of body weight per day and am only eating a 100-200 calorie surplus each day. Fats: 20-30% (was higher, but have brought this down), carbs: 30-40%, protein: 30-40%. I'm really trying my damndest to be exact with my tracking. Eating almost exclusive homemade, quality food.

TRAINING: I am in my second week of PHUL. Really liking the program. Am focusing on the proper rep-ranges with progressive overload being my focus. I am getting stronger.

SLEEP: at least 8-9 hours

QUESTION: Is it too early to be seeing any muscle gain? My electronic scale is telling me that my bf% is going UP and that my skeletal muscle is going DOWN which is the exact opposite of what I am after. Should I be trusting my scale and making changes at this stage or should I ignore this and stay the course? 

Appreciate the insight into what I should be expecting to see after 2-4 weeks of consistent training."
"Just starting going to the gym 2 weeks ago and I love it, but eating is difficult for me. So for the first time ever at 21 I decided to go to the gym after my best friends kept begging me to go because I’d feel better about myself and I really do. I love going and slowly seeing myself get stronger and progressively increasing my weight. My friends push me and I feel proud of myself for finally getting out of my comfort zone. 

What I don’t like though is eating. I’ve always been skinny I’m 5”6 at about 120lbs and I rarely have an appetite making it hard to finish my meals. For breakfast I always have a shake which makes consumption easier and that’s an easy 600 calories. But then the rest of the day I struggle to finish a lot of my meals because I just get stuffed so easily. I try to eat at least 3,000 calories a day but I’m really only making 2,000. I see progress already in the mirror which gives me motivation but I don’t want to be super skinny. Any tips on how I can increase my appetite or just make eating not so nauseating?"
Bulking while still running I’m wondering whether to add the calories that burn on a run onto my daily calorie intake. For example I’m on about 3300 calories a day right now and this morning I ran 17 miles. I know that I should definitely be adding some extra calories but I don’t know how many. My garmin says I burnt nearly 2000 so do I eat 5500? Cheers
"Lost my progress due to a breakup, what should I do to build a base level of strength so that I can start a program like 5/3/1? Recently my first relationship of 3 years ended. I had been going to the gym for 3 months and made some noticeable gains but the emotional wreck of the breakup completely destroyed the progress I had made. My body simply rejected food for nearly two weeks and my gains have worn off me. I haven't stepped foot inside the gym for nearly 4 weeks however part of that is because I moved cities and the city I moved to went straight into lockdown when I got there. 

The week before we broke up I did the first week of the 5/3/1 variation, Benching the Monolith. It felt like a much better workout than anything I've done. It was properly challenging and I can see how it would work. Now that I'm ready to hit the gym again and lockdown is lifting tomorrow I'd like to run this program but I honestly think it will be far too challenging to jump straight into. So I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for a gentle routine to get a base level of strength up to prepare me for running more challenging programs like Benching the Monolith? 

On the positive side, I lost a lot of body fat. My diet wasn't clean enough previously so now I have a good base to build off in a much healthier, leaner bulk. Also my ex was vegan so I'm not so limited by her diet requirements anymore."
"Can't seem to make chest gains working out from home Hey r/gaintit,

I've been following this subreddit since November and in January, I finally started to do something about my lack of gains. January 1st, I was 150 lbs, and I'm 6'3. I take in roughly 2800-3000 calories a day. I do push/pull/legs twice a week and Sunday is rest day. I now weight 165 lbs and have been seeing some solid gains.

Since starting, I've been able to see results everywhere EXCEPT my chest. My chest feels stronger if I press it but in terms of mass size, it doesn't look any different. I currently do - dumbbell bench press, dumbbell incline bench press, inclined chest flyes and push ups (regular and wide). Push ups seem to be the only exercise where I feel my chest after the work outs, the rest feel like it works my traps more than anything.

Wanted to ask - is this normal? Is chest harder to see gains than other muscle groups? Should I try other exercises or could something be off with my form?

General info - I do not have access to a gym and probably won't for a few more months. No dip station and can't make a home one either with the stool chairs I have in my apartment. Have access to a workout bench, pull up bar, two dumbbells that go up to 40 lbs each (which I can bench press for 3x12, albeit I'm winded after) and tensions bands.

Any insight or tips would be greatly appreciated, as this sub has been amazing for general knowledge for a beginner like me!"
"Gain food for in the van I've recently changed jobs, where now I spend most of my time travelling to sites in my van. Although I have a microwave in my van (I'm fancy and filthy in equal measures), it's a lot easier to be able to just grab and eat my food.

What are some healthy foods I can make that I can eat quickly and on the go? I know that wraps can be decent but I'm sure that would very quickly get boring"
"Looking for advice. Should I up my calories a week after doing so if I haven't seen a change in weight? So basically I have been on a lean bulk and have been successfully gaining 0.25kgs per week (0.55lbs). I weigh myself each day then calculate a weekly average. 

This has been working up until recently when things were dropping off slightly so I decided last week to add another 150 calories to my daily diet.

This week however I haven't gained anything. 

My question is, should I stay with it or should I up my calories by about 100 again?

Thanks"
"Does anyone else feel like the more weight gain, the more they plateau? Title. inb4 “just eat more dude”. It’s odd I felt like in the beginning of my weight gain journey I literally put on 12 lbs in a month and now it’s usually 2-3lbs per month. 

Im obviously not complaining since I’d rather not have a massive fat gain with little muscle so quickly. Just wondering what you guys think."
"Gaining weight and muscle is honestly such a good feeling Growing up, I was always considered to be a skinny kid. My friends would constantly tease me and my parents' friends and relatives would mention how skinny I looked.

I always had trouble working hard and really dedicating myself to a cause. This time, however, I decided that I was tired of being skinny and wanted to gain weight.

In October, I began working out at home and gaining weight. It was baby steps at the beginning since I was restricted by the lack of equipment. I still managed to gain a good bit of weight though, which motivated me to join the gym once it opened in my country.

January is when I finally started going to the gym and since then I've seen some pretty significant changes in my body, both in terms of size and strength.

My parents' friends now compliment me for how much more muscular I look. Today I sent a snap of my body post workout to a bunch of people and a few people ended up complimenting me for it, most importantly this girl I've been into for the longest time.

I'm only halfway there and still have a long way to go, but I just wanted to say that I'm really satisfied with the progress I've made so far.

I don't mean to brag at all and just want other people who are starting out to use this as motivation. I remember how hard the first month was, when I had to force myself to eat and would literally belch and almost puke at each bite.

Keep going lads, it'll be worth it in the end."
"any good video suggestions about good form for compound lifts? i'm gonna start working out and know form is the most important thing for beginners and looking for good and comprehensive videos for good form. 

THANKS IN ADVANCE 💪🏽"
Where do shoulders and forearms fit on a P/P/L workout schedule. I assume I could just do 10-20 min of forearms on a pull day but what day does shoulders fit into? Is it even worth doing forearms?
"Fear of bulking So this may sound completely stupid but hear me out as I need some hand holding.

I’ve been on a gradual weight loss for several years having started out weighing 97.5kg and have gradually worked it down to now floating around 70kg - obviously I’m happy with this and I’m somewhere between skinny fat and ‘toned’.

My goals never to be ‘huge’ but I do want to get some more size to my arms and fill my shirt out, I can’t lift that heavy but I do want to start taking increasing strength more seriously when the gyms reopen (UK lockdown atm) and I know feasibly to do this I’ll need to increase my calories.

Currently to lose the weight I’ve been eating about 1600 calories a day and burning about 500 a day doing cardio and weight training. My TDEE according to the net is about 1750.

Basically I am pretty sure I’ll need to start eating like 2000-2100 but I’m worried that I’m going to put all my weight back on - I know I’m going to get heavier and I will likely put on some fat when trying to gain muscle hence the whole bulk cut cycle thing, but is it just a case of making sure I’m lifting heavy to ensure it’s muscle I’m gaining and not fat or is there more to it I’m missing?"
"M (140LB &gt; 180LB) 25 Years Old - 4 Year Progress Report 
**Background:** I’ve always been small. 5’9 &amp; 140lbs. I boxed for 4 years but didn’t weight train, I decided to start lifting weights after I got diagnosed with a detached retina. 

It was a lot to learn, and I started off barely benching the bar. Even though it was embarrassing to be at the gym, I still went. 

I bulked to 160lbs during my first year, and continued cutting/bulking cycles. (This is very ineffective, and looking at my physique today, I realize that.) 

In 2019, I got deployed and dropped to my lowest weight ever at 138lbs when it was all said and done. Upon returning home I immediately got back in the gym, and muscle memory hit me like a train. Within a month I was back to 160lbs &amp; I’m currently fluctuating between 175-180lbs

MUSCLE MEMORY IS A DRUG! (I wasn’t even necessarily bulking when I came home, I was eating out constantly and just enjoying myself, but my training was very serious.) 

Overall Transformation (More at the bottom.) : [Imgur link ](https://imgur.com/gallery/5lBqwbA)

 
**Stats:** 5'9"", Male, SW 140LB, CW 180LB

**Lift Progress:** I’m aware I’m not very strong, my numbers should be higher for someone who’s trained for 4 years. But I like to focus on bodybuilding vs powerlifting. There is no shame in that! I stopped worrying about numbers a couple years ago, and I am much happier now that I don’t have that weight on my shoulders. 

**Bench:** 65LB &gt; 245LB (no lie, I barely could do the bar. My first max was legitimately 65lbs) 

**Squat:** 95LB &gt; 315LB

**Deadlift:** 135LB &gt; 375LB

**OHP:** 45LB &gt; 135LB (Most impressive in my opinion, OHP utilizes much more than just shoulder strength! Good technique can get you stronk) 

**Diet:** I tracked calories using the infamous MyFitnessPal app. I started at 2700 cals, &amp; slowly transitioned into 3200 cals. Eating this many calories has always been difficult for me, I thought I was a “hardgainer” but then I realized I was using that as an excuse as to why I’m not hitting my goals. My most successful way of thinking was forcing myself to eat 1000 cals in the morning, &amp; 800 for lunch. Dinner was easy to get calories in, because I could consume 500 cals before the gym, and whatever remained I could fit in after the gym. 

IF YOU’RE BULKING: Breakfast is a HUGE indicator on how your day will go. If you can wake up 30 mins earlier than normal, you’ll have more time to cook quality food and put a dent into the days calories. My favorite breakfast was always: 6 scrambled eggs, 2 Kodiak Pancakes, a bowl of strawberries, &amp; 2 packets of oatmeal. 

Lunch: Usually 8-12oz of chicken breast and 1 cup of rice. With a side of steamed broccoli (thank you instant pot) 

Dinner (Pre Gym): 1 pack of ramen (the sodium gives you joocy pumps.) And a banana (cus helth.) 

Post Gym: 2 scoops of protein shake (50g of protein.)

Dinner (Post Gym): Pasta noodles &amp; ground beef or steak. (Depends what I have time to cook) 

**If I didn’t hit my required calories, I would make my homemade mass gainer shake. 

MY MASS GAINER RECIPE:
-2 scoops of protein
-1 cup oats
-1 spoon of Peanut Butter 
-1/2 banana (eat the other half, it’s just a yummy snack) 
This amounted to approximately 700-800 cals, depending on your protein. 


**Routine:**

I’ve pretty much followed PPL for my whole lifting career. I tried nSuns for a bit, but I didn’t like doing 8sets of power lifts. I was more focused on doing bodybuilding movements. I’ve never done anything out of the ordinary with my training, it’s always been pretty basic and just use what I had at my gym.  


PUSH DAY: 
5x5 Bench Press (FLAT) 

4x12 Bench Press (INCLINE) 

4x15 Pec Deck (Fly’s)

4x10 Chest Press

4x10 Lying Dumbbell Skullcrushers (I noticed I get more activation out of my triceps by using dumbbells versus a EZ bar or barbell.)

4x12 Rope Push Down

4x10 Reverse Pull Down (Use a bar for these and grip the bar underhand, this is my favorite triceps exercise. I’ve never felt activation quite like this.)


PULL DAY
5x5 Deadlifts 

4x10 Barbell Row

3x10 Good Morning (usually after the 3rd set my lower back is like “nah fam” so I rarely went over 3 sets) 

4x10 Lat Pulldown 

4x10 Cable Row 

4x12 Bicep Curls

4x7 Hammer Curls (HEAVY)

4x10 Incline Dumbbell Curls 

4x21 21’s (great to finish off with.)

4x10 Rear Delt Fly


LEG DAY (.. and shoulders)
5x5 Barbell Squat

4x8 Front Squat 

4x10 Leg Press

4x15 Leg Extension (go light, work the eccentric motion. Try to take pressure off your knees, this exercise is notorious for wrecking knees.)

4x12 Hamstring Curl (go light, focus on the SQUEEZE, if you do these right you may have Charlie horses that night in bed. ) 🥴

5x5 Overhead Press 

4x15 Side Lateral Raise 

4x15 Front Raise (Dumbbell) 


***TIPS***

Buying a crock pot / instant pot is a game changer. I could throw a roast or even a steak in the crock pot, let it cook on low while I slept. And when I woke up, I had a fresh meal ready to go! 

DON’T WEIGH YOURSELF EVERYDAY (this can be counterproductive when you get tunnel vision on a number. I weigh myself on Mondays / Thursdays.. And always weigh yourself at the same time everyday. First thing in the morning is best, before you eat.) 

Getting in calories immediately after the gym is an easy way to hit your calorie numbers. Your body is taxed and can absorb more food right after (jk Idk if that’s even true but that’s what I tell myself🤔) nah but for real, it’s always easier for me to get in calories right after the gym, so I usually double scoop a protein shake. 

Creatine is your friend, take creatine. No you don’t have to hand in your natty card, and it won’t cause you to behave any differently. But it does retain water and help you become more “full looking” 

GET BLOODWORK DONE! Usually bloodwork is only recommended if your cycling steroids, but you NEED TO KNOW if your body is producing enough Test, and if certain supplements are needed for your diet!! 


Alright.. what everyone comes for.. here are the..

"Woke up 8 pounds (3,5kg) lighter today, what's up with that? So I've been weighing myself everyday for the last month or so (after I wake up and do...my business ) and was stuck in 73,5kg, which is not bad because I've manage to build muscle and was loosing some fat slowly, so the scale staying still is not a bad thing. But today I weighed myself in the same way as all the previous days and was weighing 70kg, that's crazy! Could it be water weight? Because that's a lot for my size."
"I’ve gained 23 lbs in 5 months. I feel like I should stop bulking but I’m making insane progress. I’ve been bulking at home only using a 53 lb kettlebell, pull up bar, bench and adjustable dumbbells that go up to 54 from 15 lbs. I’ve gained 24 lbs. I’m probably pushing 20% bf, maybe a bit more. I’m 24, 5’9, 182ish now, which is a high BMI but I naturally am heavy. I graduated high school at like 177 with abs. But I’m seeing progress I feel like every 2 weeks. I’m between jobs and living with my parents right now so I don’t have control over the kitchen, which I feel like makes it easier to bulk. [here’s ](https://imgur.com/a/o0ykVBi) what I look like for reference (that’s good lighting to be fair). Should I just embrace the chonk and take the gains while I’m getting them or start cutting?"
"Advice for sore knees on leg day? Recently my knees have been getting painfully sore during lifts. Its not sharp knee pain, but the area around my knee feels like its swelling/sore. I started noticing it on my squat days, and now I'm also noticing it on deadlift days. I feel fine on days I don't lift legs, and my legs feel fine until I get to my 3rd sets (I'm doing 5/3/1). The last time I had knee issues was from bad form when I first got into lifting like 7 or 8 years ago, that was quickly fixed and I've been fine since.

I've been icing my knees, but I'm wondering if the lack of cardio in my workouts may be contributing to my knees possibly getting weaker? (if that's even a thing) I'm currently squatting and deadlifting more than I ever have in my life, so my knees are probably not used to this. 

Anyone have a good workout to build strength in the knee area for heavier lifting, or advice? Is this just a ""ice them and rest them"" kind of situation or should I be doing stuff to support my knees? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also: I currently don't wear knee sleeves (but have been thinking of buying some), or any other physical gear for squats. Just flat converse shoes - and a belt when I deadlift.

Edit: thank you everyone for the solid advice! It seems pretty obvious I need to learn to squat with a knee sleeve and possibly look into a supplement for the pain/swelling (whatever it is). Thank you all again!

Edit to my edit: Even more so.. taking some time off to focus on lower weight and form perfection is always beneficial. If I see no improvement I'll go see a physical therapist."
Is it fine to be starting at an easy weight and increasing weight each set? In the past I didn’t lift much but when I did I always did my sets at the same weight. For the last month and a half I’ve been lifting with my buddy and we’ve been following his friends routine which has us start at an easy weight and slowly increase the weight each set until on the 4th and last set you’re actually lifting heavy weight. I’ve never lifted like this and I really haven’t noticed any progress in the last month and a half. I’m wondering if anyone else has had success lifting weights by increasing like that.

Before pic is after a few months of working out at a slight caloric bulk. I worked out all throughout college on blaha’s ICF, Alpha destiny’s program, and even programs I created myself but I was very inconsistent with my diet. 

Post grad, I hopped on a Bulgarian style of training program and have been pounding a gallon of milk a day (2400 cals) + two extra 850 cal meals. My numbers on the big three have been shooting up and I’ve gained 10 lbs in 2 months. 

Goal weight is around 165lbs for end of this year"
"How to bulk with busy schedule? (High School) I know many of you can relate to being restricted on time, hence its more difficult to get food in. During the summer, I was dedicated and my lifts, sleep, motivation and my diet was in check. But going to fully in person class 5 days a week, it has become increasingly difficult to get enough calories and even harder to get enough protein in. 

I know a majority of getting your meals in is a discipline issue. Which I’m lacking. Do you guys have any example of what you would do for your meals. Especially a situation where you can’t bring your food into school/ work. I don’t care if it’s clean or not, as long as it doesn’t make me feel like shit."
"First time bulker worried that he's just getting fat again, and not actually getting fit at all. M / 28yrs / 168lbs. / 5' 10"" / 19% bf

Background: About two years ago, I was a very pudgy, unathletic 185lbs. when I decided to start making an effort to better my health. I learned about CICO, began tracking my calories and making sure I wasn't eating more than 1500 calories/day, as well as started training for half-marathons. This became a pretty on-and-off routine for me during the past two years. Eventually, I was able to get down to 158lbs, and felt pretty great, but I was still physically weak, with not much muscle on me whatsoever.

Five weeks ago, I decided to join a gym and shift my focus towards weight lifting and bulking for the first time in my life. My issue is, I feel like I'm gaining too much fat too quickly, and I honestly feel like shit.

When I started my bulk, I began by eating 3,000 kcal/day, which was a 500 kcal surplus from my TDEE, and I made sure I was getting 160g protein/day. As I started to notice I was putting on more than 1 lb./week,  I started reducing my daily calorie intake, and right now I'm consuming 2,500 kcal/day. But, over the past five weeks I have gained 10 lbs, and my belly is getting noticeably larger at a much faster rate than my muscles. Right now, I feel fat, constantly bloated from forcing myself to eat enough food, and because I'm always bloated I consistently feel lethargic and very low energy. I honestly felt physically better when I only ran and focused on eating fewer calories, which I know is counterintuitive. But, I want to get bigger, stronger, and start putting on muscles, and I know I can only do that by eating more calories.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently doing nSuns 4days/week, as well as running \~15 miles/week.

My typical diet right now is 340g cottage cheese + 1 scoop protein powder for breakfast / chicken breast + leftover veggies + cup of rice for lunch / dinner is usually pretty variable, but I try to keep it within my calorie and protein goals for the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm really just looking for reassurance on whether this is a normal experience, and if I need to suck it up and start raising my daily caloric intake and just accept that fat comes with muscle. I know that five weeks is not a very long time at all to start seeing any progress whatsoever, but if I'm making mistakes, I'd like to start course-correcting as soon as possible.

Not being able to get enough food down is an actual problem that a lot of powerlifters and bodybuilders often face when they’re trying to push the number on the scale. Force feeding is hard work, and can make for being extremely uncomfortable when you have to eat beyond the point of satiation. I’ve been there. The scale stops moving, calories are already extremely high, and you’re really full after every meal and even before your next meal. It can be really frustrating feeling bloated. After all, they say your gut is like a second brain. So if digestion isn’t on point, it’s not unheard of to be unhappy because of it.

I do not have a problem with appetite anymore. There is a number of strategies I have implemented to help getting the food down. I hope the tips that I have accrued throughout this offseason help you out and allow you to get more food down the hatch.

1. PROTEIN IS VERY SATIATING. I started my last prep at 280g of protein per day. That’s a lot of protein for an 82kg person. No wonder I was struggling to finish my meals (I always did though. Despite having to force it down.) The protein was too excessive for my bodyweight. However, I didn’t get my protein that high on purpose. It happened by default when I was upping my carbs. The small amounts of protein you get from carbs such as rice, potatoes and pastas all add up. When I was increasing the calories, I mistakenly kept my serving size of meat for each meal the same. This ended up me continually adding protein to my diet beyond the point of it being excessive. Even a lot of fat sources contain quite a high amount of protein. Fats like nuts and cheese add protein as well. So the approach I took this year was this. Keep protein at 1g/2.5-3x BW in kg. When upping carbs, drop volume of meat per meal to suit with the added protein I’m getting from that meals carb source. Keep in mind, carbohydrates are protein sparring, so especially in a calorie abundant environment, having a little less protein from animal sources won’t be detrimental to progress. It will be helpful, because you’ll be able to get more carbs down. Unlike protein, carbohydrates are appetite stimulating. Leaving you hungrier and ready for your next meal. Every 60 days, I readjust my Fat and Protein numbers to suit my new bodyweight. This usually only makes for a small increase of 5-8g for each. Like I mentioned in a previous blog, my fats stay right around 1g/1kg BW. So keeping fats low and protein moderate, allows me to eat the least satiating macro more, allowing for continuous calorie progression, and no feeling of bloat or distension.
2. 10 MINUTE WALKS. A common problem that people struggling to consume enough calories due to being too full is not efficiently digesting what they’re eating. The first step is to eat foods that you can digest easily. And then consider going for a brisk 10 minute walk following that meal. Improve digestion, improve appetite, also, improve metabolism.
3. Stan Efferding’s patent pending MONSTER MASH. A way I have found making very large meals less intimidating is by making it into a mash by adding roughly 30 mL of chicken broth to it. It makes the large meal SO much easier to eat. It’s almost like the meal is already chewed up for you, you just need to send it down the hatch. Chicken broth has a lot of health and immunity benefits, but it also makes for meals that sit real easy in the stomach, and somehow, probably magic, don’t fill you up. This make consuming 1,000 calories in a sitting feel like Childs play.
4. IF YOU CANT EAT ALL YOUR CARBS, THEN DRINK ‘EM! I use orange juice. 3 times a day, 500mL each. 50g of carbs, 215 calories, fucking delicious. This makes for 150g of carbs, 645 kcal a day just from liquid. It is as satiating as 500 mL of water. Go figure. Plus, loaded with micronutrients.
5. SMALLER, MORE FREQUENT MEALS. No science or research papers to back this one up. The way I see it is simple. I want to look like a bodybuilder, so, i’ll eat like one. Provide the body with a message, hopefully the body gets the message. Give the body enough cellular signalling to achieve the goals that you are intentionally providing it. If you want to fast all day and look like your hobbies include yoga and Prius conferences, then go for it. I find it difficult getting 5,000 calories in, in a 4 hour window. So my solution is simple. Do it the way the bodybuilders have done it from the start. Eat from the moment I get up, to before I go to bed.

This list is simple. Really simple. But it’s these little details that often get overlooked when assessing ones diet. Constant overfeeding, in my opinion, leads to blown-out midsections and enlarged waists. I feel like I fell prey to this after only a year of force feeding. I started the mass phase very lean, got to power-shovelling the food, ate beyond satiation, dieted back down, and my waist was noticeably larger then before. If you’re digesting your food properly, hunger levels follow as a result. If you’re NOT hungry for your next meal, instead of forcing the next one day, firstly, address why it is that you’re not hungry. If you were breaking down food efficiently, you’d be ready to eat every single time that next meal was knocking on your bodybuilding goals door. 

As a side note, Pro Tan emphasises that SHIT out of stretch marks. Blow out your waist? Better get comfortable with the stretch marks on the glutes, hips, lower back and lower abs to stick out like dogs balls.

There’s no such thing as a hard gainer. Every single person that i’ve conversed with who self-diagnosis’ themselves as struggling to put on weight, is simply put, not even close to trying hard enough. Force feeding is really uncomfortable, but it’s not the only means of getting those needed calories down. Learn to choose foods that you can eat in large quantities, pick foods that are extremely dense in calories, and address digestion issues. If the scale isn’t moving upwards, it’s not because you’re a hard gainer, it’s because it doesn’t mean enough to you. To actually illicit some change in bodyweight, you may have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It took me a while of struggling to continue the linear progression of weight gain to start implementing the five tips I outlined above, but when I did, eating became a lot more enjoyable, and easier. Like they say, “Compliance is the science.” So get to eating, but eating smart, and in a manner that stimulates hunger, and not alleviate it."
"Gaining while on medication question I've been prescribed Adderall for 5 years now due to ADHD, and I'm worried it will make it harder for me to make any noticeable gains. I understand that this is a complex question, but for those of you on stimulant medications who have made progress, how did you work around the reduced appetite associated with them to gain? Was it simply a matter of consuming more calories to compensate?"

"I need to manage a £57 budget for one month This is a temporary situation, I already have some basics at home like whey, spices, oil, herbs etc

How can I healthily hit my calories without blowing this budget? Most of my regular buys (eggs, meat, lactose free milk, berries, nuts, avocados) become expensive per week relative to this budget


EDIT: thank you all so much for the answers! I decided to settle on rice, beans, whey protein, oats, potatoes , bread and cheap veg for this month. Luckily, I happen to have a jar of coconut oil and olive oil for extra calories. I don't have a huge caloric need (2000 kcal and 120 protein since I'm female) so I think I can manage for this month with what I have.
Also thank you so much for the kind souls who offered grocery money, I believe I have enough money to meet the bare minimum this month, and like some of you advised, I can go to a food pantry if I truly don't have enough."

"Is this squat rack too low? I'm looking for a pull up bar and squat station combo and I've found this super cheap one on Amazon. However after close examination the squat rack only goes up to a max height of 3'7"". This seems very low when I'm 6'2"". Is it okay to start squats from this height? Whenever I've seen anyone do squats it's been more or less from a standing position.

I only ask as the pull up bar on this can be lowered a fair amount and I'm low on space unless I put it outside.

"Does anyone else experience nausea if you go to hard on leg day? And if so what do you do to prevent it? I have been back in the swing of things for a little while now and though I admit I don’t hit legs quite as often as I should, I still hit them at least once every two weeks. However if I go to hard I get super nauseous and have actually thrown up multiple times in the past from too intense leg days. Anyone have a solution?"
"Is there any real science supporting rest days? All the stuff swirling around regarding rest days seems totally anecdotal. Lots of vague mentions of benefits that often seem to relate to the mental side of people. Maybe I'm a freak but I absolutely love picking up weight throughout the day. When I feel like I can do another set I go for it. I love the feeling of having a pump at all times.

So what's up with all these rest days? I searched for studies and the few I found seemed to be comparing one group with rest days to another without rest days... with the same total volume!

If you don't take rest days you can creep your volume up on what you would have done wasting all that time. The studies don't take that into account probably because then they are comparing apples to oranges. But it seems to me the non-rest days people are going to just get more volume in over the long haul. They will be grabbing bigger weights at the end of the month. A car not stopping every other day is going to go much father, it seems to me. All the stuff on the web refers to factors like the fact that people will apparently flake out if they have to do something every day. Well, whatever. That doesn't answer the question of whether working out continually would actual lead to greater gains. For those of you who are going to say I am obviously not working out intensely enough... I'm not so sure their 2 or 3 sessions on the same muscle group is really getting them as far as 6 or 7 would. So, can any one point me to any facts about this?

PS - I totally get it's simply not feasible for a lot of people to get to the gym more than 3 times a week... totally understand... and this is no slight to them. I just want some real answers for those of us who have the option of daily sessions.

PPS - I also don't know of any science supporting that my approach leads to greater gains. I just suspect it does. And I of course have to wonder if my gains would be, in fact, greater with rest days, bummer as they are. Someone... show me some science!"
"Is one shake sufficient, or do we need 2? Hi,

I'm a 5'3.5, 102 lbs, 28 year old female looking to gain about 5 pounds in 5 weeks.  I have incorporated a shake into my diet.  The current recipe is 1 banana, 1 cup of milk, 1 scoop of protein, 2 tbs of peanut butter, and 1 cup of oats.  It's about 800 calories.  

Is one shake sufficient for the day or do I need 2? I don't really like shakes generally, but I know I have to drink them to gain weight.

I eat normal meals.  Usually 3 a day with mindless snacking in between lol

My exercise is usually 15-30 mins of yoga daily, weight or resistance band training 2-3 times a week."
"Can't sleep in calorie surplus ??? I find it very hard to go to sleep, and once i do it seems to be very light and i get woken up easily, and then very hard to get back to sleep.

"Tricep plateau The past few months I’ve hit a tricep plateau. For some context, I’m in my 20s, I’ve been lifting since high school, I’m 210lbs, 19% bf, diet is dialed in, and am on gear. Despite working the hell out of my triceps I haven’t seen any growth in the past several months unlike the rest of body. 

My current tricep exercises usually consists of this: ez bar skullcrushers, dumbell skullcrushers, rope pull downs, push downs, reverse grip pull downs, cable kickbacks, seated overhead cable extensions, and many variations of said exercises.

"Finished my first ever bulk - 8 Months - 190lb to 230lb Hey all,

Just wanted to drop in and say I just finished my first ever bulk. 

Started this bulk cycle at 190lb on July 1st after having lost 150lb from my peak weight of 340lb back in June of 2019.

Losing that much weight left a lot of loose skin, but I'm working on slowly filling it out with muscle.  https://imgur.com/gallery/WtJMxxE

During this time, I ate at a 500kcal surplus to put on a pound per week. Originally, I had planned on stopping my bulk Jan 1st, but was convinced by u/mythicalstrength to keep going, as there is ""never a wrong time to bulk"". So, I kept it going for an extra two months.

From Mid Jan to Mid Feb, I focused primarily on strength and powerlifting, as my gym has a 1000lb club (combined total lifts between deadlift, squat, and bench all are 1000+lb).

I figured as a home-stretch goal, I wanted to hit those numbers. At the time, however, I was about 25lb short, so I found a peaking program solely based around 4 weeks of growing your 1RM. I increase my calories, started this program, and lifted away.

I am happy to say that at the end of those 4 weeks, I managed to get my goal of hitting 1000lb. https://imgur.com/gallery/SmfFfrN

Ultimately, I'm super happy with my progress. 40lb is a lot of weight to gain, a bunch of fat, but a bunch of is also muscle, so for my first bulk, I'm super happy. Looking forward to cutting for a while to strip away excess body fat. 

Thanks for all your continued support and encouragement!  💕💕💕

EDIT: 

The mod would like food and meal info. So, here goes:

For calories, I ate a total of 3,250/day. Sometimes slightly more. Overall, just making sure I was getting enough calories. I stopped really caring about the scale, as I started weighing myself month instead of weekly, as I really just cared about eating to fuel recovery and growth.

Generally, I get about 220gr of protein a day. That's mainly greek yogurt, lunch meat, some type of lean meat like pork loin, protein scoop in my oatmeal in the morning, protein shake after lifting, and that's mainly it for consistent protein sources. 

The rest of the calories could be whatever. But usually I ate the same thing every day:

Breakfast - 1 cup oatmeal in water with a scoop of protein powder. If I was working out that day, I'd eat about an extra 100kcal of fruit.

Lunch - Two wraps on low carb bread, with 200~ calories of meat, some cheese, some mayo, veggies. If I was working out that day, I'd slam about 6 large marshmallows about 30 minutes before lifting.

Dinner - Either huge bowl of stir fried veggies on rice or with meat. Hebrew National Hot dogs... giant chunk of pork loin... whatever.

Snackies - This is where I ate most of my calories, and almost always at night. Usually ends up being about 1200-1500 calories of snacks into the late evening starting around 8p. This might be a big ass bowl of popcorn, some greek yogurt, left overs, bagels, cheese, fudgsicles, whatever. My nights are usually watching something with the wife or playing nerd games, so I'm usually snacking.

EDIT:

People mentioned don't skip leg day. So, I thought I'd drop a bonus leg-day pic. https://imgur.com/a/WYKpLJG"
"2 Day Push/Pull + 1 Full I’m training for a 5k right now so my emphasis is currently on getting my endurance base down. So I’m running around 5-6 miles pretty often. So I’m only trying to lift 3 days a week. 

My plan is to do a push day, pull day and then a full body day with an emphasis on legs. That way I can get one leg day in (I’m trying to minimize the amount of rest from running that comes with too many heavy leg lifts too often), and still work my other muscles twice a week. Perhaps adding some minor isolation leg exercise on my push/pull days and the major compounds for legs on my full day.

Does this sound like an efficient way to split while still gaining muscle and strength?"
"Exercise order and hypertrophy, does it matter? Do you want to be able to hit all of your reps, even though you can hit more by re-ordering exercises with other muscle groups? Like for example, following PHAT:

* Dumbbell Press
* Incline Dumbbell Press
* Incline Chest Press
* Incline Cable Flys
* Preacher Curls
* DB Concentration Curls
* Spider Curls

Is a typical Hypertrophy day (I left out triceps for sake of this post). 

Would it be beneficial to alternate some chest and bicep exercises? I've read here that its mostly about total volume, but I've also read that it's nice to get close to failure, and these seem slightly contradictory (I could spread out chest around bi's to possibly hit a bit more chest reps, with more time to rest).

Just curious what the views are on this"
"Fats Vs. Carbs while bulking What are the side effects of eating high fats vs high carbs while on a bulk? I know the recommended C/F/P ratio is ≈ 50/20/30, but what would be the difference if I were to eat, say 35/35/30? My family does not have any foods that are high in carbs and they pretty much refuse to buy them and it’s insanely difficult to reach my calorie goal without eating at least 30% fats."
"Going to start PHAT again, but some of the exercises require equipment I don't have at home. I mostly just have free weights. What should I replace some of these equipment specific exercises with? Otherwise, is there a more home-gym friendly routine I should look at instead? [PHAT](https://simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html) worked well for me in the past. **Is there a similar power/hypertrophy high volume routine that is more home-gym friendly?**

Unfortunately, some of the assistive/auxiliary exercises in PHAT I can't do here, either because I don't have the equipment or they would make too much noise in my apartment if they involve dropping weights or slamming the weights on the catches. 

Here's the exercises I'm looking for alternatives for. 

- Hack Squats. 
 - I know there's a free weight version, but it's essentially like a deadlift where the plates would hit the floor.
 - Trying to learn how to front-squat in the meantime. 
- Leg Extensions
 - Sissy squats? But I heard those are really bad for your knees
- Leg curls
 - ?
- Leg Press
 - ?

- Lying leg curls
 -  - I can try and do banded lying leg curls, but looking for something better

I don't have much experience with lunges, so I don't know which ones to do or or their set schemes.

- Seated Cable Row
 - I tried using bands, but they're not strong enough

- Close Grip Pull Downs
  - Kinda can do it with the bands if I go extra light and do more isometric squeezes. Dumbbell pullovers put too much strain on my shoulders :(

- Lat pull down
 - Bands definitely don't work for this either. I end up just doing assistive pull-ups and try to do isometric holds to get a similar effect.


A lot of free-weight versions of these assistive/auxiliary exercises are already in the program. Like bent-over/pendly rows, stiff leg/RDL for hamstrings, etc... Should I just do more sets of those exercises?"

I'm doing stronglifts, and I really want to be able to bench my body weight. But my body weight will keep increasing as I keep bulking so I want to know what kind of numbers I should get to before I switch programs. 

anyways, my plan is to keep bulking with strong lifts 5x5 until I reach good numbers (not sure yet what those would be) and then to switch to the 5/3/1 bodybuilding routine. The plan is to bulk until its time to switch, and then to switch to a cut once I switch to the more intermediate bodybuilding routine. Would this be a good idea? Are there any problems with this? Also any other advice?"

"Too Much Volume in Reddit PPL?

I started the “Reddit PPL” not too long ago and noticed it has has 26-34 (!) sets per week for triceps (depending what you count as triceps) and &gt;28 sets per week for biceps. According to Nippard and the research he cites, isn’t that way too much volume for a relatively new lifter like me?

For this reason I end up having to make up most my calories at night once my appetite is built back up, and this is a real struggle. Eating 1000-1500 calories in the last 3 hours of the day.

"Reverse diet help - is this normal?

In that timespan I never ate over 1500 on ANY day, so my body is probably wrecked). I went from 99-100 pounds to 104 this month, and that seems like a lot of weight very fast. For reference, I’m 4’11.6” and 20 years old. I weight train 4 days a week, and go for leisurely walks on most of my rest days.

"Gaining Too Fast On 2800 Long story short I went from obese (104kg) to a healthy weight range (67kg) managing to lose over 80 pounds. This was largely diet and a bit of exercise but really been enjoying weight training and decided to take it seriously this year.

I seemed to maintain nicely at 2500 cals a day getting at least 200g protein doing a PPL routine six days a week so figured 2800 a day was an ideal surplus. But since bumping up to 2800 these are the scale numbers:

1st Feb - 67kg

8th Feb - 68kg

17th Feb - 68kg

24th Feb - 68.7kg

1st March - 69.7kg

Been tracking cals for well over a year now so have a pretty good handle on that, and the only other thing I can think of that's changed is using a new brand of creatine daily, but it's essentially the same stuff I've been taking for a year.

When I started working out, I was somewhere around 70kg (no doubt the biggest part of my weight gain is because of my diet not being perfect, though I'm not a junkfood junky at all).

In the time I have been working out, I have seen changes, but in my opinion, they aren't going fast enough. I'm doing what I think is right, but sometimes I do think to myself: ""Is this the right way? Should I be doing something else? Or maybe do something different with my weights/diet?"". Therefore, I am now asking it here, to give myself the general idea of things I'm doing wrong and things I'm doing good. Also, I have been working out at home all the time, so the only equipment I have are dumbbells and a bench which basically can't incline/decline.

To give an idea of my workout, I exercise every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. All other days I basically don't workout, at best I take a walk for about 30 minutes. Here is my schedule:

**Tuesday: Triceps/Chest/Legs - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 12kg each.**

* Bench press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Dips - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squeeze press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squats - 3 sets of 10
* Tricep Kickback - 3 sets of 8 on each arm
* Bicep Curl - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* One Arm Tricep Extension - 3 sets of 8 on each arm
* Calf Raise - 3 sets of 15

**Thursday: Legs/Biceps/Triceps - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 12kg each.**

* Push-ups - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Bench press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squeeze press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Lunges - 2 sets of 12 on each leg
* Bicep Curls - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Hammer Curls - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squats - 3 sets of 10
* One Arm Tricep Extension - 3 sets of 8 on each arm

**Saturday: Shoulders/Back - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 10kg each (my shoulders and back are a bit weaker than the rest).**

* Overhead Press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Bent-Over - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Wide-grip Upright Row - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Arnold Press - 2 sets of 10, then 1 set of 8
* Bench Bent-Over - 2 sets of 12 on each arm
* Front Raise - 2 sets of 10, then 1 set of 8 and 1 set of 6 (This one is a bit hard for me to complete all 4 sets properly)
* Shrugs - 3 sets of 15

I basically do all exercises with 30 seconds rest between sets and 90 seconds rest between exercises. Now, finally, the thing I am wondering: Is this the good way to go? For sure my diet can be changed, in fact it probably needs to be changed, but is that the sole reason that I find my ""gains"" to be too slow? Or am I taking these exercises on in a very wrong way, making it harder for myself?

I hope you guys can help me out on this one, as I'm willing to work for it, regardless of fast or slow results!"
"7 years lifting, disappointed, help please (Current stats and bodywhat link at end)

Title says it all- I’ve been lifting for a long time but I’ve spent a most of that time doing three things- 
1. Crash dieting to the 130-140 lb range, once to 127 lbs, sometimes maintaining this for 4 months 
2. Subsequently getting injured (stress fractures, sprained ankles and wrists, pulled muscles) and losing drive for periods of 3-4 months  
3. Allowing myself to bulk, but soon ending up as fat as before and with barely any additional 
muscle, like 20%.


YEAR 1
Year 1, went from pretty lean , leaner than my oldest bodywhat pic, at about age 18 and 130 lbs, up to 145 lbs with higher bodyfat. I did my first cut 10-11 months into my first year, from 152 to 135. Overall my lifts went up year 1 from 90/160/115/160 ohp/sq/bench/dl up to about 120/270/190/365. Deadlift was with poor form and mixed grip.

YEAR 2-
 I hit ohp/sq/b/dl 130/290/200/420. Years 3-6 I fucked up repeatedly like above.. 2020 was the year I started to gain some common sense, being age 24. 


CURRENT STATS- 

Now, at 25, I’m stuck. My lifts are at a respectable level - s/bench/dl/ohp- estimated around 340/210/440/145. Haven’t tested bench this year though.
However , my body stats are 5’7.75” 165 lbs 21%-22% bodyfat (estimated with laser X-ray vision). 

More importantly, my damn arms and calves are tiny. I have about 13.5-14” flexed arms, 10.5” forearms, 13.25” calves, on a 7.3” ankle and 6” wrist frame. 

I train hard and end up feeling like an emptied toothpaste tube at the end of my workouts, and have an extremely good diet and sleep. I have normal to high testosterone, with all my tests ever ranging from 640-900, usually at 750 ng/dl.
I don’t know why I’m having so much trouble building muscle! It’s like I can only gain muscle on my ass, thighs, and shoulders, but even then, mostly fat.

3x a week hypertrophy program? Basically I’m looking for a full body 3D a week routine that focuses more on hypertrophy. I’ve done the 3x a week full body 5 x 5 but I find myself getting stuck progress wise on those programs and also I want to focus on aesthetics more than strength
"Varying caloric intake by day? Hey all,

I've been gaining on and off for roughly two years. Making progress and losing it due to work/stress. Now that work has finally died down I want to go full forward and gain 30-40lbs. Now my question is, is varying my calorie intake depending on what I did that day okay? 

I get it might not be the most effective but I have trouble getting my 4000kcal intake on weekends where my days have little to no structure, unlike during the work week where I get up and get home at the same time. Hours will pass by on the weekend I will have forgotten to eat.

Now my 4000kcal intake is due to the nature of my work - im walking 20km a day usually, and my intake has to reflect that. On the weekends I'd much rather stomach 2800kcal and still be in a surplus, since I do very little walking, and hopefully still be gaining.

Is there any deficit to this? Or can something like this work?"

Increase in belly size after 2 months of bulking 2 months back I used to weigh 52.5kgs. Today I am at 57.4kgs. There is a visible difference in my muscle size but I have also gained some belly fat. Is this normal while trying to gain weight? Or am I going too fast? What can I do to continue putting on weight without gaining belly fat?
"Can we relatively trust bodyfat % measurements? I know most measuring tools for body fat are highly inaccurate.

But can we use them to tell wether we gain or loose bf?

For example, I have a scale which purportedly measures bf.
If it says I am at 12% and then two months later it says 15%, can I trust that I gained 25% body fat (somewhat)?"
"I have no idea what I’m doing Around 4 months ago I “started” weight lifting. I was around 150 pounds, 6’1. I had a barbell, dumbells, bench, and an ab roller. I followed this routine I found on this sub, but changed the reps, sets, and weight

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-X4rhy_Eh8FV6XeMWTJcAwK-1Rxy7AZm2SzQm6doiJs/edit

In December, After talking with a couple people and self-reflecting I realized it wasn’t working, and started using Arnold’s basic beginner program #1 using higher weight around 40-60 depending on the exercise, and 15 pounds for dumbbells

Current day, I have to be honest with saying I’ve seen no real progression, and it pisses me off that I have wasted so much time, and I blame no one but myself for not taking time to do proper research. I’ve chalked it up to a few things:

Diet: I never was keeping track of what I was eating, and I really can’t be eating so much since Im apart of a relatively big family and can’t be eating, say 3-5 eggs for breakfast a day. I also am pretty limited to whatever my parents make for dinner. As for breakfast and lunch, I have been eating things such as oatmeal, cottage cheese, eggs, etc + breakfast at school as it’s now free where I live.

Weight, reps, sets: I mentioned the weight I’ve been using earlier, and as for reps I’ve been trying 6-8 for 4 sets, but I’m unsure if any of this is right as I find my arms giving out way to early into the sets for an exercise.

Days spent lifting: I’ve always lifted weights Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but I’m considering lifting weights 5 days out of the week instead of just three.

At this point, I’m basically still a beginner. I could use any advice from anyone out there, as I have no idea how to get efficient results. Any critiques, plans, and help will be greatly appreciated."
"Diet gets easier the longer you stick to it Start of 2021 I stood on a scale and what I saw woke me up, 57KG... I’ve been working on a few projects lately so my full focus on them, I was eating 1-2 meals per day. 

I decided to start eating 3 meals per day, which also includes a 1000 shake in the morning. 

At the beginning it was super hard, it took me a full day to eat those 3 meals, and I felt full often not even finishing the meal. 

Now, almost 3 months in and 5KG gained (62kg), I eat those meals easily plus snacks in between, my stomach feels great too! I used to suffer in the mornings because my stomach just felt bloated and I had no appetite, now I feel hungry and can easily drink that shake. 

The reason why I’m telling you this, is that it’s my 4th try, and every time I quit due to feeling unmotivated as a result of struggling to eat. Just stick to it, it gets better!"
"Looking for additional fats I’d say like I eat very well and while I could work out more intensely, I think i stimulate myself enough to be gaining muscle especially as I work on my form. I’m looking for more fats that I can add into my diet especially in the morning with something quick. Anyone have any tips? I currently eat a bagel with half cream cheese and half peanut butter and I’m considering adding an oatmeal with peanut butter mixed in. Maybe even some brown sugar in it.
Also I read everyone saying olive oil but ya boy is on a budget and I go with the vegetable oil/corn oil since there’s way more and it’s less expensive. Does that defeat the purpose or is that just Big Olive Oil trucking me into spending a bunch of money?"
"Dirty bulked for ~3 months but still have abs I’ve gained 25+ lbs in 3 months (even after newbie gains) during my dirty bulk. I don’t know why so many on this sub are against it, if you’re a pure ectomorph and it’s easier and cheaper for you, dirty bulking is a viable option. In my case I didn’t really “lose my abs”. Never really cared about abs anyways. I literally just hit my protein and calorie goal every day and ate whatever I wanted. Results: https://imgur.com/gallery/Bxsg6D4

Edit: I would still drink soda or eat candy some days too but I never added it to my daily calorie tracker because they’re “empty calories”."
"Should I put more emphasis on the amount of food I'm eating or the quality of the food? 

I'll start off with a bit of information:
I am a 16 year old male who is trying to gain weight and tone up. I am currently 6'4"" and weigh around 143 pounds (I know, I'm underweight). 

I work out 6 days a week on average and my routine consists of:

• Pushups (around 50 throughout the day)

• Crunches (2 sets of 25)

• Leg raises ( 2 sets of 30)

• One minute plank

• V sit ups (3 sets of 10)

• Bicep curls (3 sets of 8)

• Squats (3 sets of 10)

Now for the main point of this post. I obviously need to gain weight and my goal is to get to around 160 pounds or so. Should I just be eating as much as possible without taking the quality and health benefits of the food into consideration, or should I be eating nutritious meals?

Edit: and to add, if I eat too much ""unhealthy"" food will it cause me to gain fat and make it difficult to build muscle?"
"Dumbbell bench in place of Barbell bench? Next week I’m looking to switch my program, currently doing a bro split of sorts, and I haven’t been able to do barbell at least confidently due to no spotter.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know I can ask a fellow gym member but I’d rather not.

Point is, my chest has consistently gotten bigger doing dumbbell but all these programs call for barbell bench.

For reference my 1RM for barbell (last time I checked was last monthish was around 125)

Can I just do dumbbell bench in place of barbell?

Edit - 18M, 5’ 8”, 135lbs"
"I have 2 problems gaining; one, I seem to have to choose between eating my maintenance cals and sleep; two, nobody around me seems to even grasp the concept Not much else to say.

Or superset shoulders and legs together? Does it really matter in what order I work out or should I do all leg exercises first then all shoulder exercises next?"
"How have I lost so much weight 2 weeks since the end of my bulk? I’m a really skinny guy so this past November I decided to start bulking.

"I need to gain weight but eating a lot makes me sluggish which drastically reduces my productivity All is said in the title. I am trying to eat 3000 calories per day i have a fast metabolism and I don't gain weight easily. After 2 weeks in the diet my appetite started to adjust which is great but what hasn't is the sluggish feeling after eating. It's becoming a huge problem for my work, I need to be able to mentally focus. I eat a big breakfast (consisting usually of eggs and oatmeal) then immediately feel sleepy and can't focus at all.

I am at top perfomance when i'm fasting. As long as i didn't eat anything during the day my brain is super sharp and focused. Once I eat, i'm feeling sluggish.

"Minimal Progress--Why? Hi all, I humbly request advice.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a 20 year old college student. I've been ""seriously"" training since summer of 2019, so about 1.5 years now. I got my numbers up (starting from the bar) for about a semester before that first summer, but didn't really have any idea about nutrition or programming. I didn't have much sports background before, and was very skinny (5'8 138 lb), so I essentially started from nothing. I made OK progress initially (both visually and strength). I lost record of my numbers, but by September 2020, my SBD was likely around 300/190/(spent a long time practicing form for deadlifts), at 168 lb. Up till this point, I was using the nSuns 5 day routine, but had seen diminishing returns and it was getting boring, so I switched to the CoolCicada PPL routine, but kept the nSuns squat layout for the leg days. 

&amp;nbsp;

By November, I had gotten my squat to a max of 345 once (highest working set was 315x4 a week before that max attempt), and bench didn't really increase much--I did 205 with poor, grindy form once, but from September to November, general working sets for the heavier bench day only went from 155 5x5 to 165 5x5. Continued practicing deadlifts and got closer to 300 with solid form.

&amp;nbsp;

I was slightly depressed/lethargic at home for break, and did a couple of weeks of traveling with just body weight exercises, so I pretty much just maintained until January, still doing the PPL routine. Since I had been bulking for the entirety of my lifting journey and was getting a bit fluffier at 177lb, I decided to cut, and since I was not really seeing much progress with a linear program, I also concurrently began Candito's 6 week ""intermediate"" program mixed with his bench program since I needed more practice with bench. Starting that program, I entered my 1RMs at 320/200/300, since I was still feeling slightly rusty from winter break. Currently in the middle of week 5 of the program (and of my cut), and I've lost 8-9 pounds back to 168, and my strength is pretty much the same as 5 weeks before, which is fine. I have to admit, I rarely tracked calories when I bulked--I ate similar whole foods daily, and was gaining weight at a relatively slow pace. Since starting my cut, I've been eating around 2k-2.1k calories daily, about 180g P, 200g C, and 50g F, and walking to and from campus a total of 3 miles 5 days a week.

&amp;nbsp;

During the previous few weeks and last semester, I would never miss a training session, try my best during those sessions, am cognizant about improving form, would eat in a surplus with enough protein, sleep an average of 7 hours, and have done a lot of research on nutrition and training. Yet, I'm not satisfied with my progress both visually and strength-wise. Week to week, I'm not so discouraged by my strength not increasing, since I understand it takes time, but looking back at the last 6+ months, it is a bit disheartening to see minimal progress even as I (think I) put in the work. I compared a progress pictures in the same lighting, pose, and no-pump from today and October, and I can see essentially no difference. I understand progress typically slows as one trains for longer, but seeing as how I'm still so early on my journey, I expected more significant change. Obviously, I'm not giving up and will continue to train with intent.

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice or recommended resources? I'd love to hear some perspectives on how to move forward, and welcome any and all critiques as long as it's constructive. My current goals are to build a more substantive muscular base and improve strength. Thank you all very much!"

"What to go buy at grocery store? I’m a high school almost college student and I’ve been trying to pack on some pounds for a while now but my biggest problem is my diet. I love working out and go to the gym almost every day but I never eat enough calories, especially for how many I burn. 

My parents don’t really understand the importance of what I eat and my muscle growth so I want to start getting my own groceries to buy the right meals and snacks and possibly even meal prep.

Nutrition and dieting is nowhere near my strong suit so I’d really appreciate some tips or lists of what y’all like to eat and especially snack on during the day to pack on some pounds.

PS. I’m 6’3 170lbs (77.1 kg) if that helps.

"Am I Overdoing it? First post so forgive me. I follow a modified 6 day PPL routine where my workouts generally last about 2 hours, sometimes longer. I generally try to aim for 5-6 exercises per muscle group of 4 sets each and realized this may be excessive and hindering my muscle growth. I'm about 6'3 and 200 pounds but still feel pretty skinny. I've upped weights in my bench, squat, etc. over the past few months but I feel like I may be overdoing it. Recently, I realized I should be doing front delts with my push day and Rear delts with my pull day.

I always feel like I'm doing something wrong when I tell someone my workouts usually last this long and they look at me weird. I don't take obnoxiously long rest times (45 seconds-1.5 mins depending on heavy/accessory work). 

My fear is this is what my body has become accustomed to so taking it back a scale wouldn't help much. The recommended programs I see online/here seem to only hit chest with 3 exercises on a pull day which seems light to me, especially as a weak point of mine but open to suggestions!"
"How far past my calorie goal can I healthily go while bulking if still hungry? This may have the simple stupid answer of just: yes keep eating. 

My calculated TDEE is around 3,250 calories and my daily goal has been 3,700. Not every night, but on some nights I will go to bed feeling hungry as hell, even if I had just eaten my final 500ish calorie meal just an hour or two prior. If I have already met my goal for the day, is it bad or pushing me into more of a dirty bulk territory if I eat another snack and go like 700-900 calories over TDEE? Or should I always just listen to my body in the sense that if it wants food I should give it food. 

I just don't want to end up overeating and my weight gain to turn into fat because I am going way over the 500 calorie surplus, but I am relatively new to all of this so maybe this isn't even an issue."
"Do you reduce calories on non-training days? I've tried various bits of bulking over the years, but being honest never taken it seriously enough and therefore not had much success.

I'm about to start again, and giving it serious attention this time. Previously I've always kept my calories/macros the same on both training and non-training days as a few people had told me before this was the best approach as the body is still recovering/growing on non-training days too.

Is that the right approach? I've seen the odd thing online that suggests reducing them on non-training days so wanted to check it"

But don't eat like you're a 13 year old coz you supposedly  'can't get the calories from healthy food.'"
"Routine for woman wanting to join Infantry, get stronger and bulk up? I am a 5’5, 125lbs woman who is looking to join the British army in a few years. I have always aspired to do a combat role and my ultimate goal would be infantry. Now I am an amateur boxer so have the cardio side mostly covered, What I am lacking in is strength. 

I did stronglifts 5x5 for a few months when I was very underweight to bulk up and loved it. Got my OHP to 27.5, deadlift to 75kg. 

What would be the best routine to add strength and mass for me to cope with physical demands, and is it realistic to gain much size and strength in 1 to 2 years.

Should I go back to stronglifts? I am worried the squats will be too much considering all the boxing training. And what do you reckon would be a good weight for me to not compromise my cardio but become much stronger?"
What do you do for conditioning? Might be a slightly stupid question but I'm struggling to come up with anything decent as conditioning to compliment resistance training. What do you guys do as conditioning? Would a body weight style circuit count as conditioning or is that just cardio? Suggestions for limited equipment would be appreciated
"What should be my ideal proportions? Taken these measurements before I ate / morning :

"Anyone know what sort of math is used in the nSuns TDEE spreadsheet? It seems wildly inaccurate. I've been using the spreadsheet for the past 3 weeks, and so far the TDEE it was spitting out seemed sort of reasonable. But then I got curious and decided to add a month of false numbers.  
  
Right now I'm sitting at 160 lbs and eating 3170 calories a day. It says my TDEE is 2900. I'm not expecting that to be overwhelmingly accurate after 3 weeks. But anyway, I entered a ***full five weeks*** of 160 lbs and eating 3170 calories. You'd think it'd increase my TDEE from 2900 to around 3150, yes? Five weeks of eating 3170 calories and staying the exact same weight, right? Instead, it increased it from 2900 to 2925.  
  
That doesn't seem right."
"Where is the nuance? For most of my teenage life, I subsisted off of pizza rolls, coca cola, and popcorn almost every day. I had very little appetite, and mostly ate junk food. I remained super skinny, around 100-105 lbs at 5'7"" M until I turned 17, when I started realizing I was skinny af and extremely unhealthy. 

I'm curious where the nuance is though. When going on a bulk, everyone always says stuff like ""Don't eat too much junk food!"", or ""No McDonalds! Too much sodium!"", ""Don't eat that much ice cream!"" etc... But does it really matter? In terms of gains. Does it really matter?

If I hit my protein goal, 1500 calories of meat - 120g of protein, and the rest of my calories (1500 more) I make up with ice cream, mcdonalds, chips -- whatever. Does it matter? Aside from the potential health issues associated with high sugar/high sodium etc, do the gains change? Is this the idea of CICO?"
"[progress] 164 -&gt; 177 [pic](https://ibb.co/5jDXGk1) (tattoo gains not guaranteed)
Forgot to add some things to the title. M, 5'11

Ok I’m technically 176.6 lol but yesterday I was 176.8 so I’m calling it 177. I’m 31 yrs old. By October after the gyms had been shut for going on 6 months I felt so ashamed of my physique, I had been living a lazy lifestyle and drinking way, way too much and sleeping in. Gyms opened back up and I started hitting the gym consistently, gained 5lb in about a month and started feeling good again. Then before I knew it, gyms shut down again, and I promptly lost those gains.

Mid-January came around and the gyms were back open. I’ve hit the gym 22 times in the last 40 days and am seeing some results. I’m on Kinobody’s Greek God program, which is a 3 day split. It’s more or less a pull, push, legs/traps split. I decided 3x a week wasn’t enough for me so I’m adding in another 1-2 days a week for mobility, and to do a little extra neck and traps work. Working neck is something I overlooked for years. My neck’s gained an inch and I think it really enhances the physique."

What I Ate because this is r/gainit:

 I did shakes at the beginning but never twice a day and they never amounted over 1k calories probably because laziness. After about 2-3 months I transitioned fully into drinking half a gallon of fairlife milk a day, since then it’s basically been impossible for me to miss protein any day. If anything I tend to go way overboard and have been working on cutting back protein intake. I also made sure to get 4-8 servings of vegetables everyday (mostly spinach) because they made me feel good. Boring chicken and rice a lot but I’ve never really cared about what I ate before so it didn’t matter much to me as long as I hit my macros. I ate 3-6 eggs everyday because I read somewhere they’re filled with micros and immediately trusted that source. I work a physical job so easy access foods were important for those 8 hours, this is when I drank the milk and ate about 900 calories worth of almonds, cashews, and dark chocolate. I incorporated variety at some points but milk, nuts, dark chocolate, eggs, chicken, rice, and spinach were the most frequently consumed foods. I also tracked my calories pretty religiously for 4/5 months but in the past month I’ve gotten lazy and am still gaining around the right amount so that’s nice. 

What I do at the gym:

Slight case of fuckarounditis but I do go to the gym 5 days a week doing a PPLUL split and I train very very hard. Also did 0 direct ab training in this time.

Thoughts about gaining so far:

I can’t stress how much I prefer not having to hear how skinny I am everyday, that was pretty annoying. Other guys seem to respond better to me now, the girl response is mostly the same as before. Around maybe 10ish people in my day to day life have noticed, and like 3/4 ar the gym I go to regularly. I think I’m going to go to 160 and then cut for the summer, but that depends on my satisfaction with my lifts. For some reason I don’t care that much about the bulk belly I have or the fat I gained despite family members pointing it out all the time. Overall I would rate gaining 25 pounds as a positive experience.

Drugs:

None obviously except I did smoke weed once with a friend and ate like $50 worth of sashimi and sushi by myself."
"Ideal weight for 6 foot guy Currently bulking right now, I’m at 186lbs right at barely 6 feet tall but still looking kind of slender. I’m working out 5 days a week and have only been doing so for about 3 months. The plan was to bulk to 200 then cut to 190 but I just looking for a second opinion on what weight I can look huge at. I want to be lean but I don’t want to be a slim lean. Should I stay at 200lbs?

I also don’t have very much muscle right now as those 3 months entail my lifelong gym journey lol. So I’m relatively new to this whole bulking and cutting thing."
"5 Hour Workouts, Am I The Only One I only have 1 day off and do a full body workout in a single session. I do a high volume workout and can lift nearly the same amount of weight per reps as if I were doing a push/pull split. 

With the consensus being not to workout longer than an hour at a time due to spikes in cortisol and such, do any of you do 3 hour+ workouts and still gain steadily?"
"Which routine helped you pack on a lot of muscle? Hi Guys,

I have been working out for a couple of months (five to be precise) now.

Was on a 5x5 strength training routine. While I didn’t gain a lot of mass, I do believe I have set a good foundation to move on to a bodybuilding/ bulking routine.

What routine in your opinion works best for support a clean bulk?

If this question has been asked before, I do apologize. You can paste the link and I’ll read up.

Thanks

PS. Am 6 feet tall. Started at a measly 59-60kg. Currently hovering around 65kg. 7% BF"
"What have been your biggest exercises or techniques for legs Just curious what exercises, methods, or techniques helped you guys put the most mass or increase strength on your lower body."
"Cut and repair Been bulking for a measly two months. Using a custom (but sensible) upper/lower/rest three day cycle. Working so far as I've gained FAT, yes, but also muscle, which despite the short time period is noticeable on the leaner areas (biceps, quads etc.). Eating a 500 calorie daily surplus and intend to keep the bulk up for a total six months.

&amp;#x200B;

Two minor problems:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A little more fat gain than I'd like (need to get fat on a bulk, but to be fair I think I was a bit fat when I started, just carried it well on a tallish frame)
2. Some niggly pains at various joints/tendons/ligaments; not major, but nonetheless a sign of stress

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of resting for half a week, resuming, then seeing how I feel. If niggles persist, I will take off another half week. If still persisting, a full week. Still working on form and conditioning the body so hope that these minor pains will eventually fade. Have at times been guilty of lifting too heavy too quickly (not sensible).

During this lower intensity period I will reduce to a caloric deficit as though I was cutting, although keeping reasonably high protein for muscle maintenance.

Essentially I am initiating a (very) miniature cut/repair phase, then resuming the bulk. Depending on fat gain/joint pains, may repeat this every month (half a week) or every two months (full week).

Is this sensible? I'm a beginner, although instinct tells me this could be worth it in the long-term. Obviously concerned about losing muscle gains, and whilst I'm not really believing that this is a danger with such a minor change, would be nice to hear others' opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for feedback."
"Lunch prep - chicken problem... Hey,

So I’ve got my breakfast routine sorted. Posted previously about breakfast prep, and since discovered burritos. 100g beef, 2 x eggs &amp;amp; peppers, 1 x hash brown, cheese, hot sauce, tortilla. Bulk prep. In the freezer. Done for the week. Awesome. Circa. 550 calories, 45g protein each. Mixed with my breakfast shake, it’s circa. 1,100 calories and 85g protein before I’ve even got to midday.

However, mind is now going to how to improve lunches and prep for them (as work full time). They’re ok at the moment, but could be better and less time consuming. Don’t want a huge lunch as would prefer to have bigger dinner after all the calories at breakfast. To fit in with my goals, lunch only needs to be around 400/500 calories and 30g protein.

One of the big things that puts me off prepping a week of lunches is I really despise the taste of reheated microwave chicken.

Are there any recipes that you can suggest that avoid this? Or any general tips? Maybe my pre-prepared chicken needs to be in a sauce / broth kind of situation to avoid / mask that awful dry / chemical taste when reheating chicken? Or maybe I should just stick with another meat? But just don’t want to be eating beef 3 x times a day as that will get old. Turkey I’m not a fan of at all. I do like ham though but not sure it’s the best meat for bulking?

Any advice appreciated!"
"After 2 months of barely any results following LeanGains, I'm going to start a proper bulk [https://imgur.com/E4B6G0l](https://imgur.com/E4B6G0l)

Picture on the far left is about 6 months ago, middle picture is 2 months ago, and right picture was from yesterday.

I started my ""fitness journey"" after my break-up about 6 months ago.  I lost 30 lbs following IF 16:8 and doing some kind of physical activity daily (i.e., Greyskull LP with accessories &amp; cardio).  2 months ago I hit my ""goal weight"" and was starting to follow the LeanGains methodology to pack on some muscle.  Unfortunately, in those 2 months I haven't seen much progress; my lifting numbers and PRs have gone up, but not a lot of physical changes.  I have been eating at a very slight surplus with 1 gram of protein per body weight (i.e., 140 grams).

I'm going to start a ""classic"" bulk of 500 surplus calories daily.  Going from eating less to lose weight to eating a lot more to gain muscle has been a challenge, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.

I'm following 5/3/1 for Beginners now with a fair amount of accessories.

EDIT: Am I still considered ""skinny fat"" or am I just ""skinny"" now?"
"[Progress] M/24/6’3’’ | 162 lbs - 177 lbs | November - February Hi everyone, yesterday marked exactly 3 months of my fitness and gaining routine, so I thought I’d share my progress so far. 

https://imgur.com/a/7J0Ne0x (last 3 pics are within 2 days of each other, just different lighting) 

I don’t track my calories to the exact amount, but always make sure I’m getting above 3k per day, and usually around 180-200 grams of protein. My diet is nothing different than the hundreds of posts you see on this subreddit, so not gonna touch on that, but I will say that mass gainer shakes helped out immensely the first month or so when adjusting to a bigger diet. 

Lifts
——-

Unfortunately I have only had access to a smith machine so can’t really compare these numbers to a true barbell lift, but: 

Bench: 145 1rm - 215 1rm

Squat: 185 1rm - 265 1rm 

I’ve noticed consistent growth in all of the accessory lifts I’ve done as well so happy about that. 

Routine
————-
4 day split:

-Chest and Tris 

-Back and Bis

-Legs

-Shoulders, Bis and Tris

-Rest


Goals
———

Short term (Daily/Weekly)

-Weigh myself every morning to get a consistent weekly average of weight 

-Hit 3200+calories per day or more depending on weight measurements

-Gain between .5lb-1lb per week


Medium Term: (3-12 months)

-Hit a true 225 bench press

-Hit a true 315 squat 

-Hit 190 weight 

-Join a new gym with free barbells so I can incorporate deadlift and OHP into my routine 


Long term: (1 year +)

-200 lb weight

-successfully go through a gaining/cutting cycle 
-1000 lb club 


Conclusion
——————
Overall I’ve learned a lot the last 3 months thanks to this subreddit and my brother who is an advanced lifter. I’m happy with the gains I’ve made in all of my lifts and looking forward to hitting new goals that I set for myself. Also thinking about joining the lifting party on March 1 and riding that out for the next 3-6 months!"
"1m81 70kg/154lbs need help after dirty bulk Hello everyone, today I post here to explain my particular situation and to maybe get some help!
I'm 18yo and have always been really skinny (like really) and I decided to go to the gym since 1.5years now and went from around 55kg to 70kg. (1m76-77 -&gt; 1m81
The problem is that I did gain a lot of muscle but I also gained some FAT.
I was more around 11% bf before and now I'm more at like 15% and I feel like it starts to be a bit too much.

The thing is that I want to lose this extra fat so I know that I should just go on a fat loss.
The thing is that I don't want to be back to like low 60kgs because I would be so skinny again and I just don't want to be THAT skinny anymore.
Honestly, having a bodyfat of around 11% would be perfectly fine for me but I'm really afraid of losing all my gains.
It may be obvious but I have a fast metabolism which means that it was always hard for me to bulk.

I know that my situation is hard to deal with but if you could help in any way, I would be really thankful.
Have a great day, thanks"
Results from 3 months of lifting? After running cross country for 6 years I decided to gain some muscle for the track season. Do the changes I have so far look normal or do I need to increase my calories more to gain muscle? [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/k4TwGSt)
"Is progressive overload necessary for hypertrophy? I recently bought a squat rack and bench with an Olympic barbell over lockdown as I was sick of not being able to go to the gym.

I was just wondering if I can still gain decent muscle mass from 50kg max without the progressive overload of heavier weights?"

"Favorite non-dairy protein powder? I, unfortunately, am lactose intolerant.  Even Lactaid won't help.  I've tried multiple protein powders but still haven't found my number one.  I'm a huge chocolate person, so I'd love to find something delicious and in the chocolate realm.

So far, I've tried:

True Nutrition (awesome, but even on the lightest sweetened amount it tastes like sweetener, and their flavors aren't great), Orgain (not bad, but doesn't desolve great), Isopure (expensive, but good), Vega (currently using and pretty good).  So far these have been my main go-to's but I'm looking for some new delicious non-dairy protein powders.  Would appreciate any  recommendations!  TIA

Also, I've tried the OWYN drink, but not the powder.  Curious if the powder tastes the same, if anyone has tried it before...

"Not sure what to do at first day at gym? Helloooo. I'm a 19M that's previously suffered from eating disorders but yay -- I'm finally on the road to recovery! Now that my eating is somewhat organized, I've decided to really turn my life around by getting into shape. I'm currently 105lb at 5'10"" (yeah, I know it's *insanely low* but I'm aiming to eat 2500+ now. For over six months I was at 1500 cal/day so this is a pretty dramatic improvement) and know that I have extremely low muscle mass, so I'm planning on following this routine for my first weeks at the gym: [https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/) . Because I'm pretty weak atm, I'm just planning on using the bar alone today to get a feel for the exercises and gradually add on plates.

As you can see, workout A (today's plan) is nine sets. That's going to be a great start but I can't imagine it will take more than 20 minutes? What else should I do for my workout? I'm planning to eat a rice/chicken meal a few hours beforehand so I definitely want to put that protein to use. If anybody has any recommendations I would really really appreciate it.

Training after glandular fever 3 weeks ago I first noticed i had glandular fever and it kept me in bed for about a week struggling.

But getting back on subject. This is my first cut and I recently decided to cut down to 175lbs from 200lbs. Im dropping my calories from 2,300 to 1,660 and making sure I get around 130g of protein daily to help minimize strength loss.

I work out 5-6 days a week so that means I'm Benching and squatting 3-4x a week. I love the progress I have been making and the idea that I might be losing strength/ Not being able to handle the volume bothers me a little but is something I can accept.

Im sure I will be able to continue making gains on my squats and deads considering they are so low. But I'm curious about more ways to increase my bench during my cut if the volume starts to become too taxing. I want to reach a 330 Bench by july.

P.s My Deads and Squats are low because I injured my lower back due to bad form from both. I decided to drop my weight very low to focus on my form and build from there. I also switched my squats to Highbar ATG and I love how it feels now."
"Hi guys. Can you still build muscle whilst training for ultramarathons? 50 miles per week is about 5000 calorie for a 150 lb guy. 

If those calories are replaced, alongside 1g protein per lb, with a solid resistance training program, how will the running affect muscle gain?

"How to deal with appetite ""setbacks""? Hey guys! I \[21/M/5'9""/115 lbs\] have  been struggling for about 6 or so years now to gain weight since my  growth spurt stopped. While I have tried calorie packing countless  times, I have never really had success. However, I have recently found  myself being able to eat and drink many more calories recently. While I  don't want to dwell too much, I think that this may be due to having  online college classes and having more time than ever to cook full meals  that I enjoy. Usually, I have felt too rushed to eat much for breakfast  at all, but nowadays, I have a routine of eating a sizeable breakfast  every day (a few eggs, toast, butter, and sometimes yogurt), and I have  also started drinking 2-4 cups of whole fat chocolate milk per day  (which I hope to increase over the next coming weeks).

My  experience tells me however that I will soon probably lose the ability  to stuff myself everyday no matter how hard I try since I start to enjoy  even the thought of food less and less with how much I am eating. I  feel like there might be a point where my appetite starts to increase  again if I continue to push myself, but my appetite has usually  significantly dropped off before this theoretical point.

How  do I avoid succumbing to this setback like I have pretty much always  done? While it is relatively easy for me to eat 3 large meals with  snacks in between per day at the moment, I know that this can wake up  any day with a totally different appetite which ultimately derails the  streak that I am on."
"feeling extremely low energy all the time and i dont know why i gained about 60lbs in a year and a half, at 6'5 i used to be 163, now im around 225. i sleep at least 9 hours a day and maintain my weight at roughly 3k calories, most of my food being protein but i do eat a lot of the same meals day in day out. im only 22 and i feel a solid 4/10 on energy basically every day. i work out 5 days a week and preworkout does nothing to me anymore, even though i take it once a week. i rarely do cardio so maybe it could be that? i really dont know anymore. can anyone else relate?"

"Is 10lbs muscle loss due to inactivity possible? 
Hi,

24M 5’7 135 lbs

Wanted to ask for some opinions:

I used to work out at least twice a week for my entire life (have been lifting recreationally since I’m 15) and was stable at around 145 lbs that way. Now after last March everything changed and I stopped working out almost completely.

I started having some GI problems around March too that I still have to this date. Now my question is: how realistic is it to lose 10 lbs of muscle/glycogen/water over this period?

I look at myself in the mirror today and can barely recognize myself. My legs look very skinny and my arms too. I wasn’t swole by any means, but I was definitely in decent shape (no visible abs, but solid back and arms for example).

I’ve been worried that all this weight I’ve lost has been from my GI issues, but I just realized some of it could be muscle too.

Did anyone else lose such a large amount of mass just from not working out during 2020?

Cheers!"

Hey guys it’s me again lmao if any of you remember me from over six months ago! 

Conversions for metric people: 56-72.3kg

For my routine, I just roughly follow the r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine and added some dumbbell exercises with adjustable weights for progressive overload. Feel free to DM or comment to ask more haha. Also, I dance three times a week for around 2-3 hours each time. 

Honestly for me I just workout every other day before I sleep, and with school and everything I can’t be bothered to follow a full on routine with what some of you guys have here. For me I just want to establish the habit of working out and enjoying it so in the future I can take up different routines more easily and progress from there. I’m still 16 and I don’t want to put so much thought into this just yet so this is me not really taking this whole thing overly seriously. 

In the last post, (it’s in my profile still you guys can go check haha) some of you guys commented on the carb/sugar stuff so I really tried to watch that. I lost some weight after that to cut down on the fat and now I’m trying to gain weight again but I’m being more careful this time. What really helps for me recently was weighing everyday to see if I was gaining a sensible amount. 

For 2021, I really made it a point to not skip workouts or at least get something in on my workout days, since consistency is so important and it’s something I lacked last year which slowed my progress. 

Right now I’m still trying to gain weight but I’m really watching the fat and I’ll cut down once summer nears. 

I hope my post inspires someone to at least start or helps anyone low on motivation 

Thanks for reading, and once again, until next time!"
"Push, pull, legs question I have been doing PPL program for about 4 months now and it works for me pretty well. On my push day, for chest I do flat bench press and dips. 


I tried implementing incline bench press too but its too much for me in one day.


Since I do push, pull, legs workout twice a week, should I do flat bench press on one day and incline on another or should I just go with doing both on the same day, twice a week?"

"Lockdown losses I had been working out and gaining sucessfully last year but than my country went into lockdown again just before Christmas. So I got myself some sand bags to continue training at home but of course despite similar eating I already lost 2kg (average compared to average) in the 1,5 months its been now.. Looks like its virtually impossible for my skinny self to hold onto any weight. Despite actually moving less and sitting more besides the training. How do people get fat during lockdown..?

"How do you guys deal with the constant feeling of bloating etc? [16M] I have recently made an attempt to regain some of my lost weight (176-&gt;152) and am finding it very hard.

Yes the weight is coming back on but I consistently feel like a slab of lard with excessive water retention, especially on rest days- How does everyone else deal with this?"
"Having an issue with squats. Hi all, I come seeking advice and wisdom for helping me with a new problem with squats. TL;DR at the bottom but I feel the whole story may help out in finding an answer.

Up unto February of last year I could squat fine no problem and had a one rep of 245 (yea not the best I know). That February though I injured my back, doing squats coincidentally (lost tension in my core because I lost focus and rounded my back forward with 205lb on), and had to take about 5 months off the gym. I was in the worse back pain I'd ever had and it still bothers me most days.

I started back at the gym early August last year and have only really gotten back into ""heavy"" weights about two months ago. Things are going fine for the most part, but I notice now when I squat, on the come up my knees buckle and go inwards into each other. Like I'll get down to full depth fine but coming back up my legs are like a newborn deer, with my knees always caving into each other/wobbling. Not sure how else to describe it so sorry for the vague description.

I've tried doing more hip flexor exercises as well as lower back work and volume days (5x12) for squats but the problem persists. It's holding me back a good bit. Even today I wanted to test where my one rep was at and even with only 185lb my knees/legs were wobbling. At 205 I couldn't get back up at all. Any idea where I'm lagging or what I should be working on?

TL;DR: Knees weak and buckling inwards despite not happening before. Not sure what to do to rectify."
"I just have a single dumbbell. Can I keep doing one-arm bench presses/ rows / flys / overhead presses? I'm in poverty mode currently and will be for the rest of the year. Fortunately, I got a used 40lb dumbbell and flat bench for $30. I haven't worked out in a year and 1RM bench was like 275.  I'm trying to get back to working out. I have a pull up bar and can do body-weight exercises.

Except for the fly, I'm able to do one-arm exercises with everything else. Is it okay if I keep doing the one-arm presses/rows? Given that I only have a single weight, do I just increase the reps?  Will I be able to gain some muscles this way?

Edit: Oooof, power went out for 3 days. Thanks everyone for the advice."
"Frequency vs volume : 6 sets 3 times a week OR 3 sets 6 times a week? Asking for a friend who is looking for an intermediate workout routine.

He was doing a full body workout 3 times a week with 4 compound exercises having 3-4 sets and 5-10 reps each with 1 or 2 accessories exercises thrown in between if he felt like it.

Now he wants to increase the load as according to him he doesn't seems to be making any progress anymore even after deloading and increasing calorie intake.

He has shortlisted two options but cant decide which of these is better. 

Option 1 - Increase the sets from 3 to 6 per exercise.

Option 2 - Keep the workout same but do it 5-6 times a week instead of 3. (Inspired from jeff nippard's 5 times a week full body workout)

Now dont you dare say whichever is more enjoyable. He is not a beginner and has no difficulty getting to the gym."
Switching from calisthenics/gymnastics to weightlifting. Program to catch my lower body up with upper. Hi all I am a 27yo M at 190lb 6’ 3”. Long story short been training calisthenics and rings for over 2 years and just got a gym membership. Looking to add a lot of size to my lower body and increase my squat and deadlift a lot.

"Switch to 5/3/1 for Beginners? So I started working out seriously after building a home gym and for the past 3 months I did Stronglifts 5x5 and then Greyskull LP. I’ve gotten a stronger compared to my lifts when I first started. However, lately its been feeling boring doing 5x5 or 3x5 with weights close to my max. The only part that I enjoy is when doing the AMRAP sets in the Greyskull routine. I just like feeling that pump and burn from doing more reps with little rest time between sets. Basically what I’m asking, would 5/3/1 for beginners be a smart change to make based on what I’m looking for in a workout? My overall goal is to just get gain muscle, some strength, and enjoy my workouts"

Best alternatives for people who don't eat beef/red meat? I don't eat cow products for environmental reasons. I've been fine with alternative milks and cheeses but beef is a staple of bulking food.

"[Progress] M/23/5'9 110lbs (50kg) - 160lbs (72.5kg) (3 years) (Crohn's disease) EDIT: I realize this may look overwhelming for some of you, whether you have a chronic disease or not.  It took time, dedication, and a huge amount of effort. During my journey, I had brutal complications, multiple surgeries, kept starting from pretty much zero a number of times. My family (my mother) and I were extremely in debt and on the verge of hunger. I battled identity issues, a financial crisis, OCD and intrusive thoughts, depression, PTSD, and even schizo symptoms. My moods have stabilized along the way, but I suspect I might be bipolar as well. All I'm trying to say is, I had/have a shit ton of problems, just like all you guys, and working out has always been my healthy escape of choice, and even if I procrastinated all day I'd still drop and do 10 sets of push-ups.

Accept what you've been given but never give up on yourself, even if everyone else has, and the Universe will comply with your willpower and dreams.

Hi guys, back with another annual progress thread!

This is a follow-up from this post I made two years ago where you can read more about me and my story: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress\_m2159\_110lbs\_50kg\_152lbs\_69kg\_1\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress_m2159_110lbs_50kg_152lbs_69kg_1_year/)

**Since the last post, I've gained another 4 lbs this year and have made huge strength and aesthetic gains.**

I still eat the exact same stuff as stated in my post from a year back. However, I sometimes incorporate pork and the odd ""cheat meal"" from time to time, which tend to cause me issues the following days. I won't be doing this anymore from now.

I've since learned that it's important to be grateful for what you CAN eat, even if it's not much. And also the fact that I live a (mostly) pain-free life without meds after my surgeries and daily routine consisting of eating the same foods and taking turmeric, Boswellia, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, propolis, Salmon fish oil, creatine, L-glutamine, working out (and lots of walking outdoors), and a regular sleeping schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

**My workout routine has changed significantly:**

* 10 sets of my max push-ups and shrugs per day (with a tiny 40lbs dumbbell held in both hands, need to upgrade asap). I do this for two days in a row. So about 350-400 push-ups and shrugs with perfect form, really taking my time to do the exercise rather than just chasing numbers.
* 10 sets of my max super wide-grip TOWEL pull-ups and bicep curls. I am going to post a pic later of how I set it up at home. So about 70-80 pull-ups and 50-60 curls with a 40lbs dumbbell. Incredible strength gains in my back, forearms, fingers, and grip overall.

That's it. I do a lot of walking for my legs and also some basic mobility exercises with a resistance band, one-legged calf ""jumping"" raises, and jumping lunges.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some word of advice after many years of doing this:**

* Do stuff that's hard. The numbers don't matter and are subjective. If you can't do more than 5 push-ups in one go, doing 50 per day is going to skyrocket your gains in the next month, then you can move on to more and more to continue offering the same challenge to your body as before
* Perfect form every single time. Humping the ground or looking like you're doing the worm will do little to help you advance along the way. 20 reps with perfect form are way better than 40 half-assed attempts
* For those with digestive issues - calculate your calories needed to bulk up, then experiment until you find your safe foods. Blood tests may be needed regularly at first to make sure you're not increasing your inflammation levels. I'm lucky to be able to eat white bread and not be gluten intolerant, I can't tolerate most fats, but I can eat a shit ton of tahini (sesame paste), so the majority of my calories come from there. The rest are from chicken and rice. I don't calculate macros, but they're probably something like 45% carbs, 35% fats, 20% protein
* If you're easily bored with long, varied routines like me (I know that's a paradox in itself) just find a few exercises that really work well for you and spam the shit out of them
* Researchers constantly come up with contradicting studies. Don't go down the rabbit hole of listening to dudes that spend more time researching the best way to gain muscle and then arguing about it over actually working out. All of those that I know irl think I'm fucking with them when I tell them that I don't go to the gym and only do push-ups and pull-ups

P.S. Can't recommend shaving your head and growing some facial hair enough! I used to be super-feminine looking but now just looking at myself in the mirror finally gives me satisfaction and a ""damn, you kinda look manly"" feeling, which I've read can actually increase your testosterone levels (the looking at yourself in the mirror with a beard part). I'll link up the study later.

Ask me anything you want!"
"Should I deload as a beginner? I mainly ask because I’ve worked up to 150 for 4 sets of 5 on bench and I haven’t been progressing past that. As a matter of fact it’s beginning to get really difficult, as in each session is more difficult than the last even though I’m doing the same amount of volume and weight.

I’m considering doing a deload next week and working up again but I’ve been told that “beginners shouldn’t deload”. I’ve been working out for about 7-8 months so I’m a beginner but not a complete beginner and I’ve also seen mostly linear progression until recently, so would a deload benefit me? 

Also I should add that all my workouts are feeling much more difficult lately despite not increasing the weight nor volume for the last few weeks or so. And before you say it yes I have looked at other factors, my diet has an adequate amount of protein and I’m in a caloric surplus, and I’m getting good enough sleep most nights (still working on that)."
"Tips on preventing Rotator Cuff injuries in bench? Hey guys, been progressing well on lifts, including bench, and I'm always very conscious of my form on bench to prevent RC injuries, yet sometimes post sets I still feel a little inflammation/warmth coming from the RC.  

&amp;#x200B;

My standard routine for bench is to warm up with shoulder swings, across the chest stretches, and then probably 10 reps of bench at 45, 5 reps at 95, 5 reps at 135, then whatever my rep/set-weight is.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm extremely conscious to squeeze my scapula together to be flat on the bench, and maintain that squeeze through the reps.  I use a grip that's fairly wide, about two fingers away from non-knurled ring, that allows for straight up and down forearm maintenance through the movement that hits my chest well.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I'll do a set of 3 175, feel a great pump in my chest, no pain in the RC, other times I'll do a set of 135 for 5 reps and find myself after slightly bothered by my RC.  

&amp;#x200B;

Tips on maintaining my RC health?  Will it improve as I continue to work on my bench?  Should I be concerned?  Any recommendations besides, 'go see someone and get an MRI' are much appreciated."
"Don’t let fear of fat get in the way of building muscle! That’s what cuts are for! I used to be scared about this but when I really started eating a good amount my strength has been going up exponentially. My arms are getting bigger, and booya! Sure, my stomach is gaining fat but I don’t care, that’s what bulking does to you. Unless you do a slow bulk which takes a lot longer to build muscle off of. At the beginning of 2020 I was 6’0 120 pounds, now I’m 6’0 167 pounds. Feels great knowing I have power to fight back if needed. I feel a lot healthier now, it’s nice. I take mass gainer after my workout(GNC serious mass) two scoops is 50 G protein and 1250 cals. I also take 5g of creating daily with orange juice, drinking it with water is absolutely disgusting and will make me gag."
"High School Athlete and Weightlifter - Transitioning Programs on a Bulk 
I am a 15M (5'11"", 155LBS) who has been lifting seriously for about 8 months now, (1 year and half beforehand without proper programming). I also play baseball for my High School JV Baseball Team. Currently I am running a PPL split 6 days a week which has worked well for me and I have enjoyed it. I would regard myself as pretty well educated on fitness overall, spending the last year focusing on understanding nutrition and strength training and am currently bulking so the energy levels are though the roof.

However, with the beginning of the official season in a few weeks and my coach requiring me to lower my training, I have to transition to a 5 day program. My question is what is your advice on programming for those playing a sport while trying to lift at the same time? (Especially at the peak years for muscle building).

I previously ran PHUL and now PPL. Looking into it, the two better options for me appeared to be Layne Norton's PHAT and 5/3/1 by Jim Wendler, but I was also wondering if you guys had any other suggestions, especially that allow for recovery."

Is this too much or is this pretty normal for this amount of calories?

I dont know if I should bulk becuase im scared of gaining too much fat Currently been going to the gym for 2 months and im starting to take creatine.

Finished my cut on 2000 cals/day and since then I have done:

2 weeks at 2400 (still lost weight) 

Now coming to the end of 2 weeks at 2700 and looks like I will gain around 1lb after the 2 weeks. 

But is this long enough to confirm I’m in a surplus? My brain is telling me no, if I lost weight at 2400 over 2 weeks then I’m not going to be gaining weight at 2700. 

Where I’m still a new lifter I think there’s an element of newbie muscle gain contributing to the ‘gain’ as well as the fact that my diet is a lot more carb heavy than it was when cutting. 

Would you do another 2 weeks at 2700 and then observe the results over 4 weeks? 

I’m REALLY wanting to dial in on my maintenance calories before I dive into ‘bulk mode’ as I want to make my bulk as lean as possible so it’s really important for me to not jump to the wrong conclusions. 

My training, including cardio volume, has been VERY consistent throughout this whole reverse diet phase. 

I’m using the average method of calculating my weight but my daily weight fluctuates so much that it can be hard to make sense even of the average over 1-2 weeks. 

For example my weight this week has ranged anywhere from 145.5lb to 149.7lb - so to use an average of the week to inform a decision about whether I’m in a net surplus/deficit seems a bit dangerous and easy to draw the wrong conclusions. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"Question about fucked up sleep habits I know it is recommended to have 7-8hours of sleep a night for good recovery and maximizing muscle growth. It's been a month since I've been spiralling into a vicious circle. I've been able to get the 7+ but they are interrupted hours. Meaning I keep waking up every 2 hours and it takes me 10 to 20 minutes to get back to sleep again. Does it make a difference for muscle growth? 

All I know is it does make a difference on my energy levels and feel nearly drained in the morning and I don't know how to fix it. Any tips?"
"Getting back into it After being very seriously into bodybuilding about 5 years ago and stopping due to life, I’ve decided to get back into it. 

Day one down, feels amazing! I can’t believe how much I missed the pump!

I perfected my diet and exercise system for my body type when I used to lift, but the question I have is now that I’m older (mid 30s), will my diet and exercise system still work the same? Or do I need to account for a potential lack of testosterone production."

"Still losing weight? Hey I'm 16 male and have currently 67kg and 185cm, I used to be very overweight with 167cm and 90kg and lost a lot of weight as well as built a lot of muscle. The thing is recently I'm focusing on gaining weight and tried following a diet 2800 to 3000 calories but last week I still lost 0,5kg, what am I doing wrong? Is it because I'm only using bodyweight to train instead of actual lifting? I'm scared to eat more than this since I'm afraid of regaining a lot of fat, since most bulks I see for people my weight are about this many calories. What should I do guys?"
"Getting too toned losing size Hey guys I'm M 33 6' 187 from 160. I feel like I am starting to lose some of my 'girth' in my arms for lack of a better term and getting more tone. I have very little fat in general so it's not like like I was skinny fat and losing that. 

This last week I did have to take it easy because I was having wrist problems. 

My intake is 295 carbs 75g fat protein 232g 2800 calories

I work out arms once a week and typically 4 excercises of tricep 3 sets 8-10 reps 
4 excercises of biceps 4 sets 8-10 reps. 

Question is should I lift heavier for lower reps or just eat more? Thank you for any advice!"
"Rep range for surfing performance Would a higher rep range (8-15) of a given exercise be more beneficial to increase my performance for 3 hour surfing sessions? Main muscles used in surfing are: back, shoulders, and triceps for padding and legs for riding the wave.

/u/mythicalstrength any thoughts on this?"
"What balance of consistency and variety works best to break/avoid plateaus? Relatively new to the gym(about 7 months), did my first 8 week PPL program from October-december in which most days I benched it was 5 sets of 12-15, some days 10-12. Since then been doing a 3x5 on bench twice a week and have plateaued. Asked some more experienced lifters and they said switch it up ,whether that be doing 5x5 for more volume or something like a 12-10-8-6 or some other higher rep slate like that, the goal being to keep your muscles guessing and not letting them get used to just doing the same thing each time. This makes sense to me, but then I am now wondering how much is too much or too little when it comes to switching it up? For example, would it be better to do:

Workout A: 5x5 for 3-4 weeks, then switch to a 12-10-8-6(or something similar) for 3-4 weeks

or

Workout B: Alternate 5x5 and 12-10-8-6(or something similar) every week.

\*If you can offer general advice on this topic that is more in more depth than just saying ""Workout A is better"" it would be greatly appreciated

Obviously workout B is more variety and would seemingly confuse your muscles more, but I'm sure there is some argument to keeping consistent for some amount of time before switching it up, and that is where I am now looking for any advice possible. I hit 195 on my 1 rep max towards the end of January and am wanting to hit 205 at the end of this month, but hadn't made much progress on my 3x5 since my last max and want to make sure I've actually gotten stronger since.

Thanks all!"
Is not eating in the morning ruining my potential gains? Hey. I wake up at 9am for work but always feel really nauseous and therefore the thought of eating anything is bad. I will usually have my first meal at 12. If I meet my calorie goal and protein goal by the end of the day does it matter that I skip breakfast and have my first meal 3 hours after waking up?

Is caffeine detrimental to weight gain? I drink caffiene everyday (70mg - 200mg) and since i'm short and skinny even a lower dose hits me hard. Does it hurt gains? I heard somewhere it makes you burn more calories. Is this true? if so i'm willing to quit completely
"More protein = More gains? Hey everyone. Just wanted to get your take on this. I’ve noticed some YouTube fitness people mention that they see better gains when taking 1.5 g of protein per pound of body weight as opposed to just 1 gram per pound of body weight. I’m currently taking only 1 gram per pound and I feel like my gains are minimal even though my nutrition and workout is solid. Wondering if upping my protein would help or if it’s just a waste of money. Anyone else experience better gains with more protein intake?

"One-pot breakfast prep - ideas / experience? Hey,

First off, have checked the FAQ info, but not sure it answers my question really...

I’m looking to improve my breakfast game. I currently eat 2 x eggs quickly scrambled, and a shake (oats, blueberries, yoghurt, banana, protein powder, peanut butter, water).

However, my breakfast appetite has been increasing over the years. Feel like I could be eating more at this time.

But we all know breakfast is early and annoying to do every day. So I want to make something that can last pretty much all week (or at least a few days). Get up early one morning and just do the prep. That I can make one big pot of (I have a big Le Creuset).

I saw Alan Thrall’s mountain man breakfast and it inspired me. I was thinking: sausages, potatoes, onions, peppers, and then lots of eggs all over the top. Maybe some cheese.

Any big one-pot breakfast recipes you know of? Anyone else do this? Do they last long in the fridge? Taste ok reheated? Etc.

Any info appreciated!!"
"Gym newbie asking for advice I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to be posting in for this but I'm a 23yo new gym goer weighing in at 85kg looking to lose my belly and love handles, and just get fit and tone my body in general. I'm quite in the dark regarding workouts, diets and all of that.   
I've been going to the gym for about three weeks now trying to aim at three to four one hour sessions throughout my week, I've been starting off with walking for two and a half minutes then jogging for another ten or so, then moving on to doing three reps of chest press, weighted situps, and general weight lifting (about 20 of each during a rep, more if I can do so), then heading back to the treadmill for another ten minutes of jogging. The majority of my meals are pasta or rice with vege's and mince or another kind of meat mixed throughout, I've eaten takeout once in the past two months, not a fan. I love canned sardines and tuna, things like beef jerky and pork crackle as snack foods. I've also cut down a lot on drinking and when I do I try to stick to low carb beers.  
Basically what I'm trying to ask is, am I doing this right? As someone who knows what they're doing what would you change about my diet and gym exercise?   
Thank you all in advance!"
"How should i split my upper-body routine? I posted this in r/fitness and no one responded, so hopefully I have better luck here. I work out at home. I've always just done a whole upper body workout, but i've seen a plateau in gains lately, especially in my chest. I'm adding dips to my workout since i don't have a bench. That puts me at 7 exercises though, so i've decided to split my upper body into ""chest/back"" and ""arm"" days. I do pull-ups, push-ups, dips, OHP, shoulder shrugs, bicep curls, and grip trainer. Since a lot of these are compound movements, how would you guys split them into the two categories?"
"How effective is Push Pull Legs as a 5 day split? I do a PPL split but I can only workout on weekdays so I’ll workout my 5 days then take two days off.

Can this hinder the rate of gains I can otherwise achieve? I read a lot about training frequency and hitting muscles twice a week and well, one group typically misses out each week (whichever lands on Wednesday) but I usually train it extra hard to make up for it.

Anyway, what do you guys think?"

I've already seen some progress (gained around 6 lbs so far) but I'm wanting to switch to the 5x5 plan for a multitude of reasons. Using the 5x5 workout plan that seems to be the most popular, ([Link](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/)) I'd be doing leg and upper body workouts on the same day. Is this better than doing leg/arm days? I've avoided this so far because of muscle soreness but this seems to get less and less every time I work out. This workout also doesn't incorporate chin-ups or dips (I really want to do a muscle up eventually). I've also heard good things about weighted lunges. Should I incorporate these exercises into the workout and if so what days would be best?"

Howdy fellas, wanted to update my progress from about 6 months ago, definitely been on and off of training and eating, but also DEFINITELY been gaining mass. 
Eating less sets me back more than training less I would say, find it funny that a cheat day for me is when I only have 2 meals all day, the way my appetite is naturally.

The before photo literally scares me when I look at it, tbf I was suffering from some health issues but regardless, IF YOU’RE SKINNY EAT BIG AND TRAIN BIG, you’ll love and thank your self later.
I hopped out of the shower and literally just had to admire my progress I’m so thankful for learning about intricacies of caloric intake and workout programs on this sub. 
I’m super lean rn in terms of fat, just holding some water weight due to creatine. I’d say I’m actually about 73.5kg

Right now my numbers are going up in the weight room, but I’m only pushing 2500 calories, so I’d def say lean bulking which is exhausting- I’m sleeping for 10 hours minimum but I feel great. I’m trying to move into more intermediate/ advanced programs as I’ve just been sticking to PPL routine, any suggestions are appreciated?!

My form is rubbish as to be expected from a beginner , it’s weird how I can always push my max for 2 reps. And moving up in weight I can’t push one rep... this is especially the case for deadlifts."
How to motivate yourself out of a bad day of eating? Following a clean bulk. How can I get out of the “screw it” mindset where I eat complete crap from cravings and continue to eat junk/sugary foods because I “broke my ‘diet’ already”?

"Sticking with a training program for too long? So I started training for the first time about 6 months ago. I’ve been following a 3 day week dumbbell program at home for those 6 months. Each week I either add reps or reset the reps and add weight. 

I’ve been seeing really good progress with this but I noticed yesterday that the program has an “8 week duration” and that most other programs also list either 8 or 12 week durations. Is there any problems with what I’ve been doing? Should I switch to a different program?"
"I need advice on continuing to force calories when I am on a medication that has a side effect of appetite suppression on top of me being a hardgainer. Edit: Don't know why I didn't think of it earlier, Focalin XR lasts 12 hours, eat a big meal before 8 am and after 8 pm. And switch up the food as well.

I am somewhere between an ecto and mesomorph build wise, I am 145 (used to be 135) [trying to reach 150] pounds and I am 5' 10.5"" I have a fast metabolism and I'd force oatmeal shakes and make sure at least half the stuff I eat is healthy, I do light full body strength in the morning every day for  around 30 minutes. I used to and love running a lot and I'd force eat more depending on how much I ran, it seems it would be impossible to do on top of being a hard gained on appetite suppression medication. 

I heard Eddie Hall or Brian Shaw I forgot, but one of them said while they are eating they have to hype themselves up and listen to music to eat, because they have to eat so much to maintain their weights.

Edit: I am asking for advice on what fellow hardgainers or appetite suppressed people do it gain weight, so I can have a few more ideas. I gave traits about myself that everyone is trying to debunk or prove wrong rather than help the main issue, I said between ecto and meso morph because most of my traits are of both. I am not directly saying ecto is a bad thing or making a big excuse to stop trying to eat. I like running so I like the skinnier build, but my jobs demand more. I can handle them now, but I want them to become easier and not wear down joints as bad. So I wanted to put on 15-25 pounds.

I am aware we are technically a mix of all 3 but them 2 are more prominent for me. If you only think you can be one morph, than you must share most traits with 1 morph and barely the other 2 I'd assume. I have sharp shoulders, bigger thighs, defined stomach, but the low default weight and difficulty to gain makes me part ecto too. My dad I'd consider a close to pure meso and he can drop or gain 20-30 pounds with minimal effort."

Should I just skip dumbbell exercises and replace it with others? Hey guys I’m 5’8 120lb M 18 doing ppl and calorie surplus.

"The Netflix show, Alone, has really changed my perspective when it comes to food If you don't know the premise of the show, it's a survival contest near the Arctic Circle in Canada. 10 contestants are placed hundreds of miles away from one another and the last one to not give up wins. The competitors do not know how many others are left and can be removed from the competition if they lose too much weight. 

It's evident right away that every contestant on the show thinks about one equation. Calories in versus calories out. Some will stay in their sleeping bags all day to conserve energy if they do not eat enough food. You get to see right away that our bodies are machines, that if not taken care of can really break down. They hold fat from animals in the highest regard on that show and having some extra body fat at the start really saves you in the long run. 

Want to keep this post short but it's a great show when seeing hunger at its most primal level! If you struggle with the idea of eating or have some inklings of body dysmorphia this show may really help. It changed how I view food as fuel. Before long shifts at work, I definitely will use all my time to prepare my body.

"Eating calories surplus with a weak stomach Hi guys,

I am just wondering if anyone here has has issues with general stomach issues related to eating. For me, this is general discomfort and mild nasuea when I eat, sometimes with a little acid reflux on the side.

I know there are some types of foods that are tougher on the stomach, and I have done some research on things that should be avoided. The difficulty here is a lot of those things are high calorie/fat foods that are good for bulking. I have also heard that spreading eating across smaller meals throughout the day can help, but I think it is fair to say that for most people this is difficult to do with a regular work/life schedule. I don't have a crippling problem, I don't vomit after eating or wake up vomiting from heartburn. Its just bothersome enough that I have difficulty eating 3000+ calories in a day.

I have a good feeling most people here will suggest talking to my doctor about it, but I am just looking for some insight from anyone with similar experiences.

I should note that I am currently 6'2"" 163lbs or so. My max was around 185lbs, and during this time I was eating a lot, but it was still a struggle as I was often eating til I felt sick. With this pandemic I haven't been working out or eating as much and I have just recently begun making an effort to gain back some weight. But I'm noticing it is even more difficult than ever to eat a lot. I can feel like i'm not very ""full"" per se, but can't bring myself to eat anymore because I feel so bloated. Like I know there's room in there but my body is telling me it's not worth it.

I guess I'm just taking a shot in the dark here and wondering if someone in a similar situation was able to do something simple to allow them to either eat more or supplement macros in another way.

Tldr: I feel bloated when eating. Makes eating calorie surplus especially difficult. Suggestions welcome."

"Is my new idea for workout intervals CRAZY? Would I be wasting my time?  

I work from home from 8-5pm and gotta get OUT of this chair more!! I'm in shape but in a huge rut for 3 months.

Here's my idea:

Start an interval timer right at 8am that will **loop all day**:

* **15 minutes**: Work (day job) for 15 straight minutes without interruption \*BEEP\*
* **1 minute**: Get up and Lift/Exercise  

   * Using dumbbells right behind my chair.
   * Can be any exercise as long as I'm hustling the entire minute. Will likely alternate between either a) same exercise all day or b) alternate muscle groups every cycle
   * Lifting for 1 minute is about 8-12 reps
* **4 minutes**: Remaining 4 minutes for break/bathroom/leisure

Then loop. So I would get 3 hard minutes of exercise every 60 minutes.

**8 hour work day = 24 minutes of exercise.**

Is this genius or stupid? (lol)

or is it simply ""anything that gets you out of the chair is good"" the appropriate answer?"

"GZCL for Basketball Greetings my fellow Gainers.  After 2 months of setting aside weight training (lifting around 2x per week) to focus on basketball season, I feel it’s time to get back to gaining.  I was thinking of running a GZCL-based plan, but I was wondering if anyone on here has run the program and had any advice or has learned something just through experience.  My primary focus is to get stronger, and although hypertrophy is certainly welcome, my main reason for lifting is to be able to take contact at the rim and just increase strength in general.  If anyone has ever run GZCL, please let me know how it went and what the results looked like.  Thanks."
"[Progress] 150 -&gt; 195 1 year 3 months(ish) Pics:  https://imgur.com/gallery/HlbB3zj   First is at 155-160, second at 195. (Wake up, post piss)

Timeline: Get to school freshman year (150), bulk until sent home because of the covid second semester (185). I didn't work out or eat over the summer so started school sophomore year (170), bulk to thanksgiving (195), back to school after winter break (180) then to now (190). 

I didn't work out pretty much at all the entire summer of 2020. Gains are from basically 10 months in the gym spread out over a bit over a year. 

Lifts: 

Bench- 265

Squat- 315

Deadlift- 425

Overhead press- 145

&amp;#x200B;

Diet: Lots of pop tarts, peanut butter, cake, etc on top of the daily eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and tendies. 

Routine: Legs, back, chest. Don't really hit shoulders that much. Core mixed into leg day (sometimes). 1 day off a week. 

Going forward: up the intensity on leg day. For sure feel that I can put a few more pounds on my legs pretty easily to pick me up to 200. If I can clean up my diet but then again pop tarts taste good so probably not. Mixing in some cardio will also be nice but I like doing that from sports which are currently shut down. I May go back into rowing if I can get on the water but that won't be for a month or two. Current lifting goals are 5 plate deadlift, 4 plate squat, 3 plate bench press. Hopefully by end of summer.

But the most important thing I learnt was that I can gain weight as per my will. It's not impossible as I earlier thought it to be. I am still a long way from my goal, but I know I can achieve it if I stick to my diet.

Thank you r/gainit! Your posts have made me feel so much better about myself."
"Weight regression on deadlifts while gaining weight The past two deadlift sessions I've had the weight seems to feel extremely heavy, even in sets that would have been warm ups. It's gone from 245 x 5 RPE 9 to 205 x 5 RPE 9.5. Which basically put me to where I was a few months ago. When I look at my form it doesn't look bad either, and I'm following Alan thralls deadlift setup. When I look for an answer online it seems to always say my back is rounding, but from what I've seen it doesn't look like it. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Or have any tips to help me?"

"5/3/1 - Recommended weight vs usual lift Hello all,

I'm currently on 5/3/1, and I did one day so far. I have DL and OHP today.

I was curious about the % of TMax it has you do. For the % it has to start at 40%. I cut that out, because that's barely a warmup. 

It gets as high as 85% TMax for 1xAMRAP with a minimum of 5. For squats, that was tough, but I banged out 7. I think Squats, it worked well, absolutely killed me. 

For Bench, it was almost too easy. Sure, I felt the burn, but banging them out was way too easy. For the 85% AMRAP, I did 11. Should I increase my TMAX or retest my 1RM? I thought it was accurate, but maybe it's not. 

We'll see how DL goes today. My max DL is 425, and I've been doing 3x5 of 365lb. Switching to this, I'm worried it'll be too easy, and at the EOM when I HOPE to have added 25lb to my lifts, I'm worried, it won't have increased as much as it could.

So, my question is:

Should I increase my TMax or %'s, or will 5/3/1 in this fashion, following the plan, actually increase my 1RM, because if I had to guess going by my bench, I'd say no.

Thanks all!"
"Under daily calorie intake and still gaining fat more than muscles! I have been lifting weight for a little more than 5 months now after taking a break for two years due to a lower back injury. Thanks to ego lifting.

I used a calorie measurement tool according to which I should eat 2500 calories per day. I have been following this diet which I have shared below. However, my daily average is around 2200 calories.

[https://imgur.com/a/zJb9Djn](https://imgur.com/a/zJb9Djn)

I am Indian male, 5'7"" weighing 73Kgs currently. My current body fat percentage is around 23.8%. Age is 27.

When I started 5 months ago my weight was around 67Kgs, with a body fat percentage of 19%. My tummy has also increased by 4 inches in such a short time. I believe I am gaining more fat than muscles. I had to stop so I don't gain any further weight and belly.

I don't want to go on a bulk diet and then go for a cut. I will be happy if my muscles build slowly over time. I am not aiming for a bodybuilder look. Just want to look lean.

I have used three methods to arrive at the average fat percentage: Fat caliper, navy method, and Mi Body Weight scale which has a fat% measuring tool. My fat percentage is the average of the three reading given above.

Do I need to tweak my diet? What's wrong with it?"
"Death by Pullups: A cure for small lats Hey folks, what with gyms being sporadically shut down every few months because of the pandemic, I'm sure a lot of you have a fairly solid plan b at home to keep the gain train rolling during lockdowns.

I'm no exception. I developed a workout, named ""death by pullups"" that I like to do on one of my pull days during the week. It added notable width to my lats in 10 weeks and I got way stronger at hauling my body vertically through space.

A few caveats to this: 

×I recommend warming your shoulders up extremely thoroughly prior to each time you do this. Scap depressions on a pull up bar, band pullaparts, low intensity band assisted pullups. Whatever you need to do.

×Run this progression linearly for maybe 8 weeks, then take a break. Do something else for your back work for a month. Then go back to it if you like. This can be stressful on the forearms and could lead to tendonitis of you do it for too long. I don't have a multi grip pull up bar at present, I suspect that if one did you could run the workout progression for longer.

*I do not recommend running this if you aren't already quite good at pullups. This is meant as a method to add goals for the intermediate ""puller"" to progress size and strength in a short period of time. Good form is of course a pre requisite, be honest with how you count reps. 

*The volume below may seem daunting. Trust me, if I can do it with very average genetics, you can too . Just remember to work hard and get that one more rep. As the plan dictates that you start with high weight and move down as the reps increase, the CNS is so fired up that the lighter weights seem so much easier even when the muscles are fatigued. 

×I don't recommend doing much else in the gym on the day you run this. Your lats are shattered, your grip is cooked, your bis are sautéed. 

Test your all out max bodyweight pullups /chinups before your run this. Then again after. I'd be shocked if you honestly don't add 10-12 reps. 


The programme is as follows:

5 rep sets:
-Start off with your weaker grip (overhand/underhand). 
-Pick a weight where the first set is an RPE 8ish
-Try your best to get 5 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, rinse and repeat. 
-If you get all 50 reps, add a small amount of weight next week. 

8 rep sets:
-Go back to your weak grip. 
-Pick a weight where you can get 8 reps, again RPE 8.
-Do 4 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, do 4 sets. 
-if all sets are completed, add a rep to as many sets as you can next time (only increase weight on these sets once you can do sets across with 10 reps). 

Bodyweight:
-You're beginning to see a pattern? 
- 3 sets, 12 reps on weak grip. 
-Rinse, repeat, strong grip. 

Band assisted 
-1 burnout set with your weak grip. 
-1 burnout set with your strong grip. 

You're done. Leave the gym. 

It's simple, it's hard, it's not terribly fun but it gets results. I went from bodyweight+25kg for 5 rep max sets on chinups to adding 37.5kg. Bodyweight chins went from 17 reps to 33."
"Need some advice, kinda noob Aight so ive been lifting for about 5 months, went from 58kg to about 67. Am 15.5% bf, bulking until 17% before cutting as my previous bulk was until 18% so i see no harm in going to 17%. Am about 1.8m tall.

For the compound exercises the weight displayed is per side so x2 and add 20kg for the bar

My routine rn is this :

●Mon/thurs: 

•Bench press (mon)

7x 17.5

8x 15

9 x 12.5 

•Behind neck Shoulder press

7x 7.5

8x 6.25

9x 5 

•Incline bench press (thurs)

8x 10kg

9x 8.75

10x 7.5 

•Tricep extension
3 2x8 


●Tues/fri: 

•Chin ups (tues)
3x5 +2 

•Deadlift: (fri)
5x 35 

•Face pulls : 10 3x10 

•Bicep curl
3x11 3.75kg 

•Lateral raises 
1.75 3x9


●Wed/sat: 

•Squat 

8x 28.75

9x 25

10x 22.5 

•Romanian Deadlift 
3x8 21.25 

•Calf raises
3x8 17.5 kg 

•Neck 2x8 6.75kg

The idea was to add +1 rep per set until i hit 8 reps for my first set, then increase the weight and do a amrap, but i just realised that going up  a weight puts my reps to like 4 for the first set, not sure if too low. Also my bench has been stuck at 7 reps for two weeks.

Is my programme good? Or is there some muscles im neglecting. Recovery has been ok but progress is slow, not exactly going up super fast.
Also is 2kg a month to slow for a hypertrophy programme? Not muscle just weight."
"PT to show me some free-weight compound lifts? Hey,

Been messing around I’m the gym for about a year (3 x 30min sessions a week, machines / cables) and have actually seen nice progress with my body.

However, feel i could genuinely look about 3 times better if I took it more seriously e.g. 4 hours a week and did proper compound lifts with free-weights.

But, I’m not going to lie, the free-weight section intimidates me a bit. I was thinking I could ask a PT to do a few sessions with me to ‘ease me in’. But wouldn’t want to (read: can’t afford) to continue. Would they do this? And even worth it in your opinion? Could help psychologically, but also in terms of doing the actual exercises properly. Or should I just stop being a p__sy?

Bonus question: any super simple compound lift guide? I’ve heard of the 5x5. I want to focus on (mainly) upper body. Would this work?

Thanks in advance!"
"Can I still eat bad and gain muscle? Okay some backstory, I’m 17 and 6’7” 180lbs. I have so far gained ~20lbs from working out and eating more. I don’t eat like shit all the time. Every morning I eat greek yogurt with a bit of raw honey, a banana, and natural granola. After that though, depending if I’m working or not, I’ll eat chick fil lay or snack on something at home (which is usually the case since I’m broke and I try to control myself). I don’t eat out super often but I do go a decent amount. Especially after moving into a new house with more kids (my dad got married), they like to eat out a lot. They made me get Chinese takeout but I didn’t even order any because I ate out the last few days lol. I just had a peanut butter and banana sandwich with some fig bars for dinner instead. 

While I do eat shitty and snack a lot on chips and stuff, I also make sure to take vitamins and eat fruits as well, or something that is packed with protein / nutrients instead of garbage all the time. 

Should I just cut out all of the bad food and stick to all healthy stuff? I love ice cream and chips, sometimes candy. I haven’t drank soda in 6 years though."
"Bulking too hard I know fat is easier to lose than muscle is to gain, but somehow I’ve bulked past my abs in a week by implementing a 250 calorie surplus daily. Either my TDEE is wildly off or I just gain fat super easy. So, my question is if I should mini cut or not to reset and then try to gain again? Or should i just reduce my calories but continue to gain.  Currently running the Alpha Destiny novice program. Height 6’5” weight: 155"
"Have you guys been successful in lockdown? Have any of you managed to make some good gains at home from limited/ no equipment? Would be interesting to hear what methods you did to achieve this and what equipment you invested in. My equipment consists of a pull up bar, dipping belt, 12.5kg dumbbells, rings and bands. Really enjoy training with a mix of callisthenics and weights. Unfortunately legs are a bit harder to train without a bar to add weight to."
"hitting arms with fairly high volume EOD, too much? Hi! I've got a question... 

My current routine is chest+back/rest/arms+legs+shoulders/rest/repeat. 

Do higher volume and I like to do one drop set per muscle group at the end of every workout, I like the pump and the burn and the control with the lower weight at the end..... 

 My chest and back day consists of 4 compound movements each, 4x pushing 4xpulling. At the last exercise of chest and back I strip the weight off and do drop sets. So the volume and the stress on the muscle is fairly high. Then 48 hours later when I train arms, I have two exercises for bicep and two for tricep, on the second exercise, again, I do drop sets. 

That means arms are getting hit with pretty high volume every other day. 

I like that routine, but sometimes I think if I would just do push/pull, each arm muscle would have 4 days of rest, vs 48 hours, getting hit directly and indirectly all the time. 

My arms aren't that great by the way. Do you think I should switch to push pull at a frequency of every other day?"
"Protein powder safety I do not know where to post this, so I am posting it here since this is the closest sub to this topic.

I have been taking protein powder as a suplement, 25-75g/day. I have 78kg and I think this is an ok dosage when it comes to protein powder on its own, excluding proteins from food.

Few days ago my mom told me to stop doing that since in her hospital there was a 4th case of hepatomegaly, for which the doctors assume it is because of protein (from protein powder) precipitation in liver, since ""liver can't take that much of protein"".

Now, I am a pharmacist and this makes no sense to me because there can be multiple reasons why those men (they were all 18-22 years old and working out) had hepatomegaly, and not solely because of protein intake. Even in that case, why did they not assume it was because they took too much of it in the first place?

There are so many safety studies when it comes to protwin powder and many people take this supplement without having such terrible side effect, yet the doctors think it is because of the protein...

Every comment would be welcome."

"Lifting Party for u/mythicalstrength's ""6 Months of Eating and Training For Mass"" Hello lifters.

I'm coming off a cut and will be getting back into the gym for the first time in damn near a year.

"Best adjustable dumbells for quarantine/lockdown? Hey!

Since quarantine/lockdown keeps getting extended I'm finally deciding on getting some adjustable dumbells for bulking up! I currently have a bench with a 7kg barbell and some light plates, but it's all outside in my open garage and we've just had our first snowy weather come through. This has resulted in the weather being below at least -1 degrees Celcius which is simply too cold for me to even bother working out. The stuff is also some old rusty stuff from my dad's past job that we picked up.

I'm severely underweight, (18 years old, 183cm/46kg), and I don't have space for a squat rack inside our home. Therefore I thought, that a pair of adjustable dumbells would be good enough for a 6-day ppl routine while staying at home. Is that true?

I live in Denmark/Europe and I'm willing to pay whatever price for them as long as they are the best I can get. I don't care about the cost as long as they are able to get me from my current weight and up +10kg at least if lockdown keeps going for long enough! I've already trained 1 year before but an eating disorder hit me and I lost from 64kg (March 2020, lockdown start) to my current weight of 46kg (This date).

I also have a bench that is kinda old, but it goes from decline to 90 degrees with a removable lock mechanism.

TLDR: Best adjustable dumbells on the market for whatever price? (Not crazy expensive like 2000$+ diamond dumbells, but you all know what I mean, Ahah xD)"

When I started lifting I was about 75kg. For some reason, I have it in my head that I want to be 100kg, so I've used lockdown as an opportunity to try and smash through my plateau. I've been eating 200g of protein per day, pretty intense volume training, taking creatine and doing no cardio (I usually cycle 12 miles to work), and while my strength has improved in all areas and my muscles look 'bigger' and more defined, my weight has stayed exactly the same.

"25M, 6', 130 lbs. Looking to bulk. Which calorie calculator is most accurate? How much to eat? Hi all, I'm looking to start bulking from next week when I turn to the gym. I'm having a hard time deciding what calories to start with. Most online calculators give wildly different answers. I'm going to be following the 6 day a week PPL routine. I've sort of averaged the numbers from calculators to conclude I'll need to start with 2300 cals a day. This is using 10 percent over maintenance. Any folks here have any suggestions on whether this sounds like a reasonable number for such a plan? Or recs on which calculator to follow. I realise they're all estimates but they vary so much, it's confusing. For example, the TDEE calculator suggests  I take over 2700.

I've bulked in the past but I wasn't careful and always gained ridiculously amounts of fat instead of muscle gains or strength so I'm looking to take it really careful this time after having trimmed down hard.

"Callus peeling off when I deadlift Hello, I have about 1 year total time under my belt for weightlifting. I started to work out in May 2018 at 5'11"", 145lbs, and finished in Decemeber 2018 at 6'0"" 165lbs. Lifts went from:

bench: 75 for reps to 135 for reps

deadlift: 100 for reps to 245 for reps

squat: 85 for reps to 200 for reps

I've worked out on and off for months at a time (I'm in college now so finding time was tricky), but this year I've been serious about going and have been for the last month+. Started 2021 at 170 and am up to 175 now.

One issue I've ran into throughout my journey is my grip strength feels really weak. My 1rp in Dec 2018 was 300lbs, but my callus peeled off during this rep and it hurt a lot, even though I felt like I could have lifted 315 at least. Yesterday I was deadlifting 255 x 5 and my callus started to peel off again, so I had to stop. I feel like my grip is the limiting factor, because my the hardest part about standing up during the lift is not the standing its making sure the bar doesn't fall out.

Are straps a good idea? I feel like I'm still at a relatively low weighted deadlift for them and don't want to become dependent on them. I don't use a belt either for that reason. Any tips would be appreciated, thanks."
"27, 6'3"" and 182 lbs. Been spending quarantine time reassessing my gym goals and figuring out my game plan when gyms reopen and I need your input please! Hey /r/gainit. Longtime member here just looking for some input. Currently [I look like this,](https://imgur.com/a/qFk50lL) and [I want to look like this.](https://imgur.com/a/2uA5igI), or [like this.](https://preview.redd.it/malhxsn0mxp51.jpg?width=950&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=827f7109fd7adb79c630c8cef11dc21c5bf2d043) What can I do to get there (besides tanning lol)? Currently i’m 6’3” at ~182 lbs. Not sure on my bodyfat %. 

With quarantine round 2 happening its given me time to reassess where i’m at and I figure it’s a good time to plot my plan for when gyms reopen to stop fucking around since this time off from the gym has made me reflect on my gainit goals and given me all the motivation to grind hard for it when they reopen.

I’ve just been spending quarantine eating at a maintenance calorie wise with high protein to try and preserve the bit of muscle I have built over the years while doing some resistance band stuff. But when I can get back into my gym and have access to actual decent gym equipment (which should be soon), i’d love some advice on any routines you can recommend and any other advice for gaining hypertrophy. 

My focus for the next year at least is to try and put on some serious size and I definitely am focused on hypertrophy since my goal is primarily (and pretty much exclusively) aesthetics. Prior to this most recent lockdown in my area I had 4 months of gym time and I was doing a 4 day split made for me by an online trainer and I was making some decent progress on that. Just trying to debate whether I continue on that once my gym reopens or if I should switch to a program that any of you with similar goals to me have had great success with. 

I find I tend to get a bit of analysis paralysis when it comes to routines and customizing them to my goals or areas where i'm lacking so I could definitely use some advice there. Also, how long should someone stay on a specific routine for? Sometimes I see people say no longer than 12 weeks, othertimes it's when you stop progressing. See, there's my analysis paralysis again lol. Am I overthinking things? A common piece of advice I see is ""the best routine is one you can stick to"" but then on the other hand I see info about how you shouldn't stick to a specific routine for too long. So, i'm a bit confused.

Any advice you guys can share would be awesome I seriously do need it. Thanks guys!"

"How do you guys deal with mental aspect of gaining weight? I'm a formerly overweight 15YO who has been lifting for about 2 years but only really training seriously for about 8 months.

Because I was overweight, I have no problem eating the food I need for training and sports, eating about 3750 currently with 2 a days weight training and baseball. However, I still am constantly faced with having to get over the mental back of seeing that scale go up each day. I know that I am bound to gain some fat but am still worried that I am gaining too much or too fast and not optimizing muscle gain. So I was wondering how do you guys deal with maybe weigh issues or body issues while bulking?"

"Not Recovering: Is my workout volume too high or are my calories too low? Hi,

So, I've been bulking since the start of the year and I've gone from 152 lbs to 156 lbs over the past month. Over the past week my lifts haven't been going up. Rather than feeling fresh, I feel tired and sore when going into a workout.

Currently, I am eating between 2600-2800 cals a day. I am 25 years old, 156 lb and 6'2. At 152 lbs I was 7.1 % bf, but I don't know about now. I eat over 200 grams of protein a day.

I've been gaining on my current calories, just because I only get any exercise when I go to the gym. Otherwise, I am sitting down from the moment I wake-up.

My workout routine is a modified version of the 6-day reddit PPL.

**Push day (A/B):**

4x5-8 Bench press/OHP

3x8-12 OHP/BP

3x8-12 Incline

3x8-12 DB press

3x8 Skullcrushers ss w/ lat raises

3x8-12 tricep extension machine ss w/ lat raises

**Pull Day:**

3x8-12 Pullups 

4x5-10 Pendlay row 

3x8-12 Wide pulldowns

3x8-12 Chest supported row

4x8-12 Face Pulls ss w/ barbell curls

4x8-12 DB preacher curls

**Leg day:**

70 Bw squats

4x8-12 BB Squats

4x8-12 Stiff legged Deadlifts

3x8-12 burpees as high as possible

&amp;#x200B;

Every other day I hit abs, with 3xmax leg raises followed by 4x8-12 cable crunches.

Right now I can do bench for 125x7, squats for 135x12, deadlifts for 205x12

**Is that too much volume, or are my calories just too low? I am confused, because I've been gaining weight and I can see a physical difference, but my lifts have not been progressing. My cals seem rather low, when I compare my calories to other's bulking cals.**

I'd prefer to keep up with the volume, because I really look forward to going to the gym. The only thing that is sucky is that I am not progressing in the weights I've been doing, and I am sore before starting a workout.

Do you guys think I should make some changes, or keep chugging as is and hope my body's ability to recover catches up?"
"I got my routine down. Can somebody look over it and maybe tell me if there are some major mistakes? First of all i would like to thank everyone thats gonna read this. Its a huge help for me and i dont take it for granted in the slightest.  I will list my shit, and at the bottom i will write a couple of questions. Also i tried to format it nice, so u can read it better. I hope this helps.

Okay so im **6'5""** and i started to really eat way more like 3 months ago. Since then ive gained like 10 pounds, so now im at **175lbs**. I believe these are called noob gains tho. 


**My diet:**


My Tdee should be somewhere around 3000 and i pretty much eat somewhere around 4000kcal every single day.

These consists of:

600 oat cereals


700 pbj


600 for a snack (burritos, walnuts, or egg sandwiches)


700 for dinner (most of the time i eat rice or pasta with some extra shit like beans or turkey and some vegetables)


1200 shake with oats, banana, ice cream, milk, chia seeds and olive oil



I think this is considered a dirty bulk. 



**My workout:**

Its kinda scuffed i think. Due to lockdown i train at home, but i train 6 days of the week. I am doing low intensity and high rep workouts, as i only have 2 dumbbells, each with 22pounds. My routine is to start Monday with workout A, then B, then A, then B, then A, then B, then rest.





**Workout A:**

4x 25 pushups


4x 15 bicep curls


4x 15 dumbbell benchpress on the ground (22lbs each)


4x 6 shoulder dumbbell shoulder raises (22lbs each)


4x 15 dumbbell rows (22lbs each)


4x 15 weighted bench dips (44lbs on thighs)


**Workout B:**

4x 15 weighted squads (22lbs on each shoulder)


4x 15 sumo deadlifts (44lbs)


4x 15 romanian deadlifts (44lbs)


4x 15 (per leg) weighted bulgarian split squads, (22lbs)


4x 15 lying hamstring curls (22lbs)



On all days im doing 3 kinds of planks 3 times for 30 seconds






**So my questions are:**

1. how good is my diet, and do i have to eat more after gaining some weight?
2. how is my workout, and how far will low weights get me?
3. is gaining around 15pounds in the next 6 months a realistic goal?

**Thank you so much, i appreciate every answer.**"
"I'm trying to gain some muscle mass quick, but I also have to do a shit ton of cardio for my kickboxing classes. Would it be healthy to start consuming corn starch shakes for extra carbs? It's just that I'm losing weight extremely fast even though I lift 3 hours every day, including leg day, I'm eating 5 eggs a day, protein shakes after my workouts, lots of bread, vitamins, multiple snacks, nuts, milk, large lunches and dinner and I just don't know what to do. I think corn starch might be a good option for carbs but I don't know if it's going to be healthy."
"7 month bulk progress - 30lbs of gaining, one month to go Hey all, 

Been lifting hard for 7 months since July 1st. June of '19 to July of '20 was basically just cutting and running to lose weight. 

Dropped to 189lb, and was ready to physically start packing on muscle. So I ate at 500cal surplus, dropped to a 250kcal surplus, then went back, when I realized that ""hey... I need to eat more food"".

At a 3,250kcal intake right now. Usually get slighty above that, just make sure to never be below it. 

Strength gains definitely saw an increase after the increase food. 

My 1RMs are currently:

Bench: 215lb - Definitely my weakest lift. I have a training weight of 160lb for 4x8. I could definitely be doing better, but it's my first year lifting so whatever. 

Squat: 280lb - This is just a guess, since my training weight is 245lb for 5x5. I don't generally lift for strength, just hypertrophy. This and DL are there to make me stronger. I'm scared to try a 1RM for squat. Which is silly, because I have my safety rails right there.

EDIT: 1RMed the other day at 335. Super happy.

Dead Lift: 425lb - This, while not as amazing as it could be, is my strongest lift. I definitely had more progress on DL than anything else, and I love doing it. Currently, my training weight is 365lb for 3x5, and my 425lb was a very wobbly lift, but I got it up. Started using a belt recently. Made a huge difference.

https://imgur.com/gallery/snSw2lM

Overall, I'm really happy with my progress. Definitely some fat gain, as to be expected, but definitely some muscle gain, as well. Can't wait to finish this month and get back to cutting. Lifting hard for 8 months is hard AF"
Should I take creatine during wrestling season?(creatine is legal in high school athletics) I just recently started creatine and I know that you are supposed to be drinking a lot of water while taking it.  Im currently bulking but I am also a wrestler and in March our season will start.  I will not be lifting during the season so should I still take creatine?  Will it help me while I wrestle? Also I know that just because of the nature of wrestling and cutting weight for it that there will be times that I am dehydrated. Will this be dangerous for me if I continue to take creatine?  Thank you for your time.
"Is there any downside to gaining weight to fast except gaining too much fat (which I don't care about) So I started tracking my calories with the App Lifesum where you can also set your goal. I (203cm/6'8"" | 80kg/176lb) set my goal to 95kg and the app told me how much I should eat for that to be at 95kg in 28 weeks. I exercise the whole body every other day but I'm also eating about 3500-4000 kcal every day, often more than the app tells me to. 

That's why I'm currently gaining weight at a very high rate I started about 3 weeks ago and now I mostly see 83/84kg on the scale. Are there any health concerns for gaining this fast? My meal plan consists mostly of brown bread with peanut butter, oats, eggs, noodles and whatever is for lunch (usually healthy). So I would say I'm not eating unhealthy but are there any other factors I should consider?"
"My 14 YO son started lifting - now he wants to solve every challenge with supplements. We as parents are a bit worried - should we be? &amp;#x200B;

As the title says my 14YO started lifting in our home gym recently. We are all for it, it's great.

However I'm a bit concerned with his repeated requests for different supplements. First it started with protein powder which we had no problem with, then witamins, fish oil - which was fine as well. EDIT - the supplements I mentioned above I'm totally fine with. Those below worry me a bit. 

However now he's asking for creatine and caffeine because he 'needs energy when doing his morning workout'. For the time being we said no to that. He claims that he's done all the research, however I wanted a second opinion.

On top of that there's a niggling thought in the back of my mind saying: 'he's trying to solve every problem he has with a supplement'.

Are we just being overprotective or is this a legit concern.

**Edit: Thank you all for the replies. They were really informative. I let my son read this thread. We'll have a chat about it tomorrow.**"
"Lats taking over Facepulls Been training from 3 months. Initially, I loved facepulls, I felt my rear delts getting toasted and I loved it, it also helped me with my posture and rear delt gains.

But it's been a month, I don't know what happened but I don't feel my delts any more. I feel like my upper lats are doing most of the work. What could I be doing wrong?

P.S. I started pull ups a month ago as well. Could there be any relation?"
"Upper Chest How important is upper chest work for a big and full chest? I haven’t done incline work before, should I shift to incline bench and press exclusively?"
"Hit 975lb on main three lifts. Need that extra 25lb and only a month to do it... Add extra 500kcal? Hey all

I recently maxed my deadlift at 425lb and my bench at 215lb. 

Today, I hit 335lb for squat. That puts me only 25lb away from joining the 1000lb club at my gym. Pretty good for 7 months of lifting.


Until today, I have been primary lifting for hypertrophy. However, I have one month left until I start my cut. 8 months of bulking is enough for now.

I would like to hit that extra 25lb between now and the end of the month, which means focusing my lifts and eating on strength gains. 

First, is it possible to add that last 25lb in one month? Second, on top of a three day strength program, should I add another 500kcal to my daily diet?

I'm at a surplus of 500kcal right now and eating 3,250 ATM. This would put me at 3750. 

Do you think I can get there if I add that extra food? 

Thanks all!"
"Low Glycemic Index Foods to Bulk With? Non-lethargic Gainers, etc Hey folks (last post got removed since I was posting on my throwaway. Here's my main acct).

PERSONAL INFO:

\[Been gaining for about 4 months. Canadian. 21 y/o Male. Started in November 2020 at 132 lbs/6'2"", minimal exercise. Started by going for about 2500 cals per day, plus daily bicep curls with bags of flour (essentially 40lb barbell curls), pushups and situps. Currently in January 2020 I'm at 145 lbs, getting about 2800 cals per day. I invested in a 22.5 lb dumbell and a door chinup bar which are sweet as fuck. Nowadays, my workouts are sporadically made up of 70-rep sets of pushups (diamond/full form/reduced progressively), chinups, wide-grip pullups, self-weighted chest presses, etc. Happy with my workout routine, nothing to complain about there.\]

Okay, now to the main question/issue:

I've been trying to find ways to consume more of my calorie carb split (I do 35 prot 35 fat 30 carb) as complex/low GI carbs, since I find that the simple stuff (maltodextrin-heavy mass gainer shakes) makes me really lethargic when I consume it in high doses (plus I'm prone to prediabetes so I wanna avoid that y'know). Issue is, all the complex carbs I try to consume in the same amount as the simple ones are just so fucking tiring to eat. Like a solid hour of eating oats, or lentils, or brown rice, like jesus christ it's so slow. I think the fibre just makes it so time consuming to eat, and yeah it might be more healthy but fuck. Also it fills me up which makes eating more hard since I have GERD/acid reflux. lol.

Also, I don't wanna be eating like 400% of my daily fibre and having rock solid shits every few hours.

Anyone gotten around this issue? Any complex/low GI carbs you bulk with that you can eat lots of without having a sore jaw or feeling as lethargic? Any tips would be fantastic folks thanks a ton folkies."
"Anyone had experience with doing ""myoreps"" for hypertrophy? TLDW: Do a weight that's tough for 10reps, take 5-10 seconds rest, then do 5more and repeat to 25.

So it's one set 10reps then 3sets 5 reps. All with the very short rest. This is best done with machines or isolation work rather than something like a squat.

John Meadows shared a [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iZli2Azc68) not too long ago regarding this training style. He argues that because growth is initiated from reps close to failure, doing 10/25 sets or ""myoreps"" will allow a good majority of the reps done to contribute to muscle growth. Are these ideas legit? Do they have any basis with your results or literature?"
Did mass gainer ruin my appetite? Most meals end after I eat half or less of my portion and if I continue I normally just get sick. I’ve since stopped using the mass gainer but can still hardly finish a slice of pizza without wanting to hurl. For context I’m like 140Lb and dropping fast. This was supposed to help my appetite not ruin it. Thanks everyone
"If I split my workout in two, but still accomplish the whole thing by the end of the day, will that have any negative effects compared to if I do it all in one session? I’m doing AllPros 3x a week. Because my lunch break is fairly long, I can fit in maybe 3 out of the 7 different exercises that I do during it. If I do them during my lunch break and then finish up later in the day, will this hurt my gains or strength at all?"
"Is walking 10k steps excessive when bulking? This is probably a stupid question, but I like to stay active and always be moving regardless of wether or not I need to do something meaning I typically hit over 10-12k steps per day. Is that excessive or should I just not worry about it?"
"My protein waffles turned out pretty dry, any advice? Hello, new gainer here. Having some success with my breakfast gains by doing overnight oats, trying to switch things up on the weekend with some protein waffles.

I used,
1 scoop frosted cinnamon protein powder
1 egg
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
2 heaping tablespoons greek yogurt
sprinkle of salt
bunch of blueberries in the batter (which somewhat burned in the waffle maker)

it turned out like [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/mhdjXtk)

"Help me gain fast! I’ve been losing weight cause of my meds I am on and the doctors say I just need to gain weight like it’s easy.
I’ve been underweight my whole life.
I’m a very active person, I get 10000 steps in daily and so on, but I do not like to eat.
I drink my calories cause it’s easier for me or I eat a lot of carbs and protein.
I’ve been eating and doing very little for a month and lost 5 pounds. I’m now in the dangerous range of weight (102lbs at 16 5’2)
If I don’t get to 110lbs by the end of the month I’m going to be placed in an ED ward.

Any tips welcomed, I’m kinda new and can’t find good information on how to gain"
"Should I put a rest day in my workout routine? So my workout is 

Friday: Chest and Back
Saturday: Legs and Shoulders
Sunday:Chest and back
Monday: Legs and Shoulders

I do this routine once a week and try to hit each muscle group 2 times. My question is should I opt for a rest day between my workout, since I’m still a beginner?

Probably should mention I’m only doing this because of my schedule not out of choice"
"Legs after a cut I’m really curious to know what your experience is with cutting and how much size you lost in your legs. 

I’ve been bulking for quite a while and have gained a good amount of muscle on my legs, but obviously some of it is also fat, since I’ve also become a bit chubby on the rest of my body. 

Usually when I see “before and after” pictures I almost only see people showing off their upper body. Arms, abs and chest etc. But never their legs. I would really like to know if legs tend to loose a lot of size when you cut, and if anyone could share their experience."
"New work sched - can only workout 3 days in a row. Advice? Hi! I'm 22F, been running PPL, but recently my work schedule changed to a 10hr day 4 days a week. These 10 hour days still turn into 12-13 hours with the amount of overtime that happens. 

I am off Sun, mon, tues - so wondering what a good routine switch would be or what I should do differently. Obviously I can't run PPL for only 3 days. 

Thanks!"
"Looking to gain weight in college Hi, I'm trying to gain weight here at my university and I don't have access to a kitchen or anything otherwise I'd be cooking my own meals. The meals here are okay at best and I have a problem with social anxiety so its hard for me to go out and get food in public at times. I've been doing a lot better recently, but it's still hard. I don't really get very hungry unless it's been while since I've eaten. I've also been going to the gym every weekday which is good. I'm mostly wondering what more I can do and how I can get over my anxiety some times. I take calorie shakes as well so that helps me get my calorie goal. I just want to change how I look since I've been skinny all my life and have been made fun of the entire time. I'm 5ft 10 and 132lbs right now."
"Should AMRAPs be a strength TRAINING staple? Disclaimer:  Even though my opinion doesn't matter, I am going to give it to you anyway.  I'm not some record breaker or an overly successful entrepreneur.  I'm just some dude next door that lifts.

Are you a goal-oriented lifter?  Sure you are, you plan your training in advance and probably have a specific way to make sure you're recovering enough e.g. calories, macros, sleep.  The first thing we should ask ourselves in the gym is why are we doing this?  If it does not serve a specific purpose then discard it, Jim Wendler taught me that, but he also taught me AMRAPs, but what purpose do they serve?

AMRAPs serve 2 purposes that I can think of: To do the exercise to complete exhaustion and to measure a repetition max.  I will be focusing on the first one, as going for a rep PR is testing, and training is different than demonstrating. I spent a solid year testing my lifts all of the time and seeing what I could put up instead of lifting what I KNOW I could put up.  This resulted in negative progress and it's a lesson you don't have to learn the hard way, I already did that for you.  

So we are taking a movement to at least technical failure, which is usually done on the last set of an exercise., but how often are you doing that?  Every week?  Every workout? At the end of every exercise?    There are clear benefits we get from training to failure, but you should ask yourself if the pros outweigh the cons.  You will benefit similarly by training close to failure, but it won't cost you as much.  Say you AMRAP the last set of your first exercise in the gym, what do you think that costs?  What did it cost today?  What about the rest of the week?  How many sets or reps did you lose because of it, and likely more importantly, how badly did the quality of the rest of your work suffer?  Well the answer can't be zero or nothing unless it was an isolation movement done at the end of a workout, but I will bring that up later. I want to focus on AMRAPs for compound lifts you do early in training.  If you AMRAP the last set of bench, what happens to your OHP next?  Some people think they're getting away with it, but everything costs something.  

I'd like to get back to goals, and I am an extreme believer in specific goals and specificity in general.  As I mentioned before, you likely have your training written down already, and you know exactly what exercises you will be doing with how many sets logged before you even touch a barbell.  Even if you are using rate of perceived exertion, you have a specific number of reps you want to hit beforehand.  To me, this is undervalued.  Knowing exactly what will be asked of you from the exercise before you approach it is huge; it mentally preps you and tells you the exact amount of effort you will need.  This leads to higher quality sets.  AMRAPs are aimless, you might have an idea of where you'll land, but it's not specific enough, and when things aren't specific enough, they can burden you psychologically. I'm not sure the best way to word it, but if you have trained using AMRAPs I'm sure you know what I mean.  Instead, train with intention, train on purpose, know exactly what you need to ask of yourself so you can do it with intent.  AMRAPs have an unsure element to them, and when you are unsure, then what exactly is your intent?  You are doing something unspecific, you simply cannot have intentions that are specific enough.  This leads to uncertainty.  Training with uncertainty introduces doubt, which is EXTREMELY self-destructive. Doubt is to the soul what pain is to the body.  Set a very specific target and hit it EVERYTIME.  Prescribing yourself reps and hitting all of those reps builds confidence, so you won't have a good reason to doubt yourself.  Your body can only do what your mind tells it to, so train that too.

There is a secret great goal setters have, they know exactly what they want, when they want it, and how they're going to get there.  Saying ""I  want to gain weight"" is good, but we can do better.  ""I want to gain 15lbs by June"", now THAT puts some iron sights on your m4.  Furthermore, you put more on the line with specificity, you know exactly how to approach it.  You can break it down by the month or even week to get more specific and this holds you more accountable more often, especially with a deadline.

Now is AMRAPing your last set of tricep pushdowns or lateral raises going to damage your recovery enough to matter?  Probably not, but I would still argue that having a more specific purpose in ALL of your training is more beneficial to you psychologically, which is definitely the most overlooked thing when it comes to training in general.  

AMRAPs are fine as a metric, as a way to find a repetition max when you are testing.  I do not think it should be a strength training staple though, I find it to be poor mental hygiene."
"Working out throughout the day vs doing it all in one session. Would it be feasible to lift weights and do calisthenics throughout the day (every 2 hours) or would it impact muscle and strength gains? I'm unemployed due to COVID19 and will be for quite some time in the unforeseeable future, so I have a lot of time on my hands."
"Need advice before i start bulking up Hey im 178 (5""10\~)/57kg male and from next week i want to start gaining. So i have some equipment @ home (55 kg of weights) and ive been doing GVT last year. Ive seen progrees, but mainly because i was 53kg and got to 60 in 2.5 months without strict diet.  
Now i look like this [https://imgur.com/a/U70qLyy](https://imgur.com/a/U70qLyy) and equipped with apps\`n\`diets im ready to go for hyperthropy again- this time - proper way.  
Is  layne norton training series good alternative for GVT? (ive heard GVT is not as effective compared to other hyperthrophy plans) And what weights should i use(in GVT it was 60% of max rep.)

Also, as you can see, i have some belly fat (shocker, when i was 53 kg i had 5% BF). Do i have to burn that first with other routines, or can i go straight to bulking up, or maybe i can just work at slight calories deficit? I will be going for visible abs.  
Lastly, did you guys do any stretching routines? And if yes, any recomendations for my crusty knees?  
Sorry for my english, its late and i need veteran\`s opinion, thanks!"
"Trick to eating more: be cool /u/OatsAndWhey made a post a couple weeks ago that mentioned how being warm dulls the appetite as food has a thermic effect. Makes sense as I notice that I get warmer from digesting food. I decided to apply this information to my life.

I eat a large breakfast because I like to get a large chunk of my daily calories in early before I get distracted with other tasks. Often it can be a struggle towards the end of eating it as I get full. So I started opening the window in my room (which can tend to get a little stuffy with the heat running since it's small) and taking off my shirt/pants before I start eating my breakfast. Sounds goofy as hell but it definitely makes it easier to get a large quantity of food down."
"Example Bulking Diets/Advice From Past Eras Greetings Once Again Gainers,

After another 5 day stretch of weird shifts at work with lots of downtime, I've been pouring through the archives over at Physical Culture Study (fantastic website) and read through every single article on weight gaining.  I wanted to pass on some of that knowledge to you in an easy to parse through topic here on the r/gainit.  I cannot personally vouch for any of these approaches, as I've not had the time to employ them, but they come from some of the best in the business and, if nothing else, can serve as a contrast from the now standard ""eat X amount of carbs, Y amount of protein and Z about of fats"" that many of you are failing to find success with.

"M 28 5”11 130-160 Progress 6 months in I am not sure if I am posting this right but since I haven’t been able to get to the gym I have been running the Reddit dumbbell stopgap for the past 6 months. I am super pleased with my progress with only using 15 lb dumbbells 
————————///
I felt like the stop gap wasn’t enough for me so I added Bi’s and tri’s on Tuesday and shoulders and back on Thursday

Diet
Breakfast- 
2 packs of oatmeal with 2 scoops of peanut butter, 1 whole banana and some apple cinnamon cheerios- roughly 935 calories 
Lunch- 
normally I eat whatever we had the Night before or butter noodles with Swanson chunk chicken- roughly 500 calories 
Supper- 
It varies but most of my meals are homemade so it’s hard to track but usually chicken penne with mixed vegetables 
 Snacks- 
cashews with oikos topped with strawberries , these cookie dough bites and honey 
Calories roughly  600  
I also make a hefty shake with protein powder oats, peanut butter and a banana 
MyFitnessPal is a godsend!

———————-/-
I have been slacking off on counting calories ever since the calendar switched over but I have a base that I can work on and I have been happy with my progress 

Conclusion- I am not where I want to be but I am extremely happy with my gains! I want to thank y’all for the knowledge to do this!"
"Question about order in which to do a workout I started a workout plan and I’m curious on the order. Here’s a section

Day 6: Chest

-	Run on Treadmill – 30-50 minutes
-	Barbell Bench Press – Medium Grip – 4 sets, 12 reps
-	Incline Dumbbell Press – 4 sets, 12 reps
-	Dumbbell Bench Press – 4 sets, 12 reps
-	Flat Bench Cable Flyes – 4 sets, to failure
-	Incline Hammer Curls – 4 sets, 12 reps
-	Dips – Chest Version – 4 sets, to failure

So so I do the barbell bench press 4 times before going onto incline? Or since there’s 4 sets of each do I do one of each exercise then start back from the top? Thanks!"
"Bench press plateau at 205 M/6’0”/180lbs, my flat bench press has been stuck at 205 for a while now. I get in about 3000-3200k calories a day, will upping this help me out any? Is there other workout that I can focus on to help strengthen my bench press? I know shoulders can help but I hit shoulders hard twice a week."
"It's been over year of bulking and strict training. Gained 40lbs+ and now feel tired and gaining more weight has become insanely tough. What now? Hi, hope every is doing well. A while ago I posted a progress update on how I went from 54KG to 72kg over a year. I am now 74kg. And I have been stuck here for a while. Obviously, I know to gain weight and break the plateau, but I simply wonder if it's worth it at all. I am hovering at around 3300 calories to maintain. I naturally don't have a big appetite, I had to discipline and force myself to be where I am at today, but I think I reached my breaking point. 

I simply can't take any more food. But on the other hand, I'm still not satisfied with my physique. Well, mostly. If you remember I also ranted about my legs being the only part not developing on par with my upper body so that's why I kept bulking up at 72kg. I thought I could reach 80 but seems to me now insane with how much food I'd have to chuck to get there. So I suppose my legs have to wait a little more.

Now here is what I was thinking and need your advice on this. I'm thinking of doing a cut to re-adjust my calorie intake. Cut back to 70, 68kg. And slowly re-bulking from there. My first bulk was aggressive and that's why I think my calorie intake is so high right now. So I was thinking if I cut and take things slowly again, my calorie intake would readjust. (Idk if I'm brosciencing this lmao.) 

Either way, current measurements: (for reference point, started with empty bar on everything)

- Height: 5'10 / BW: 163lbs

- Bench 1RM &gt; 242lbs (non recorded)

- Squat 1RM &gt; 330lbs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb8tpfMZ-j8)

- Deadlift 1RM &gt; 370lbs (non-recorded)

What I'd look like if I cut back to 70kg: https://i.imgur.com/pihofp2.jpg  (probably a bit better cause I've got more muscle to keep now)"
"Can you split work outs? This might be a dumb question, but is there any disadvantage to splitting workouts occasionally? Say I've had an unexpectedly busy day, can I do half my work out today and half the next? Or is this basically a waste of both days? Obviously I'd do all sets of the same exercise on the same day, so it would be something like press and rows on the day of the first half, and squats and bench on the day of the second half, which would normally be a rest day"
"Massive quads Hey all, I am a very skinny lifter that is very tall. I really would like massive quads. What is the best route to get some killer quads? Heavy squats?"
"Bothering to track exercise calories? Having gone through a big weight loss (37.3kg lost from 104.3kg to 67kg) I'm seriously looking to do a proper bulk now and gain some proper muscle.

However...even though I've been tracking calories for 18 months now, I never included any exercise calories to achieve a deficit. I just stuck to 1600 calories a day and treat any exercise calories as a kind of bonus.

But now, I'm looking at getting 2800 a day I'm not sure whether to bother at all?

I do a PPL routine with 6 days on, one day off and don't plan on tracking that. But I do tend to walk a lot, including a 3.5 mile walk to work and back each weekday plus sometimes more at a weekend.

MFP calculates that as 420 calories burned which for my weight seems a lot?

So wondering if this kind of activity should be factored in or not."
"Should I do any additional lifts or exercises with 5/3/1 BBB? Right now I'm following the plan outlined below with a 15 min jog on the treadmill:

UPPER BODY
- 5/3/1 Bench Press
- 5x10 incline dumbbell press
- 5x10 lat pulldown machine
- 5x10 bicep curls
- 5x10 incline cable fly

LOWER BODY
- Alternating 5/3/1 Squat/Deadlift
- Alternating 5x10 Squat/Deadlift
- 5x10 Crunches
- 5x10 leg extension
- 5x10 leg curl

**Alternating here means that if my primary lift for the day was a deadlift, I do squats for my accessory lift**

I can do these workouts, and it leaves me pretty beat afterwards. Im just wondering of I should be pushing myself more or if this is enough to see some gains."
"Severely Underweight. Need help and advice. Hi,

I am 23M, height 190cm (6ft 3in), 52kg (115 pounds). My BMI is 14.3 which is severely underweight.

Since last week I have started to focus on my diet and I am keeping an account of calories consumed. I was able to consume 2500+ calories/day and my weight increased from 50kg to 52kg in 7 days.

I have gained this weight on a healthy vegan diet - bananas, rice, tofu, soy milk, nuts, veggies, and seeds. On an average per day, I'm consuming high carbs (simple and complex) in excess of 330g, around 60-80g protein intake, and 38g fiber, 40g fat and 99g of sugar. I take Vitamin B12, D3, Omega-3 DHA supplements daily. 

I have done minimal workout at home for 3 days which included squats, plank exercise (tried push-ups but could not do). I am mostly home these days doing desk job, so not much movement. But I go for a walk after dinner. 

My main goal is to reach a healthy BMI (68 kg) first and then increase my weight to the ideal: 80 kg. I do not want to turn all the food I'm consuming into body fat. Therefore, I would like to join the gym and channelize the protein intake into muscle growth. Since I'm quite skinny, I can see bones protruding from my joints and shoulder. Therefore, I am looking to have solid arms, shoulder and calf muscles, for now. Later on I can work on other parts of my body. 

**What do you suggest should I join the gym immediately or do I bulk up for now, hit the 68kg mark, do minimal workout at home, and then later join the gym once I'm in normal BMI region?**

Please let me know. All responses and general meaningful advice are highly appreciated. Thanks in advance."
"Any of you guys get heat rash from sweating at the gym? What do you do for it? I don't want to stop going, but the sweating makes it worse and it's literally becoming unbearable. I'm losing sleep from scratching all the time.

And yes, I do shower after I get back from the gym."
"[Rant] What is with the squeaky chicken?! Anyone else in the US getting ""squeaky"" chicken over the past 18 months? I know that sounds weird, but I have no other way to describe it: It's a very tough piece almost exclusively found in the breast meat that just has an ""off"" texture. Almost like it's rubbery; it kind of squeaks when you chew it. It's not dark meat, it's not gristle (Do chickens even have gristle?), it's not a vein, and it's not fat. As you know, usually chicken breasts are soft in texture while this is extremely tough to chew.  


We, as a family, mostly buy Purdue and sometimes Tyson but I've gotten it in those brands as well as organic brands and store brands. Never the whole breast, never the whole package, just one super off-putting piece here and there. I can push down as many breasts as I need to hit my macros usually, but that squeaky chicken makes me want to throw it all back up. It's making it super hard to eat chicken when I worry whether my next bite is going to be so gross. Anyone else noticing this?"
"My 6 month transformation (+14kg/30lbs) [Progress pics](https://imgur.com/a/5NlG6xu)

Greetings, guys

I can see that everyday some of you good folks make really impressive progress and every single one of you has been an inspiration of mine through this process. So, first of all THANK YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

Little backstory,

I used to be really obese, by obese I mean I was around 100kg of pure fat, no exercise, wasn't moving my body at all and spent my entire days in house playing video games as a teen.

Decided that I have to stop my negative habits if I didn't plan to die by 25 of heart disease or diabetes.

Have to admit that it was really tough process losing all of that weight, not that much physically as mentally challenging it was.

Days, weeks, months went by and eventually with all the hard work I lost that weight. I lost around 66lbs if I recall correctly.

And there came the new phase, the new ""SKINNY ME"".

Pretty much, the only thing about being skinny that I liked is that every clothing piece suited me pretty decent in comparison and the fact that I made it to goal that I set for myself.

Being skinny for some time actually brought up that feeling of being really weak, felt really low with libido too. Didn't feel that strong at all.

So, I decided to step up my game and gain some muscle. And, oh boy, I didn't even realize how hard it actually was. Like, the eating part is probably the hardest. Forcing your body to eat and shoving that food up your mouth is really the worst. Peanut butter is life savior in that case tho.

After few months of peanut butter and feeling sick I came to realization that I actually gained pretty decent amount of weight and when I think about it, now I feel really really strong in comparison when I was skinny.

Don't really like that part where I gained a bit of fat, but the fact that I feel a lot stronger and physically better is compensating in that case.

Overall, I'm pretty happy where I'm at right now.

Keep up the good work guys!

Edit: Dayuuuuuum. Thanks for the award! Glad that you liked my post that much that you decided to give me the award. Thank you!"
"I want to bulk, but am I too fat still to do so? Thanks in advance for any advice or critique.

I'm 24M, currently 82.9kg as of this morning, 182cm tall. According to a FitTrack scale I own, I currently sit at 17.4% BF. I was I believe around mid 20s% when I first started losing fat. Recently I've been focusing on also building muscle in the last few months.

As of this coming weekend I am at the end of a 5 week cut, eating initially 2000, now down to 1900 cals a day, 180+g protein, under 50g of fat (usually well under), the rest carbs.

I'm very keen to bulk and get bigger. I don't want to come off a cut and instantly put all that fat back on, but I also want to maximise my muscle growth from the time, energy and effort I'm putting into my workout and diet routine.

People's opinions differ hugely on if I can bulk or not. Many say if you're above 15% BF, which I am, then you need to keep cutting. Some say cut, maintain, cut, maintain, until you're below 15%, then again, bulk. Others say a small, lean bulk over a long time can cause body recomposition.

My question is: In my situation, what would you do? Switch into a lean bulk? Keep cutting, and if so, until when?

"What to do when you don't have enough weight I am seeing a lot of submissions asking if they should do X if they only have very little weight. While this is not optimal (hate that word, especially for lifting), there are dozens of ways around this.

I usually train with light weights, because I get most of my programming from the 5/3/1 Forever book, and Jim has you base your numbers off of your training max, which is 85% of your 'actual' 1rm. So most of my strength work is around 55-85% of my real 1rm, so it's absurdly light given the rep scheme. This allows me to put a lot of focus into each set and do every rep with intention. I never have the ""let's just get this over with"" attitude, and you won't either if you do your work with intention. Move the bar with a purpose.

**Tempo**
This is my go to; my favorite dance move. I incorporate brief pauses or purposely slow down the eccentric to make the set more challenging. I also like to put a lot of force into the concentric, so if I were to put 20 more pounds on the bar it would still fly up. 

**Rest periods**
Cut them shorter. I was doing 10x5 squats a couple weeks ago and I decided I was going to rest only 30 seconds because it felt very light and I was on my game. I don't use this one as much, because resting let's me visualize the next set and helps me train on purpose. But it's effective and just another form of progressive overload.

**Increase Frequency**
Have you heard of easy strength by dan john? If you don't know who that is then go read about him, he has an old school approach to lifting and is incredibly wise. But easy strength is essentially picking 5 movements and doing them everyday. Ultra high frequency, low intensity and volume. It worked very well for me after I took a hiatus from lifting and returned. 

**Increase volume**
This is an easy fix to low intensity, but I always add a set before increasing reps because it's easier and ensures you're doing more quality work than if you just added a rep to each set. You don't want your 2nd-5th set suffering because you burned yourself out on the first set by jumping the reps too fast.

There are many more approaches to getting stronger/bigger with limited weights such as drop sets or rest:pause, but these are my go tos, and in this specific order. They are all forms of progressive overload, which a lot of beginners think is strictly adding weight to the bar. Get stronger with the least amount of weight possible, it works."
"I’m starting again tomorrow and I just really don’t want to quit I’m starting back at the gym tomorrow. It’s been a few month since I’ve seriously put my head down and been consistent. I’ve dropped from 64KG to 59KG at 17 y/o and 5’10. I just want to gain weight again. I’ve set an alarm for 4.55am (gotta be out by 6.30am). Got the water, the bag, the kit all ready for tomorrow but something different. I just am not sure if I’m even gunna be able to get out of bed, if I’m going to be able to walk to the gym in the cold, if I’m going to be able to have a good breakfast, eat a good lunch, eat a good dinner, get 3k cals in. This means a lot to me but I’ve been sat on my ass for the last 3 months.

And advice?"
"Can you truly gain weight just by consuming protein shakes? Long story short, I've been skinny my whole life. 135-140 lbs, and a week ago I started drinking Serious Mass Gainer Shake daily (1250 calories alone + peanut butter/milk/honey added brings it closer to 1800 calories I estimate). 

Ofcourse I've also tried to eat meals and be near atleast 3000 calories daily. 

I've actually lost like 1-2 lbs according to my scale today so obviously I'm at the beginner stage discouragement seeing that. 

My plan was to gain weight via shakes, then began to do gym multiple times so the weight would turn into appropriate muscle. Can you actually gain (10+ lbs) by drinking shakes daily over an extended period? Anyone who can share their experience/time? How long should I really wait before seeing results?

I'm sure many of the reviews/testimonies I see online claiming people gain weight extremely quick via shakes may be borderline unreasonable and fake too."
"How can I convince my mother to change the food she cooks Hi, I've recently found out that diet is a really important factor when it comes to building muscle and being fit in general, and that's why I recently decided to change it. But the problem is that I'm 15 years old so I still live with my mother and she is the one making the meals, not me (because she won't let me which I can understand). And not only that, but also because of the pandemic she lost her job and we're struggling with money, so it's not like she can afford to buy a meal for me and then a separate one for my sisters. She usually makes either fried chicken with fries, fried fish with fries or legumes (although every now and then she does make better meals like salmon, I'll give her that...). I really don't know what to do and I would appreciate it if you guys could give me some advice. Thanks"
"Do I have enough equipment for linear PPL Hey guys! So I have dumbbells, bench press with 45 lb bar (around 200lbs in plates), squad rack, and a curling bar. I also have a pull up/dip bar. I am a M 18 around 5’8 120lbs just trying to gain weight/muscle and get to 145-150. Is this enough equipment for a linear PPL, or should I look into a different program?"
"Is there an association between ""pump"" and hypertrophy? As I've increased my weights, I've noticed that I feel a quite a bit less pump. I'm still getting good resistance and I think my routine has progressed appropriately in terms of reps in reserve. I'm usually 1-3 away from failure at the end of a set. Also, I still seem to be getting good gains based on tracking my weight and looking in the mirror. 

However, I used to get just awesome pumps, and I simply don't get that feeling to the same extent anymore. The only thing I can think of is that as I have increased weights, I have increased my rest times a bit.

I'm not super worried about it, but it does just seem really odd to me. Curious if anyone else has experienced this or can make sense of it."
"Ease into working out or jump into the deep end? 18M who is very lean for my height who has recently put on a bit of skinny fat weight. Currently I follow a minimalist at home full body workout but now with more time, I’m looking to start a proper workout routine. My goal is to put on muscle while also remaining somewhat lean as I intend to practice and play basketball. With this I also want to improve cardio and explosiveness in my legs.

Basically, I’m unsure if I should begin with an easy, less frequent workout so my body can slowly adapt to a more active lifestyle or if I should hop straight into training 5-7 times a week in total."
"PPL Routine with only adj dumbells and bench Hi there! Looking for some advice. 

So I own :
- adjustable dumbells (5 to 52.5 lbs)
- EZ curl bar ( 10 and 15 lb plates)
- adjustable bench (just the bench no barbell)

Been skinny all my life and I'd like to make a routine (thinking PPL but not married to it ) with the above equipment. Currently weigh 160.

Does this PPL routine sound effective given the equipment I own?

PUSH (tris and chest) :
Flat dumbell bench press 4x10 

Incline db bench press (on alternate sets rest rep-x seconds) 5x10 

Flat db bench press (close elbows to target Triceps) 4x10 

Dumbell JM press 3x9 

Over head tricep extension 2x10 

Dumbbell overhead press 2x10

PULL (Biceps and Back):
Incline bench hanging curl 4x10 

Incline bench hammer curl 4x10 

EZ bar curl 4x8 

Standing hammer 2x10 

Single arm Bent over row 2x10 

Dumbell deadlift 1x12 

DB bent over wide rows 2x12 

Reverse db flies 1x12

LEGS:
Dumbell reverse lunge 3x10

Romanian deadlift 3x10

DB Bulgarian split squat 2x10

Db jump squat 2x10


Is this a good routine with my limited equipment? Also should I lower the reps and increase the weight? I'd really appreciate the input!"

Will post new photos after I finish this program.

# Back story

I've been skinny my whole life (still am, albeit better than before haha). I'm also in terrible shape (being skinny **does not** equal being fit...and fit I am not...I've gotten sore for days helping a friend move a few moving boxes). It's not that I have an eating disorder or anything, I eat really whatever I want whenever I want to. It's just that ""whenever I want"" seems to be naturally less than most. I don't think about food, I don't crave food...if anything, eating is kind of a nuisance for me. There are countless times I've worked an entire day and have completely forgotten to eat. My friends all ""hate me"" because I ""eat whatever I want"" but in all reality, they're just seeing me at at that moment and not seeing all the other times when I put absolutely zero emphasis on food or making an effort to eat it....I'm just generally not hungry, and when I am, I eat something (""something"" being the operative word, as I don't make an effort to eat either healthy or unhealthy...just ends up being food). I think that's probably my biggest issue (although I didn't know it until I began this whole thing). The reason for saying ""my biggest issue"" is that I've tried gaining muscle (unsuccessfully) a multitude of times throughout my life, all with little to no success. I just assumed I was one of those people who ""can't gain muscle"" and left it at that.

# Why I Began

With the whole pandemic going on, I've been seeing a lot of my face on conference calls and the like. I've had a minor issue with my smile (two teeth are a bit crooked). I figured what better time to get Invisalign than now...I'm not physically at work, when I go out I have to wear a mask, etc. Once I got my trays I thought ""well, what else can I change? I've got to wear these things for 8 months, maybe I can ""tie another goal"" into this one"". I landed on making one last attempt at gaining muscle, but figured I'd go all out (both in researching nutrition and the equipment I'd be using). I figured if after the pandemic is over I can have a nice straight smile and look better physically I could essentially treat the pandemic as my personal ""cocoon"" from which I could emerge a...well, I don't want to call myself a butterfly, but you get the gist yeah?

# Why P90X?

Because I was overwhelmed by all the ""at home lift routines"" and wanted something that I could just simply follow, immediately, and not wonder what to do next.  Also because, probably more importantly, as mentioned previously, I'm in terrible shape. I *wanted* to get straight into a lifting program, but deep down I was pretty damn sure I'd hurt myself almost immediately and that'd be the end of it. I wanted to start with ""Body Beast"" but I figured before starting a lifting regimen I should probably get myself into some sort of shape first. Let my nervous and muscular systems ""learn"" how to work together, learn movements, learn ""form"", etc. Not to mention building some cardiovascular endurance. I've read a LOT about P90X, and while it gets a bad rap from some, it still seemed like overall most people endorse it. Now that I've completed P90X I've moved onto Body Beast.

# Nutrition

I have no problem following a workout program, so I knew that wasn't the crux of my problem (I've followed them religiously in the past and gotten no results...and that lack of results caused me to abandon working out altogether as I relegated myself to the ""permanently skinny club""). I researched a ton and landed on doing a 40/30/30 split (protein/carbs/fat) on about 2300 calories a day. Given my aversion to giving food any amount of effort or time, I needed to make things as simple as possible. So I decided on simply eating the exact same thing, every day, with the exception of dinner (I did make sure that my dinner was always a meat, a starch and a fresh vegetable, but it gave me enough daily variation to have at least one thing different). Every single day my routine went (and is back to going):

* **6:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, quarter cup steel cut oats
* **7:30am** \- workout
* **8:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, 1 cup chocolate milk, 1 egg, 2 slices bread
* **12:00pm** \- 1/2 cup cottage cheese, homemade salad (romaine, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers), homemade tuna salad (on top of the salad, which consisted of tuna, hard boiled eggs, onions, mayonnaise)
* **2:00pm** \- homemade smoothie (1 cup mixed fruit \[strawberries, blueberries, raspberries\], orange juice, 1% milk, 3ozs mixed nuts \[cashews, walnuts, almonds, pecans, brazil nuts\])
* **5:30pm** \- dinner
* **8/9pm** \- 1 scoop casein protein powder

I ate (and am back to eating) that exact thing every single day. Some of my friends think it's crazy and that they could never do that...but as it turns out, my indifference to food actually helps me on this point. Because I don't really care what I'm eating, *I never care what I'm eating.* It makes no difference to me that it's the same thing, every day. If anything, it's easier, because I don't have to think about it. I ""meal prep"" on Sundays (cut/chop everything for a weeks worth of salads, make a weeks worth of tuna salad, pre-make my smoothies and freeze them in foodsaver bags). The only thing I make ""on the fly"" is my dinner each night.

**If you have a look at the graphs in the photo** I linked to in the beginning of the post, you'll see me immediately begin to lose weight after November 31st (which was the date I finished P90X and then stopped eating the above and working out regularly).

# Equipment

I wanted to put a fair amount of money into this, as yet another reason to keep me sticking with things (if I'm going to spend over $1,000 on something, it'll keep me motivated on days where said motivation might otherwise be lacking). I bought a Wyze scale, an adjustable weight bench, smoothie machine, 3 months worth of protein powder, BeachBody subscription, water bottle and two 71.5lb AtivaFit adjustable dumbells.

# How it Went

Well, personally, I'm happy with the outcome. I only missed 4 days of the workout program, but otherwise stuck with it ""as prescribed"". Some interesting and entirely unexpected things happened that I'm quite happy about. My skin looks a thousand times better...a few wrinkles have all but disappeared. I had a few areas of eczema on my leg and face as well, and they have **completely** vanished (and they've plagued me for years...I purchase hydrocortisone cream once every month or so...and it's literally gone without a trace now). To say ""I feel a thousand times better"" would be a massive understatement. My energy levels are through the roof, I sleep like a dead body, my relationship has benefited from it (wink wink)...it's, well, amazing.

# What Next

After the roughly month I took off (and the weight I unintentionally lost during that time) I decided to give ""Body Beast"" a shot, now having more confidence that I wouldn't injure myself almost immediately. I'd like to see if I can get to 180lbs and then cut some fat off...I'm noticing that while gaining muscle, my body fat percentage climbs right along with it so presumable if/when I can get to 180lbs, I'll have a fair amount of fat to shave off at that point."
"[Help] Achieving hypertrophy with limited weights? I’m in a situation where I only have access to a barbell with 2x45 pound plates and 2x12 pound plates. I’ve seen some noticeable gains, but I’m wondering how to keep working towards hypertrophy(and aesthetics) in my situation?
I won’t be able to get more weights anytime in the near future, but I don’t want to stall my progress.
The obvious answer seems to be more reps, but there has to be a threshold beyond which more reps would lead to greater fatigue and consequently hinder my gains? How do I move forward?
Any input or tips y’all have for me will be greatly appreciated!"
"I don't even know if I'm doing this because I actually want to get stronger or if it's just to abide by some arbitrary beauty standard to get women. I'm a man that's on the short-side and pretty slim too (5'6, 145 pounds). A big psychological obstacle for me throughout my fitness journey is that I really don't know why I'm here. I'm starting to doubt that I'm really doing this to get stronger, or if I'm doing this because society decided that I wasn't man enough if I wasn't physically strong. Am I doing this because I want to be healthy, or am I doing this because I hate my tiny arms and my undefined chest? Or because of the women on dating profiles listing what they wanted physically and realizing that I didn't meet their standards? If they liked ""skinny"" guys, they want them to be tall and lanky. If they didn't mind short dudes, it's because they made up by being pudgier. In every other aspect of life I feel confident. I think I'm funny, smart, multi-faceted, and a good man with a set of morals and a high code of ethics. But it is this one thing that makes me sensitive when I go to the beach or upload a picture of my body on social media. And then I fall back to what I really feel deep down inside: I think my body is fine just the way it is. In our modern, industrialized society, there's few reasons to be a bodybuilder. And the tribal people today who hunt for their food don't look like bodybuilders. They are my exact height and weight.

Final thoughts edit: I'll still be exercising at the gym, but I'm not going to fret about looking like someone who isn't even biologically possible. I'm just going to go to work on myself so that I can be with the people in my life for as long as possible and hope to see the day where my grandkids don't have to live to meet the ridiculous expectations of others."

Squat 1RM: [https://imgur.com/a/w6Znd1o](https://imgur.com/a/w6Znd1o)

Like most people here I wanted to fit into my clothes better and was getting tired of people commenting on how skinny I was. For the past year I've been running a PPL routine that i've put together with some basic research with one rest day per week. I work out in the morning monday-friday and eat right after I get back from the gym. I am trying to find a new routine focused on powerbuilding as I love trying to push Squat, Bench, and Deadlift while continuing to focus on hypertrophy. I started out in my apartments gym and once I felt I needed more resistance after a month I signed up for a gym membership around mid February and then Covid shut down the gym until June. During that time I just focused on doing light cardio work 3-4 times a week.

Food wise i am rough tracking calories by eating a shake in the morning that is just over 1k calories and then 3-4 small meals throughout the day after that consist of a mix of chicken and past egg and tortilla rollups, salmon/veggie burgers and protein oat peanut butter mix throughout the day. When I've tracked calories it comes out to 2800-3000 calories per day. I am planning on cutting around April, but right now I don't mind the excess belly fat.

Shake Recipe every morning is below:

* 2 cups of milk
* half a frozen banana
* 1 scoop chocolate protein
* 3/4 cup of oats
* 4 tablespoons of peanut butter

Current Maxes. I haven't tried a 1rm deadlift or bench within the past few months

Before:

* Bench 135
* Squat 185
* Deadlift 225

Current

* Bench 225x5
* Squat 315
* Deadlift 335x3. I injured my back earlier in the summer so I haven't been pushing too hard

Push day

* Flat Barbell Bench 5 set of 3-5 reps
* Incline Dumbell bench 4 sets 8-12 reps
* flat bench close grip bench 4 sets 8-12 reps
* Tricep push downs 4 sets 8-12 reps
* Cable flys 3 x8 low 3x8 high
* diamond pushups to failure 3 sets \*dips 3 sets to failure mix between chest and tricep focus

"Huge weight fluctuations I know for a fact I am eating in a surplus, but when i weighed myself this morning after peeing and not eating or drinking, i had lost almost 4 pounds!?!? Should I increase my 300 calorie surplus? I have been tracking for a year btw."
"Can you catch up on sleep and still make proper gains? There are some nights where I get poor sleep and total maybe around 5 hours max. I think it’s usually from Sunday night to Monday morning since on weekends the gym opens later so I wake up later, and so on Monday when the gym opens earlier, i try to wake up earlier since the rest of my day is busy. Sometimes it’s just other nights for whatever reason. 

ANYWAY. If I get a normals night rest the following day, or even a lil more than normal, will I compensate for the night before or did I lose out on muscle growth and such? 

Everything about me I think is on point regarding diet and workout routine."
"Question about pull-ups progress Ι've been doing 3 sets of pull ups three times per week for like 2 months. I can now do 3 sets of 8 but I can't seem to add any more reps or sometimes I can do even less. I want to reach 3 clean sets of 10 before adding extra weight.

How do I progress from now on? Should I add weight and lower the reps? (my main goal is to gain size). I also do ring reverse rows and face pulls for back."
"Can I lower weights during a bulk to focus on form? Hey everyone, sorry if this post gets a little long. 

So basically, I've been working out for about 5 years now, and I don't look it. I'm a PT student so I have a lot of knowledge, good nutrition, consistency, etc. but one major roadblock throughout the entirety of my training has been form. 

I can recognize good/bad form in others, but I am horrible about it when it comes to myself. I can't see myself from all angles, so it's hard to focus on when I'm actually in the gym, but sometimes when the gym is empty I will set up my phone as a camera to check. 

I did that the other day as I hit some DLs, and upon review my back curved A LOT (this explains my recent back pain). Now I'm upset because all the progress I thought I made (finally hit a 1rm of &gt;300) was made with sloppy form. Back to 135 again, I guess. This has happened several times. 

I have decided to do nightly stretches and exercises to strengthen my hip flexors, but one thing has been bugging me. I want to bulk, because after all these years I'm still 185 lbs at ~16% bf. But I can't bulk with bad form...and I cant drop weights and expect to put on muscle either. So...

Do I drop the weight on key lifts for now, and go heavy on isolation exercises where my form is better? Do I drop weights, and get lean while I focus on form? Or do I maintain until I have my form perfected? I'm at an impasse and tired of spinning my wheels. 

Any advice or encouragement is appreciated. Fitness is my passion but I'm still pretty bad at it. 

Thanks!"
"optimum nutrition serious mass for all my nutritionists out there, is serious mass something that will be safe to consume?"
"After Fat loss phase I am happy with my fat% at the moment and my next goal is to build muscle. Should I maintenance before I bulk or should I go straight to bulking, and building muscle? 

Preface: I am doing sports competitively and I go through phases of bulking and cutting regularly to be in top shape for match season."
"I bulked from 130-164lbs. Currently at 16% body fat, lockdown has slowed my progress. Where should I go next? I bulked from 130 to 164lbs.

With the continuous lockdowns its been hard to stay consistent, so I'm not enormously happy with my strength:

Bench: 85kg 
Squat:120kg
Deadlift: 130kg
Overhead press: 55kg
I feel like these should be higher but getting to heavy weight with gyms shut is hard.

I don't look like I'm carrying much fat and have been complimented, but I don't know whether to cut then re-bulk or just keep bulking to get those lift numbers up, maybe to 18-20% bodyfat?"
"Arms lacking in PPL routine G’day guys been doing PPL for a while now and have noticed my arms have seen the least progress.
Usually do 8-10 sets for 12ish reps for bi’s on pull day and similar for tri’s on push day. 

Would it be worth it to throw in a dedicated arm day after legs (PPL,arms,rest,repeat) or would this be to much volume? 

Any help is greatly appreciated thanks!

"[Progress Update] M/29/5' 10"" - 128lbs to 160lbs (2 yrs) [2 year progress pics](https://imgur.com/a/fT3zAFJ)

Hey y'all, back with a 2nd year update. 30 lbs gain in 2 years, def not all muscle but super happy about my progress. Recap: I've struggled with being under weight and having a myriad of GI issues for my entire adult life. I had never weighed above 130 lbs. Only recently have my eating habits felt ""normal"" and holy moly what have I been missing the past 15 years of my life. For the first time \*ever\* I finally feel ... right/normal. I can actually eat a full plate without feeling or needing to throw up. I have enough energy to make it through the day. I don't have to fight off dozing off during work or while driving. I'm not sure exactly what clicked after 28 years, but I know I started consistently working out 2 year ago and other aspects of my health and especially my GI issues started improving drastically.

DIET:

I don't follow a diet plan other then eating somewhat healthy and eating a complete breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. Again, being able to eat more then a bowl of cereal in a day without feeling full is a new experience for me so I honestly just try and eat as much as I can.

ROUTINE:

I \*had\* been hitting the gym 4 days a week generally doing a variation of PPL and little cardio, but since the pandemic I've been doing what I can in my garage ""gym"" - I have an adjustable dumbell set that's done a admirable job. I still get in 45 mins or exercise everyday and tend to stick to a ""at home"" variation of ppl

lmk if y'all want more specifics, have questions or recommendations!"
"Lean bulk - keto or low carb? I’ve started lean/clean bulking and was on keto for two weeks, however I find that a low carb diet is easier to sustain (financially and convenience wise).

Is low carb better for lean bulking then keto or not? The reason I’ve made the switch is because I can’t afford anymore keto foods to increase calories and I’m actually losing weight, on the BMI scale I’m almost underweight."
"Gaining weight without hitting calorie goal daily? A couple of months ago I was 185 and I’m shocked to see that I’m currently 199 exactly (6’2). 

Because of life, there have been many days where I don’t even come close to my daily goal, but despite that I’m gaining at a good pace and I don’t really understand how or why.

On an ideal day I eat 3 meals and drink my shake that rounds out to about 990 calories with rarely any snacking throughout the day.

Mornings are usually 3-4 eggs, toast, with some variation of a side , then I make my shake which I drink throughout the next few hours. Lunch has typically been a double wrap burrito from chipotle at LEAST 3 times a week. It’s expensive but hopefully it’s paying off. Dinner is whatever my mom makes, which I appreciate since I’m busy with school. It’s honestly hard to keep track of my calories for things like homemade food not prepared by me, but I typically stuff myself with whatever food is there and hope for the best which you will probably flame me for, but it seems to be working so far. I also drink half a gallon of water throughout the day and that’s it.

As I’ve mentioned there are just days where I simply don’t get it done. It’s usually the weekends, where I have a time commitment from the very early morning to almost mid afternoon. I eat breakfast (Bacon Egg and Cheese + Coffee from Dunkin’) those days, and will probably eat a late lunch (Moes or Chipotle) after I’m done with my obligations. But by the time I get home on weekends (after legs on Saturday especially) I find myself having been too tired to go and make my shake/figure out dinner. I just shower and crash until the next day. Let’s assume I get 1600 calories on those weekend days from my two meals.

Sorry for rambling, but my main question revolves around whether or not the “calorie goal” is as strict as people make it seem. Is there supposed to be room for error? I figured when people stress the daily aspect, it’s for a reason.

On average I may have 4 great days of eating a week, one solid, and two where I know I didn’t eat enough. Despite that though, I’ve had gained steadily. 

Primary goal is muscle gain and I’m trying to bulk up on a PPL Split for 6 days a week thanks to recommendations from some of you guys. Started a few weeks ago. Thanks in advance."
"[Training/Gaining] Cardio &amp; Conditioning Work is IMPERATIVE! This topic comes up all the time, but evidently it needs to be repeated again:

**YOU MUST DO CARDIO.**

Cardio &amp; Conditioning Work is not optional, and it's not a suggestion. It's a MUST-DO. This is a non-negotiable.

- ""But I'm only trying to build muscle, I have no interest in building endurance""...

- ""I'm already a hard-gainer as it is. I don't want to burn the additional calories""...

- ""I just don't have time to do cardio, it's boring; I mean really, really boring"" etc.

Have you ever said any of these things? These are the most common excuses for skipping cardio &amp; conditioning.

Never mind the manifold health benefits for cardio. Never mind the fact it can help boost appetite significantly. 

Let's look at this instead through the lens of this metaphor: YOUR BODY IS AN ENGINE. (Well, *you* are the *vehicle,* and your muscles are the engine, rather). You are much like a finely-tuned machine that creates movement and work. And how does a motor accomplish this? It's the pistons firing up &amp; down that drive the transmission, which translates into rotation of the wheels. We all understand that the force of the internal combustion engine is what moves the car or truck along. Are you with me so far?

Well, how would you build a stronger engine, an engine with more torque or more horsepower? The fastest route is through a simple increase in DISPLACEMENT. (I say ""simple"", but it's anything but that. It requires a great deal of machining to do this. Honestly, it would be faster to just swap out engines altogether. But I digress). So what would that look like? You would bore out each of the cylinders to a larger diameter, and swap out the pistons with larger ones. In a nutshell, you would increase the total cubic inches of volume wherein the combustion happens. Does that make sense?

*More displacement equals more fuel/air mixture equals bigger boom equals more force.*

In a limited sense, this would be a way to achieve ""engine hypertrophy"". You make a bigger engine.

But in practice, can you do (only) this? Can you simply make your internal combustion chamber larger and have it work?

**NO.** No it's not enough to have a larger engine block. And why is this? Because there's a host of other mechanical mechanisms that also need to be in place to support an increase in displacement. You would also want to re-machine the valve openings and install larger valves (to let fuel in, and let exhaust out more rapidly). The engine would also require larger diameter intake &amp; exhaust manifolds. It would also likely require a higher-flow fuel pump. It would also overheat easier, which would necessitate a more robust cooling system (higher pressure &amp; higher volume of engine coolant) etc.

All these requirements are based on the fact that a larger combustion process requires more air to match the increase in gasoline which fuels the process. A larger engine also results in a higher volume of exhaust gases after the explosion. The combustion of a larger engine runs hotter, which means the cooling requirements are greater. The whole point of this allegory is YOU CAN'T SIMPLY MAKE A LARGER ENGINE. All the supporting systems will need to be upgraded too.

Again, this is just a metaphor. But the thrust of my post is thus: *If you build bigger muscles through lifting, you're also going to need to upgrade your supporting physiological processes!* So stop thinking of ""cardio"" as for ""endurance"" only. Instead, envision cardio as HELPING YOUR MUSCLES **BREATHE.** Your ability to lift a meaningful volume of challenging sets within a reasonable time depends on your muscles ability to get adequate fuel, to dispose of metabolic wastes efficiently, and to oxygenate all of the tissues that are involved in performing the lift itself.

Is resistance-training enough to improve your resistance training? No, it's not. Lifting in &amp; of itself doesn't burn a ton of calories, and it doesn't really ramp up mitochondrial activity. Supplemental cardio &amp; conditioning work will increase your total energy in the gym. It will make higher-rep sets easier to hit. It will help you be ready for the next set sooner. It will reduce muscle soreness in the days following each session. It will help get glycogen &amp; nutrients back into the muscle and tendon, to repair them faster and more efficiently. It will increase insulin sensitivity significantly etc. etc.

If you're bulking in a massing phase, you should be doing even *more* cardio than when you're cutting!

If you want to minimize fat accumulation on a bulk, you need to be doing more cardio &amp; conditioning!

If you're having difficulty recovering, but you're eating &amp; sleeping enough, you likely need more cardio!

Cardio/Conditioning can be as simple as adding a couple of brisk walks every single day. Two 10-minute walks are quick, easy, require no special equipment, and can be done right outside your front door. You don't need to suit up, drive to the gym, and sweat out on a stairclimber for an hour (unless you enjoy that!). Simply add brisk walks a couple times per day, every day. If you ever feel drowsy after a big meal, go for a walk. It tends to energize you, and pick you right back up.

Another favorite of mine is skipping rope. For a small investment ($12-15 bucks), you can get a jump rope and skip for 5-10 minutes per day (this is in addition to the brisk walking). I like intervals (skip for 20 seconds, pause for 10 seconds, repeat). Or shoot for a total number (100 skips, 500 skips, whatever). Just get better at it, and build up volume over time. A little bit every day, every other day, adds nothing to your allostatic load. It's not really fatiguing whatsoever.

What else can be done with little/no equipment? HILL SPRINTS. (Find a hill, run up it, walk back down, sprint back up. Repeat a few times). The goal with the heavier conditioning like this is to get winded; you *want* to get out of breathe, and continue to keep pushing into it. If you have a backpack, you can fill it with books and/or a couple dumbbells, and walk with that for distance, hopefully uphill! Wrap those weights in a blanket or pillow, and walk for 30-45 minutes. A canvas bag can also be purchased for little cost, and filled with sandbags. This can be used for front carries etc.

Look, I know cardio is additional work. But if you want to make the most of a bulking phase, ADD CARDIO.

Just move more every day, and make a point of getting winded/gassed/totally-out-of-breath a couple times per week.

Your total energy will go up, your focus &amp; attention will improve, your gym aggression and recovery will increase.

There's like 20 different reasons to add cardio/conditioning work, but I can't think of a single reason NOT to.

"Question about the main lift in ppl Why is there no rep range for the main lift? It seems like way too ambitious to put on 5 pounds every time you main lift and do 5x5. The accessory lifts have 8-12 rep range and when u can do 12 u put on weight and go back down to 8 reps which makes more sense.

"[Progress] M/23/6'2"" - 155-&gt;175lbs - 1 Year - No Barbell Lifts So I've just reached the 1 year progress point and thought I'd post on reddit which has been my main place for motivation and advice. I haven't made major progress but I'm happy with where I'm at.

I haven't been to the gym once since I started my fitness journey. At the start I just wanted to do some home workouts with dumbbells and build a foundation to then go to the gym, but then the pandemic came. Because of this I have never done any barbell lifts and I haven't attempted a pull up ever. I can't get a pull up bar as I am too afraid of damaging the door frames in my rented apartment.

# Before and After Pictures

1 Year progress, going from 155lbs to around 175lbs at the moment. Height is around 6'2"".

[https://imgur.com/a/H6seKZz](https://imgur.com/a/H6seKZz) \- **0,4,8,10,12 Month Progress**

# Training

I started out with a dumbbell full body workout that I found on Simeon Panda's YouTube that had some basic exercises that consisted of:

* **Pushups, Bent Over Rows, Bicep Curls, Tricep Kickbacks, Overhead Press, Squats, Stiff-Legged Deadlift, Leg Raises**

In the beginning I couldn't do one push up and used very light weights, doing 2 sets of 8-12 reps. After a month or two I started doing 3 sets. I would do this workout whenever I felt like it, sometimes everyday for a week and other times just once or twice a week.

After a few months of that I progressed into a PPL dumbbell split that I've been doing ever since. My dumbbells only go up to 45lbs so I can't do anything crazy.

Dumbbell PPL Routine:

Day 1 -

***Chest, Shoulders &amp; Triceps***

* **Pushups / Floor Press - 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Flys - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**

* **Dumbbell Side Raise - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Diamond Push Ups - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Tricep Kickbacks / Skullcrushers - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**

Day 2 -

***Back &amp; Biceps***

* **Dumbbell Bent Over Row - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **One Arm Dumbbell Row - 5 Sets, 8-12e. Reps**
* **Dumbbell Bicep Curl - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Hammer Curl - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**

I do a version of that ab workout every day or two with some variations now and then. Admittedly I've skipped a lot of leg days, they are just not as enjoyable as the upper body days. Maybe once I get under the squat rack I'll enjoy them more.

Now I can do around 15-20 pushups in one set and feel much more comfortable doing them. I add weight to the dumbbells each week to try and make progress but it's hard since I only have a limited amount of weight to add.

# Diet

When I started working out I had just started learning how to cook so I was having 3 meals everyday and probably getting around 2500 calories in most days. I bought a mass gainer powder that I'd have 3 scoops of with 700-800ml of milk after a workout.

As for my diet right now, I try to get in 3000-4000 calories. I succeed most days but its not always the cleanest food. I usually get between 120-180g of protein. For breakfast I have 3 Weetabix with chocolate soya milk, a banana and a glass of fruit juice every morning, around 700kcal. My lunches vary. I was making a green smoothie with fruit juice, an avocado, spinach and peanut butter that was around 700kcal but it was too expensive so I've stopped making it. I'll usually have a sandwich and a couple clementine's or Baked beans on toast, lets say 500kcal. Dinner is usually around 800-900kcal, my go to meals are Tuna pasta, Chicken fried rice with chicken breast and 2 eggs, Beef burgers, Chicken breast with a sauce, rice and broccoli, etc. About 30 minutes to an hour after my dinner I'll have a protein smoothie that's around 700-800kcal. 400ml milk, 1 banana, 1 or 2 tbsp. of peanut butter, 1tsp. Nutella, 1 scoop whey protein. Around 10 or 11pm I'll have something else to eat, usually another sandwich or a couple pb&amp;j sandwiches. That's about all I eat + some other snacks and unhealthy foods in-between. I'm going to start having a glass of whole milk with my lunch and later meal to get some more calories in. I definitely have more space to eat as I have a big appetite it's just I don't really enjoy eating and don't know what to eat without being super unhealthy.

I don't take any supplements or creatine, except protein powder.

Hopefully the world returns to normal soon and I can make some real gains in the gym. I'm pleased with the progress I've made though and hope to continue gaining weight this year.

Advice and tips on what I could change and improve on are appreciated. Also feel free to post your favorite meals for lunch and dinner to give me some more ideas on what to have. Thanks for reading."
Is it alright to join a gym when I'm so weak that I can't even do 5 straight push-ups? I'm a 5'5 123 lb M. About 8-9 lbs gain was the belly fat I gained during the quarantine and now I have around 20-25% body fat lol. But anyways my friend convinced me to join the gym starting next month and I wanna gain muscle as well as build up my strength. But I'm afraid that with my current strength I wouldn't be able to life even 4kg dumbells. Is it alright to join the gym or can I do some alternate exercises for a few weeks and then go to the gym?

I am pretty skinny, almost skinny fat tho I’d say. I stumbled upon this subreddit after wanting to bulk up and gain muscle mass for a long while. And finally thought I would something about it.

MFP recommended about 3000 calories but all the TDEE calculators have recommended about 3500ish so I went with that. I normally eat large portions anyway so it’s not that much of an issue to eat more tbh. I am planning to workout 5 days a week following a dumbbell only workout plan (Link:[Workout Plan](https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/workouts/dumbbellworkout5day_0.pdf)

And this is what I’ve been eating this week:

I wake up at 5 and do my workout/attempted yoga and meditation for my mind. Finish somewhere around 6:30 for the lot.

Then I have my breakfast at about 8ish after getting to work:

Berroca + 1 pint/1L of water.
60g mornflake oats
Crave dale full fat milk 250ml
1 tbsp peanut butter KP
1 tsp honey
1 black coffee
Multivitamin

Then at about 12-1ish I have lunch.

This week it’s been:
100g basmati white rice
25g baked oven crisps
1 Pepsi max 
1 wagon wheel
1 tbsp Nando’s Perinase 
50-100gram tenderstem broccoli 
100g green beans
350g chicken breast

Dinner varies as other people in my family eat differently but an example meal would be:

4 Thick pork sausages
100g peas 
400g mash
150ml gravy

Snacks
50g Bombay mix
1 apple 
1 banana 

I’m have about 3L water a day (hopefully)


What do you guys think this day in particular macro wise was 

2869 calories 
175g Protein
98g fat
(35g saturated fats)
309g carbs

I am planning buying the extreme gainer protein powder from my protein as I get 50% off and it looks decent. And having that after workouts with oats peanut butter honey and full fat milk.

"Help with bulking Hello,

I (18M 5’10.5” 148lb) have been currently trying to bulk since mid-late December. My routine is usually as follows:

Monday: Pull day

Tuesday: HIIT workout

Wednesday : Leg day

Thursday: Running if possible

Friday: Push day

Saturday: HIIT workout 

Sunday: Indoor cycle if possible 

(On my running days, I do interval sprints for 45 minutes-1 hour or so. On cycle days, it’s about the same. On HIIT workouts, it’s usually a 35 or 40 minute workout from Fitness Blender.)

My main question is: am I doing too much cardio that ruins my muscle growth? I go as hard as possible on lifting days, so that’s not a problem. However, (especially with running), I feel that I do too much cardio and it’s ruining my gains. I also try to eat more calories than I burn and usually eat chicken, pasta, steak, fish, and other high-protein foods in my meals, as well as a protein bar, frozen fruit protein shake, a banana, a mandarin, and a spinach salad with eggs, bacon, and eggs everyday. 


Should I lift on some cardio days, tone down the cardio, or do something else?"
"Digestion Issues/Bathroom while Bulking Anyone have digestion problems while bulking? I used to be pretty regular in the morning but now have trouble after waking up and usually end up feeling bloated when I weigh in?

I make sure to get enough fiber, eating plenty of whole foods, and am drinking a lot of water, in addition to walking in the morning to aid digestion. Anyone have any tips or experienced the same?"
"Will it still be okay if I stop doing flat bench presses for decline and incline presses? I absolutely hate doing flat and I also find them super hard. I’m a beginner and I can only bench 105lb for 4x8. However, I absolutely enjoy doing incline and decline presses. So I’m wondering if my chest day will still be okay if I stop doing flat and do those 2 instead. 

My chest day would look something like this:


Decline Press 4x8-12

Incline Press 4x8-12

Chest Flies Machine 4x8-12

iso lateral wide chest (machine?) 4x8-12"
"Am I doing pull-ups right? Hey guys, sorry if this is the wrong place for that. I am wondering if you could critic the form of my pull-ups. I am kind of a noob, started lifting a few months ago.

I am 1m78 for 73kg (5'10 160lbs), here is the first set. 13rep with +5kg (11lbs). Thank you very much!

"Overnight oat bulk? I looooove overnight oats. I eat 100g every day with 1.5 cups of whole milk, blueberries, and brown sugar. However, I've recently been having trouble hitting my daily calorie goal. Aside from food boredom, would there be any adverse health effects if I bump this up to two 100g servings per day? (assuming my other meals contain a variety of foods in order to get all the minerals and vitamins I need)"
"OFFICE DRONE GAINING: What to buy, how to train, what snacks to bring Greetings Once Again Gainers,

Like many of you gainers, I work an office job in front of a computer at a desk that has minimal physical demand and lots of sitting.  This allows for unique opportunities for gaining, IF one is willing to take a few unique actions in order to maximize the potential contained within.  I wanted to share some tips I’ve picked up along the way so that you can make the most of your situation.  This should work for those of you that are stuck in an office OR for those of you that are full time students, but even those of you with less sedentary lifestyles may be able to pick something up from it.

---

**THINGS TO BUY** 

* INSULATED LUNCHBOX.  Having a way to bring food to the office is key to ensuring you have food to eat.  You don’t want to eat out for every meal, as it’s costly and you have minimal control over food quality.  You also run the risk of losing your parking space if you leave for lunch.  AND, if you bring food, you don’t run the risk of working through lunch, which is typical for you workaholics.  My wife bought me [this one]( https://www.amazon.com/Performa-Punisher-MealPrep-Bag-Accommodate/dp/B077GRQFQN/ref=sr_1_35?dchild=1&amp;keywords=punisher+insulated+lunch+box&amp;qid=1611162229&amp;sr=8-35) for my birthday, and it’s really awesome, but you can get something simple.  The other benefit of having your own lunchbox is you can keep your food in it and next to you vs using the office communal fridge, which prevents food thieves from eating your lunch and leaving you hungry.  And, of course, I keep writing “lunch”, but in truth, I pack a LOT of food for work.  I literally eat something every hour that I’m at work, and that lunchbox goes a long way to ensure that I have enough food to get me through my shift.

* STAINLESS STEEL WATER BOTTLE.  I like a [half gallon size]( https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Bottle-AOZEX-Insulated-Leakproof/dp/B085S6M2TR/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3QOFYWV32ZGIW&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=stainless+steel+half+gallon+water+bottle&amp;qid=1611162464&amp;sprefix=stainless+steel+half+gall%2Caps%2C179&amp;sr=8-8) like that one.  If you’re gaining, you’re eating a lot of protein.  Protein, as a macronutrient, requires more water for digestion than any other macronutrient.  It’s why most “survival food” has minimal protein in it and much more fats and carbs.  But you don’t run the risk of dying of dehydration in an office IF you’re keeping hydrated.  The other perk about drinking a lot of water while working is that it will force you to get up more frequently so that you can go use the bathroom, which can prevent the maladies associated with remaining in a seated position for so long.  I aim to fill and drink this 3 times in a shift, getting in 6 liters of water a day.  Oh yeah, and steel tends to have less toxins associated with it compared to drinking from plastic bottles, and this is environmentally friendly compared to junking a bunch of single use plastic bottles, so that’s cool too.

* GLASS FOOD CONTAINERS. [This]( https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Storage-Containers-Piece-Proof/dp/B082SN4QH6/ref=sr_1_4?crid=X03R665LMPQ6&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=glass+storage+containers&amp;qid=1611162677&amp;sprefix=glass%2Caps%2C196&amp;sr=8-4) is the set I have, but there are a ton out there.  That lunchbox I linked came with containers, and I still use them for veggies and sandwiches, but when it comes to food that needs reheating or has sauces/staining elements to it, glass is the way to go. Zapping plastic in the microwave never sits well with me, and if you put something with pasta sauce in a plastic container the stain never gets out.  I also find that food tends to stay fresher in glass containers, which is great if you make things in bulk and eat them throughout the week.  I’ve had leftover last MUCH longer once I switched from tupperwear to glass containers. 

* GRIPPERS.  [Captains of Crush are King]( https://www.amazon.com/IronMind-Captains-Crush-Hand-Gripper/dp/B0094WEFJM/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=captains+of+crush+grippers&amp;qid=1611165376&amp;sr=8-4), but I have heard good things about heavy grippers as well.  These are great toys to have at the office whenever you have some downtime and wanna get in some sort of training.  People tend to neglect their grip a lot in their training, and these dudes will right fix that.  Make no mistake: these aren’t sporting goods store grippers that you’re going to mindlessly click for a million reps: this is a real workout.  

* PLASTIC OR BAMBOO SILVERARE.  If you’re fortunate enough to have your own desk, make sure it has a lot of ready to go silverware in it.  Nothing is worse than packing a whole bunch of food for work and then finding out you have no way of eating it because you forgot to pack THAT.  Consequently, I picked up some [bamboo silverware]( https://www.amazon.com/Bamboo-Utensils-Cutlery-Set-BEWBOW/dp/B07MGVXFWJ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&amp;keywords=bamboo+silverware&amp;qid=1611162990&amp;sr=8-9) that is attached to my lunchbox now so that I know I’ll never be without.  Also great when there are surprise office birthdays, because people always remember the cake and always forget the forks.

* SLOW COOKER/INSTANT POT.  I’ve written about all this already in my post on [bachelor bulking]( https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ijjm9h/bachelor_bulking_quit_making_shakes_learn_how_to/), but seriously, get some sort of way to make a lot of food with little effort, put it in the BIG glass container, then transition it to the little glass containers and put that in your lunchbox for the day.

**THINGS TO DO** (workouts before work, full sessions, conditioning sessions, tabata)
* WORKOUT BEFORE WORK.  One of the best things you, as a gainer, can do is to workout BEFORE you get to work.  Why?  Because training makes you hungry, and if you’re struggling to gain, increasing appetite before you get to work is a GOOD thing.  Sure, it also helps make you awake and is good for health and all that, but we’re talking about gaining here.  You can either do a full on lifting workout, a 10-20 minute conditioning workout, OR you could even do a simple short Tabata style workout.

If you’re unfamiliar with what Tabata is: [here]( https://www.t-nation.com/training/tabata-method) is a great article on it by Dan John.  Yeah, it talks about fat loss, but since we’re using it to TRIGGER appetite and THEN eat, it works well for our purposes.  Burpees are a great movement to use this on, as they require no equipment and you can knock it out stupidly quick.  If you have MORE than 4 minutes, look for some Crossfit WODs or just do a simple circuit workout.  You could do something like 5 burpees-10 push ups-20 squats for as many rounds as possible in 10-20 minutes.  Either way, get in the training BEFORE work and then spend the entire time you’re there eating out of that lunch box.  And speaking of eating…

*OFFICE DRONE SNACKS**
These are the foods you should have at your desk, ready to go at a moment’s notice to get your gain on.

* PROTEIN BARS.  I’m a big fan of [Quest](https://www.questnutrition.com/collections/protein-bars), but there are tons of great brands out there.  Costco sells a knock off of Quest that is quite good and cheap, and I buy a lot of those as well.  These are perfect to keep at the desk or in a backpack/pocket for when you need to get on a protein fix.

* NUTS.  I’m not going to link you to nuts: you can figure that out.  But nuts have just TONS of positive qualities associated with them due to their healtful fats, and they are very calorie dense.  Have a jar at your desk.

* DRIED FRUIT.  Raisins, prunes, dates, figs, whatever.  These things don’t spoil and are packed with calories, along with nutrients.  Another fantastic snack.

* NUT BUTTERS.  Peanut butter, almond, cashew, etc.  This, combined with your plastic or bamboo spoon, is absolute money for a quick and easy snack.  I’m actually really into the brand [Nuts N More]( https://nuts-n-more.com/collections/online-store), which is a peanut/almond butter mixed with a protein powder for a slightly better macro breakdown, but as long as you stick with the natural stuff that requires stirring you should be just fine.

* INSTANT OATMEAL.  I like [this brand]( https://www.betteroats.com/), because it coming with it’s own measuring pouch is pretty cool, but again, there are a lot of choices out there.  Instant oatmeal is a real treat on a cold day, and you can use your office microwave or coffee maker to get some hot water to make this quick. 

* POP TARTS.  Man I love pop tarts.  That said, you probably shouldn’t eat them.  …but man I love pop tarts.

"125 to 180 lbs in 1 year 5 months Weight Gain Progress Post https://imgur.com/a/NcJKc2N

Since August 2019, my 5 rep exercises have gone from:

1 set, 5 reps:
Deadlift: 150lbs, 305lbs

Everything else is 5x5:

Squat: 135lbs, 270lbs

Bench press: 95lbs, 165 lbs

Overhead press: 55lbs, 115lbs

Barbell row: 85lbs, 165lbs

Keep in mind these second numbers are just what I’m currently progressing through on PPL (through the Clank app), not like an official max or anything. 

I just don’t know where to go from here. I want to be, you know, jacked, but don’t know if I get there through bulking (I’ve pretty much been on a bulk since I started), or cutting then bulking again. I included pics where I’m flexing but also just passive to show how far my stomach can extend. I’m 180lbs, 5’8”, 18 y/o. From the front, my arms seem kind of lacking but then in other pictures they look okay. Don’t really know where to go to get where I wanna be, through switching programs, cutting or bulking, etc. Been eating 3500 cals almost everyday, definitely getting enough protein.

Also how’s my progress in general? Could it have been better? Thanks."

"Programming for a Client I work in a social work setting (I'm not a clinician, more like a counselor) with a client who is interested in gaining muscle mass. Our program has strict rules (for liability purposes) around supporting clients at the gym, specifically around not giving them direct instructions (like I can't show him how to squat) and not spotting (so no heavy weights). Is there a beginners program that I can point him to that fits these restrictions? He hates machines and used to lift in high school, but hasn't for awhile. I only have time to bring him once per week and he isn't interested in going more often since he only likes to go with me.

"Metallicadpa PPL leg day Is it ok to do one leg day as written: 2x5,1x5+, but then the second day be 3x8-12? I go to failure for the AMRAP and doing that twice a week is starting to make my progressive overload stall. If I change it, it will be adding 5 lbs each week instead of the collective 10 lbs. I think I will be way more refreshed to add weight and push it for AMRAP if I just do that once a week. All the other lifts are the same way, why not the squats? Or is it because it is only 3 sets instead of 5?"
"Do I hate lifting or do I just hate the program I'm running I feel like I've just reached a point where I straight up don't want to do the workouts my coach programs. When I do more bodybuilding focused workouts, I have no desire to because I just don't find them fun (I understand it's not all supposed to be fun but shit I should at least feel like I want to go to the gym).

When I do powerlifting or powerbuilding workouts I feel like I go too heavy and end up with joint pain which puts me out of commission for bench (for example) for at least two weeks to heal.

Is lifting just not for me, and I'm only realizing after almost 3 years of getting a bit bigger and adding only 45 lbs to my deadlift max, keeping my bench max about the same, and squat max going up about 80 lbs. Is it my coach? Is it that my body isn't built for this shit and I just need drugs to keep up?

"Not gaining muscle? I'm 23 and currently weigh about 62 kg. I've been going to the gym for the past 1.5 years and I've yet to notice any significant muscle gain. Although I've put on weight, it mostly (or exclusively?) seems to be fat. Even at my current weight I have quite a bit of belly fat. The only time when I did not have any protruding belly fat was when I was 55.5 kg. That was last July. I've been lean bulking since and over the months I put on 5-6 kilos, but like O said, all of this seems to have just become fat. 

I do train properly, eat 0.8 g/pound protein a day and follow progressive overload. I was 56.5 when I started lifting weights, but made a mistake and dirty bulked, went upto 65, then I cut and went down to 55.5 (over the course of 7 months) to get rid of my lower belly fat and then I started lean bulking. The thing is I don't see any weight gain in terms of muscle, it all just seems to be fat. 

Now, I do have to mention that I have hypothyroidism, but I get check ups regularly and they are in acceptable ranges for the most part. I also got a testosterone test done and the result was 380 ng/dl which I understand to be quite low. 

Is my low testosterone the cause of me not putting on muscle or is it something else I'm doing wrong? Thanks in advance."

#2.1. Training  (part 1 June 2019 - August 2020)

So when I first started working out, I didn't know anything about how to exercise. At the very beginning I couldn't even do a normal push up I was so weak. I didn't even know pull ups were a thing or the fact you had to actually train your back. I didn't start working to get jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. And the only exercises I knew were push ups, sit ups and squats. I didn't have any equipments, neither did I have time or money to go to a gym. I first started with an app called 30 Day Home Workout Challenge or something like that. It had different variations of push ups and sit ups. It took me about 3 months to build up to 10 normal push ups. During this time I was watching a lot of YouTube videos about bodyweight workouts and fitness in general. I didn't have a pull up bar. So I did my pull ups first on a door ledge and then on a collapsible gate with towels wrapped around it otherwise my hands would bleed. The first time I did negative pull ups, after mere 3 reps I had incredible pain in my elbows that lasted almost a whole week. I could neither fully straighten or bend my arms. However I kept going and slowly, very slowly got better until I could do it for some reps without pain.

I had also stopped using that app and was trying things myself. However I didn't know what I was doing. I thought I knew everything from watching YouTube videos but clearly that was not the case. I was following AthleanX and was doing 17 different curl variations with my 25lbs red resistance tube. Most of my exercises were of the same intensity (didn't change the progressions to make it harder) and I always did everything to failure. Was trying out different things like density training, drop set everything, mechanical drop set everything and what not. I was the perfect example of doing fuckaroundities.

Around last year March it slowly occurred to me that I was not moving forward. There was no progress. In fact, I made all the progress in the first 5-6 months and for almost a year I didn't make any progress. Neither strength not physique wise.

I was now following a workout app called Calisthenics. It's not too bad except it used ridiculously high volume and hardly any change in intensity. I was exhausted after each session, but no substantial progress was made... (to be continued)

● Strength level during this period - 10-12 pull ups, 25 push ups, 12 dips (all max)

#2.2. Training (part 2 August 2020 - Now)

I was becoming suspicious of what I was doing and the advice I was getting. During this time (May-June 2020) I read the book Power to the People by Pavel Insulin and it almost completely changed the way I looked at exercising. It was something very new and interesting. I started getting more and more curious about the concept of strength training; started reading more about it on the internet, frequently visiting Powerlifting related forums and getting more knowledge about bodyweight training. Then I got the book ""Science and Practice of Strength Training"" by Vladimir Zatsiorsky and ""Building the Gymnatics Body"" by Christopher Sommer.  And it changed everything. 

I started building and following my own routine and made huge changes to my training (this is around August-September). The major changes was making the rep range 3-5, upping the intensity, taking more rest time, reducing the number of exercises and focusing compound movements while applying the concept of progressive overload. And my strength increased rapidly!

It's important to know that all this while I was training at home at around 3am (then I used to sleep at daytime and stayed up all night). And for equipment I only had a light red resistance band. I used the kitchen counter to do dips and used an old backpack + some bricks for extra weight in pull ups and dips. In June I bought a pair of gymnastics rings which I hung from the gate. And in late October I started going to the park very early morning (5am) worked out there. I also bought a heavy band (50-70lbs) this November.

● Current strength level - max weighted pull ups is approx 25kg (with a brick between my legs), max weighted dip would be around 30kg (I can do about 4-5 reps with the same brick mentioned above). Chest to Wall Handstand Push Up 5 reps (still can't balance a handstand). 3-4 one arm push ups on each arm (clean form). I can hold a straddle front lever for 5-6 seconds but I'm not training Front Lever anymore so that I can fully focus on one arm chin up training. For one arm chin up I can do band assisted (same light band) OAC with 1 finger distance from the ring and where I hold the band. For back lever (supinated) I can hold about 10s of advance tuck open hips, I feel like I'm almost ready for straddle. I'm also training for bent arm planche on Rings where I'm at around 12-15s with advance tuck open hip position. I'm working on my handstand but still can't balance it. I can hold an L Sit on the floor for 20s. Max bodyweight pull is 15-16. I can also do about 5-6 full Dragon Flag however I never trained for it.

#3. Routine

I follow a template, not a fixed routine as exercises keep changing as I move up the progression ladder. It looks somewhat like this -

Day 1. 

A. OAC Progression 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B1. Back Lever 3-4 sets of 3-5/5s-15s superset with 
B2. 10 Reverse Hyperextension (3 min rest)

C1. Weighted pull up 3 sets of 6-8 (2 min rest)
False Grip Hang 3 sets of max hold superset with 
C2. Bicep curls with that ~25kg brick to failure (1m 30s rest)

Day 2. 

A. The hardest pushing exercise that I can do (right now it is RTO Dips with Rings 90° turned out through out the whole movement) 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B. Elevated Dominik Sky style pike push up 4 sets of 5-8 (3 min rest)

C. Bent Arm Planche progression on Rings 3 sets of 10s-20s (2 min rest)

D. Weighted Dip + heavy band 3 sets of 5-8 (2 min rest)

E. Bodyweight Triceps Extension 3 sets of 10-12 (1m 30s rest)

Then repeat day 1...

Along with these I also train handstand for 20-30 min a day and flexibility + mobility for an hour but different time of the day. Everything combined it takes me about 3 hours a day for a full training.

#4. Nutrition

For hypertrophy or weight gain (and loss) diet is one of the most important factors. However I'm helpless in this situation. I can't afford enough food to get big. I eat what is cooked in home. I don't track my macros or calories. I eat rice twice a day (as lunch and dinner) with curries, a glass of milk, I'm not a vegetarian but I rarely eat meat because it's expensive, I also don't eat fish because it tastes very bad, I eat 1 banana before training right after waking up, 2 eggs, loads of potato and for breakfast or snacks in the evening I eat bread with peanut butter. I also drink sattu which contains a good amount of soy protein (about 20g in 100g/2 glass). I have only gained about 10lbs this year which speaks volume about my diet however there is nothing I can do about that.

#6. About me

If you are still reading this (wow lol) and if you are curious about how I got into that low weight in the first place, here's a brief history of me. When I was 9 months old I had a deseas called Steven Johnson's Syndrome (Toxic Epidermal Nacrolysis stage). It's a very rare (like one in a million in US) and severe deseas (Google for more info). I didn't die but I had permanent damage to my eyes. I'm visually impaired, have photophobia/light sensitivity (that's why I used to sleep at daytime) and dry eyes. I was in a blind boys hostel from the age of 6-12 where I didn't eat enough. My weight was very low. I used to poop like once in 2 weeks. Not to mention I incredibly weak I was. My parents got separated when I was like 10 and I stayed with my mom. I started working out not to be jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. 

And I'm totally aware of the fact that my progress is very slow, objectly it's very bad. I'm almost 2 years into it what do I have to show for it, freaking elbow lever? I can't even do a handstand or a muscle up which is nothing short of embarrassment at this point. I want to be very good at what I do, and clearly I'm showing no signs to indicate that. If I keep training hopefully this year will be better and I may have something better to show for next January. Thanks for reading this long ass post lmao"

"What inspired you to begin working out? I’m wondering what the inspiration for you to start your fitness journey was. I’m sure many people here are dealing with the setbacks that I deal with. Not sure if this matters but I’m Male, 5’10” about 125lbs and 25 years old. 

I’m not overweight or so I don’t look super unhealthy (not saying overweight people do but that’s what drives a lot of people during their fitness journey). I do get comments how I’m skinny but it’s usually from family that haven’t seen me for awhile. 

That being said, I look in the mirror and I’m not happy with what I see but I’m not inspired enough to make a change. I don’t know why. I would like to be bigger but don’t have that motivation to start. 

Thing is I wouldn’t even say I’m lazy. I just would rather use that time doing other stuff, like studying the market, learning skills, cleaning etc. Now I’m making excuses telling myself “you don’t actually value working out, so why would you waste your time?” I’m not sure if that’s true or not from a self awareness perspective or if I’m just lying to myself to make myself feel better. 

Well, my rants over and I understand if people aren’t able to help me, but any information on what inspires you or any advice will be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you."
"A tip for anyone who is struggling to eat enough food in a day. Start early, finish late. 
 

I used to try and eat my calories when I could be bothered to get out of bed (9:30/10) and have my last meal about 7.30pm. 

I realised a while a go that if I got up at 7.30 for my first meal and had my last one about 2030/2100 it’s so much easier to get those extra calories in. 

It’s made a big difference for me"
"New lifter... Struggling to finish my workouts although they aren't (i dont think) crazy, will this normal out as I get more use to the routine? Hi all,

So im currently a noob lifter and have been working out on a 4 day split,

- Monday and Thursday
 - flat barbell press 4 x 10
 - deadlifts 5 x 10
 - Overhead press 5 x 10
 - Incline dumbell press 4 x 10
 - dips 4 or 5 x 5 to 10


Tuesday and Friday
 - pull ups or Lat pull down 5 x 10
 - Squats 5 x 10
 - Dumbell seated rows 5 x 10
 - Seated reverse fly 5 x 10
 - Bicep Curl 5 x 10

So this is my 4 day plan... I keep track of my weight and keep them at a range of around 1 maybe 2 from failure. 

The biggest issue I have is that unless i take long breaks by the time I reach the 5th exercise Im pretty rooted and have been finidng that the exercise is super lack luster... 

Last few weeks Ive been cutting the 5th out all together as im pretty flat. 

Im wondering if this is because im new? Starting lifting with my brother (not super structured around 6 months ago) And my body will adjust as I do it more? 

My weekly sets arent crazy high for anything, chest is top with 16 total but that's within the 10 to 20 range i keep hearing.

I posted in thr r/loseit sub and the response i got was to check sleep and diet.

Sleep i aim for 8 hours but get closer to 7. (Rogan and Mathew walker set me on a straight and narrow path on that)

Im currently in a 500 cal deficit, 500 seems to be the amount that most recommend so not sure if this is the problem."
"Two Years of Electrical Work &amp; Therapy | 122lb-152lb First off if you’re impatient here’s the [pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/245FDYa)

I’ve lurked this subreddit for years and up until about two and a half years ago, I honestly never thought I could bring myself to finally get up to a healthy weight. 

I’m gonna preface this by saying I’ve struggled with body dysmorphia a lot in the past, partly due to my autism and partly due to being called skinny my entire life. HOWEVER, I’ve been relentlessly working on my self-respect and my mental health in general, so it’s leveled out a lot for me.

I should also say, this isn’t a super dramatic transformation and I’m well aware. As I’ll talk about later, I honestly didn’t even set out with gaining weight as a goal until recently, so most of this is just the consequence of living better, not getting fucked up all the time, and eating (a little) better. YMMV. Anyway-

As with so many of you guys, I thought the whole time that it was just my metabolism, and that things would never get better. Well today, I got a memory on my phone of an old shirtless picture. I swear to god y’all my jaw almost hit the floor. I didn’t remember being THAT skinny. So I took another picture of myself today to compare, and that really helped me check my dysmorphia. I have so much trouble actually understanding how I look to other people, but when I saw the pictures back to back it just hit me like a ton of bricks how much healthier I am these days. 

If I’m being real, I didn’t do much to change my weight (at least from a training standpoint). I started doing calisthenics about a year ago and before that I took a job doing electrical work. I’ve also been incredibly lucky to find a partner that loves cooking and eating healthy, and she’s been really helping teach me better habits on that end. After seeing those pictures side by side though, I’ve decided to go all in. I want to feel my best and be as healthy as I possibly can be. 

Anyway, thanks for reading my dumb rant. I love y’all, if you’re a skinny dude like me I’m sure you’ve heard it a million times at this point but you really can gain that weight and be healthy. Have a wonderful day y’all :)"
"A tip for those who are new to gaining The advice in this post is by no means groundbreaking, but I thought it might be helpful for newcomers to the sub who are self-proclaimed ectomorphs/hardgainers and are struggling to put on weight.  

In the morning, in addition to your normal breakfast you're going to make a high-calorie protein/mass-gaining shake.  I'd say aim for \~1000 calories in it (this can vary depending on your calorie needs), and use whole foods, i.e don't drink some store-bought massgainer filled with sugar and other crap. I'm not going to dump a recipe in this post because there are plenty of different shakes to be found by searching on this subreddit or elsewhere.  However, I do have my own recipe that's worked very well for me so if people want to know what it is I'd be happy to share in the comments.  

Again, this isn't a replacement for your normal breakfast or another meal.  Instead, you're going to drink this throughout the day, in between meals or during meals, whenever, as long as you get it down.  This is even easier to do now since many people are still working/taking classes from home.  If you are out of the house for a while during the day, get one of those big hydroflask etc. bottles that will keep it from getting gross and drink it throughout the day.  You can drink it in one sitting if you prefer, but I sometimes feel too sick after doing that.  

This was a game-changer for me the first time I was serious about gaining weight in college a few years ago.  It's much easier to consume/digest a shake than adding an extra big plate of chicken/spinach/rice, and you can get even more calories anyway.  If you spread out your consumption throughout the day you barely notice how much extra food you're getting on top of your normal 3-4 meals.  

Some of you new guys may have already started doing this, and if so props to you because you're on the right path.  Also, this is definitely not something you must do.  You don't need any liquid calories to gain, but if you feel like you're already eating as much as you can, then add this to your diet and I guarantee you will see results.  

Happy gaining!"
"Gained 40lbs 1 year on PPL- what's the next step? Here are my stats before I begin:

Age: 26

Height: 6' 1"" (185 cm)

Weight: 145lbs -&gt; 185lbs (Yes, I was so skinny, my ribs were showing)

I've been weight lifting for about a year, (minus a few weeks due to injuries) and I've been using the famous Reddit PPL ([http://archive.is/gMUfM](http://archive.is/gMUfM)) and have seen significant gains from that. I don't see linear progression anymore and find it hard to add weight every session now. What is the logical next step? I wouldn't consider myself advanced enough to write my own workout program and I really enjoy the PPL. Are there any modifications I can make to the PPL or should I move onto a different program? 

I'm not really seeing any gains after the 185lb mark, been here for a while now. I may have to increase my calorie/protein intake but any other tips for plateauing? I've also been working out at home because of the pandemic, I have the basics like dbs, bbs, and a bench but I don't have any fancy equipment. 

Thanks you all so much :)"
"Is it frowned upon for men to work out their glutes in the gym? Logic tells me “obviously not, guys have muscles in their butts so it’s fine to work them out,” but I can’t help but feel like other men are staring at me in the gym for doing hip thrusts. It feels wrong.

I stopped and took a 3 day break. Now back on day 1, after doing pull ups my elbow is getting really tight, even when doing tricep extensions after. 

I’m having trouble describing the feeling. Anyone have any idea on how I could try and troubleshoot this or tips on what this can be described as?

"Please help. Im new to all this and have been told 2 conflicting eating goals Hi. Ive recently decided to better myself over the las few months. I got a trainer and they set up what machines for me to use, the weights,etc. They also told me that i only  need to eat 90grams of protein a day to build muscle. I did that for awhile and for a few months didnt see any gains. I got another trainer because i wanted to split my days into arms and legs, with abs on both. This trainer is telling me that i need to 187grams of protein to eat a day. They both took my weight and height(83kgs,175cm) and are telling me different things. Ive asked the first trainer again and he's adamant on only needing 90grams. The second trainer thinks he's an idiot. I feel like the second trainers right, but i was struggling to eat 90grams a day(im poor and dont eat alot) so i cant even imagine eating double what im already eating daily.  I'd usually trust these people as they're professionals, but they both work at the same place and are telling me vastly different things. Any help is appreciated!"

"Question about workout intensity. Wondering if you guys feel exhausted after working out? Personally lifting doesn’t really tire me out. I do a 4 day U/L split (Fierce 5 Intermediate). I follow the program progression of adding weight to the compound lifts every 2 weeks. I try to pick weights for my sets so that on my last rep of my last set, I wouldn’t physically be able to complete another rep with good form. So I’m going almost to failure, but I never feel “tired”. I breathe kinda hard after a heavy 5 rep set of DL or squat but even that goes away after 30 seconds, and I haven’t been sore since the first week of the program. I never feel tired after accessory work, I just feel a small pump in the isolated muscle that goes away after a few minutes. I wait 3 minutes between compound lifts and 90 seconds between accessory sets. Am I doing something wrong, should I increase my intensity?"

Thanks."
"GOMAD long term Mythical Strength recently made a post talking about GOMAD and pushed me to make a post sharing my experiences, as I've been doing it since 2018 (with a 10 month break because I stopped training). [Here is his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/kug8ma/the_gallon_of_milk_a_day_gomad_doing_it_right). He specifically stated GOMAD is not sustainable and I'm going to go over why that's wrong. I'll include some tips that winners do as well.

Disclaimer: You don't do this for health reasons, I am in no way advocating you should drink a gallon of milk every day to get more vitamin D. You do it because of the calories, macros, price, and most of all it's so fucking easy. If you can tolerate milk and have trouble gaining weight then I have no sympathy for you. Also I'd like to point out that my opinion doesn't matter, but I'm gonna give it to you anyway.

I'm 6'3, before I started lifting I weighed 165lbs. My peak is 240lbs. I took a long break from lifting and dropped down to 170ish by the time I returned, which was this past August. I am now back to 230 with most of my strength back. I don't know why I feel compelled to say this, but if your activity level goes way down, stop drinking so much milk.

Always whole milk, anything else and you're just pulling your pud. Also, put the empty pints away, drink it straight from the jug or you'll spend all day pouring and doing dishes. 

Much like training, you don't start out pounding a gallon of milk in one sitting. That is one of my goals, but I always chicken out after a half gallon. I started out at 3 gallons a week, and I wasn't even trying to do GOMAD, it was just how much milk I drank. I jumped to 4 very quickly after that and that's when I realized how little effort it took to gain weight versus actually having to chew so much damn food. From there it just felt intuitive and I drank it like water. If you want to reach a gallon a day, progressively overload your milk intake, you will hardly notice it once you have achieved a gallon a day/enlightenment. When you are drinking that much milk, drinking it is refreshing. If I ever get nausea, milk is the first thing I reach for. When I use to go to commercial gyms, I would bring a big ass thermos that held about a quarter gallon of milk with me and drink it between sets.

Maintaining for the long term works great assuming you don't develop some sensitivity towards lactate. Here are three questions people ask me when they find out I drink a lot of milk:

**Won't that make you really fat?**- It can if you don't use your body for anything. 

**Isn't that really unhealthy?**- It's probably not the healthiest thing you could be doing, but it's not as bad as you might think. I've had plenty of checkups with my doctor and blood tests. The only thing that was abnormal in my blood tests is creatinine levels, which are elevated because that's what they do when you exercise. Also, there are people that drink soda everyday and I rarely feel the need to ever drink any because I slam so much milk.

**Doesn't that get crazy expensive?**- No. Think of all of the other things you don't have to buy because so much of your intake is coming from milk, then compare how much that costs to milk. It's pretty damn efficient moneywise. You don't need to buy whey either, protein powder is just derivatives of milk anyway so it's redundant. 

I'm closing, GOMAD isn't a meme. Weighing less than 200lbs as an adult male is, and maxing out your bodyweight squat/deadlift while taking 3 different supplements + mass gainer then complaining about being skinny is. Adding raw weight to your body and lifts isn't.  It is sustainable and will probably make your life easier, as a big chunk of your macros and calories are predetermined. In fact, it's really well suited as a long term approach. It works, and it works a lot better if you're working hard enough to warrant it."

I have really improved my pull up numbers and I'm far stronger than I was, but I have not seen any visual change until very recently.

"Am I gaining too slow, or am I eating less than I should? Hi all! I am 32, 170cm (~5ft 7"") 70kg (~154b)

Two months ago, after losing enough body fat, I started a bulking phase (for the first time in my life). As I read everywhere, I started increasing bit by bit my caloric intake, however I kept losing weight, so I ended up reaching 3000 calorie/day, and now I am finally gaining weight.

However, according to my scale (which, although not very precise, is quite consistent), the rate at which I am gaining seems, at least to me, quite slow.

When I started the bulking, I was around 68kg (~150lb). After two months (the first one I was adjusting the caloric intake, and then Christmas came...), while in an upper/lower workout routine for 4 days a week + some cardio after upper training + 1 specific cardio day, I am at 70kg (~154lb). According to the scale, I gained approximately 1kg of muscle, and 2 points of bf percentage.

My caloric intake atm is approximately 3000 calories, divided in 100 fat / 350 carbs / 180 protein (dancing a bit around those numbers).

So, hence my question: should I be gaining faster? Or is it okay like this?"
"A Reflection on 10 Weeks of Bulking About 10 weeks ago, I began my process of bulking. In that 10 weeks time, I put on approximately 6 pounds. I still have a long ways to go, but I’ve enjoyed my time in this sub, thanks for everyone who has helped! I know none of this stuff is revolutionary, and I am not as good of a writer as some poster on here, but this is what I would have told myself 10 weeks ago:

-Don’t go “all in” right away. I think this is a common mistake, I realized I really needed to put on weight, got a little scared, and ended up eating the most food I had had in a single sitting. I felt like crap for the next 2 days. I felt full for these days and in turn, probably ended up eating less.

-I was eating a lot less than I thought I was. Again, I think this is pretty common, I thought I was eating a lot, but when you don’t eat for 6,7,8 hours after breakfast, it’s almost impossible to get in enough calories. 

-I feel so much better, in almost all aspects of life. I no longer feel tired all the time, I’m getting better sleep, and despite it being counterintuitive, I am literally running faster than I ever have in my life. I was hesitant to “bulk” as a distance runner, because a low body weight is so emphasized in the sport. But too little is probably worse than too much, I look forward to running so much more, and have a new love for the sport. 

-I don’t care if I put on a bit of fat. I definitely had some body image issues going on, and thought I wouldn’t like how I looked bigger, it’s the complete opposite. I look more full, and yes I have some fat, but that’s honestly for the better in my case. 

-I’m weak as hell. This is more of a goal looking to the future, as I have made major progress, but still can’t really lift to save my life. I’ve been running Westside for Skinny Bastards, and seriously enjoyed it. 

In the end, I may not have put on as much weight or even as much muscle as I probably could have. I missed meals, messed up workouts and so on. But I'm doing what makes me feel the best and be the happiest and don’t regret any of it. I feel so much better than I did beforehand, and plan on only getting stronger and better. If anyone has questions I am happy to answer. Thanks again gainers for all your posts, they’ve really inspired me"
"Is doing heavy squats and deadlift 2x a week too much? I run a PPL split with heavy deadlifts on my pull day and heavy squats on leg day both twice a week. Wondering if I’m setting myself up for wear and tear with the frequency of low rep compound lifting days (4x a week). Would an alternative of going heavy for low reps on one session (5 reps) and lighter more controlled reps closer to failure (8-12 reps) on the next session be more ideal for preventing injury and not running my body down in the long term?

edit: important detail is that I’m cutting rn and have been eating in a deficit for just about 2 months now which is why I’m unsure if my body can’t handle that with the reduced calories"
how to improve cardio specifically for high reps on compound lifts when i do high reps(specially pullups) i tend to feel my cardio gives out before my  muscles. How do i improve my cardio or lung capacity to do more reps?
"Metallicadpa PPL AMRAP every time? So I have been doing this routine for about 3 months now. Each day has a compound lift that ends with AMRAP. As a beginner, is it ok to be pushing this absolutely until failure everytime? Even if your form starts to lack? I know the original routine says only as many as you can do with good form, but I've been seeing posts and comments here stating that it doesn't matter. Things like ""if you want to be big ya gotta push it every time"", ""beginners don't know what failure really is"", ""people are poor judges of how many reps they actually have left in them"". Until the bar has to be dropped on the safety catches? I feel like that will hinder your performance the next time? Is it just not heavy enough weight for a beginner and going to failure only once in a while is an intermediate-advanced lifter thing?"
"Calisthenics and Cardio? Hey guys! So I’ve been lifting for about a couple months and I was just wondering the volume at which I should be doing calisthenics movements (specifically pushups) and how often and type of cardio while running a push/pull/legs program?

Edit: To add some more info, my goals are muscle gain for aesthetic purposes primarily, i’m 128 lbs 5’8” and im at about 18 percent body fat"
"How important is protein on calorie surplus? I know nowadays the high protein lifestyle is all the hype in the fitness industry, but i mean for real i can get around the idea that we need a big protein percentage during a cut to preserve mass.

But what about a bulk? How important is big protein percentage, i mean it's not like a waste of resources and money to eat say 200 g per day on a bulk? Yeah it will lead to increased mass, but how relevant is that to a more mediocre protein consumption say 100g per day? Less than half gains?

I don't mean to to rant or something i just wanna really know how it works in a bulk, how all the vegetarians people who barely get 50g / day bulk or sustain mass.

Or it's just a way of marketing the big whey protein powder pharma  to sell more powder?

Any relative input is appreciated guys."
"How to follow a weight gain diet, when SO is trying to lose weight Hello everyone, I [f/23] am new to all of this and after going through the FAQ page, I am really set in mind to start this weight gaining journey, in hopes that I achieve my dream body before our wedding (in 9 months)
Now my only issue right now is with my fiance, I am the cook in our relationship and I basically pick what meals we eat, when we eat them, etc. As I am a very picky eater while he is pretty chill with everything and can eat anything anytime. He is trying to lose weight though, nothing hardcore, but he's trying to atleast NOT gain weight. His diet is mainly cutting out most of the carbs, so rice, bread, pasta etc. and replacing it with other alternatives like cauliflower rice, Zucchini pasta, protein bread and so on. 

So what I used to do so far when cooking meals for us, was that I cooked the protein (meat) by itself, and then made some rice/pasta for me, and another carb-free alternative for him.
But now looking at the type of food I would have to eat to gain weight, I feel like I wouldnt always be able to provide an alternative for him for the same meal, and instead cook something completely different, which is just is too much work especially since my daily meals would increase as well.

Anyone is/was in the same boat as me? How can I add a new diet for me to follow without affecting his diet significantly? Is there a way maybe to meal prep somehow so that it would be less work? I have tried searching about that but everything was mostly for losing weight."

"Feeling a bit drowsy/tired since starting my bulk any reason why? Lately I’ve been feeling pretty tired late in the day and in the mornings, much more so than normal, this first started about a month into my bulk and has gone on for about 2 weeks, I’ve been eating around 300-500 calories surplus the best I can. Am I simply tired from my body digesting all the food?"
"Should I even bother going to the gym on days I completely fail to eat enough? Some people eat when they are stressed, but I've always been the opposite...stress makes me feel sick to my stomach and I just avoid eating.

Due to being on vacation for a few weeks from mid Dec-Jan I was able to start off the year pretty strong as far as upping my calorie intake and hitting the gym daily.  I was hoping to carry this momentum going forward, but now that my break is over and I'm back at work things are slowly starting to crumble. Long story short the project our team is working on is not going well, we are mere weeks out from a release, and stress is at a all time high. There have been several days when all I can manage to choke down from 8:30am until about 3pm is a banana and some water. I then make dinner around 5:30-6, this is always consistent because by this time I actually have an appetite.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I feel like a complete failure on these days and I feel like shit, but I still drag myself to the gym. I'm working on managing my stress levels, but in the mean time is it even worth going to workout if I'm not eating enough during the day? Am I doing more harm than good?"
"Protein Powder for Beginner (Serious MASS) So i'm taking Serious Mass protein powder for the last 3 days trying to gain weight. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing with the measurement and everything.

Based on the label from serious mass: 2 heaping scoop = **336g** and for beginner, 1 heaping scoop = means **168g**.

I can't mix the 168g of powder in my smoothie because my blender won't take it. So I decided to divide it into 3 drinking (**56g\*3**) breakfast, Afternoon, &amp; Evening. 

Am I doing the right thing? Thanks for your help!"
"Is gaining a bit of belly fat expected when bulking? So I've been going to the gym for the past few months, doing the 6 day reddit PPL. I've seen great success in terms of strength and size  pretty much everywhere (arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs). One thing I've noticed though is I have a small bump on the lower part of my stomach and I'm getting kinda worried I'm gaining too fast. I roughly gain 0.5-0.7kg each week which I've heard is ideal when bulking. The rest of my body doesn't look so ""fat"". Anyone have some insight? Thanks"
"Is my lack of following a program the reason why I look like crap? I've been lifting seriously for around 3-4 years.

I weigh 78kg or 173lbs and am around 16% bodyfat @ 5ft 8/173cm/1.72 m

My nutrition is great and I always hit my macros.


I usually train one body part a day and always push myself very hard. I don't really reserve energy and go to failure in all my working set. 

Monday: Chest
Always start with heavy dumbell press 5 sets of 5 reps, 4 sets of failure for upper and lower chest on incline dumbell press, 5 sets of cable or dumbell flys

Tuesday: Biceps
15 minutes of light weight, trying to activate my bicep and get good mind muscle connection (biceps are terrible)
Usually superset weighted pullups into seated bicep curls and then a burn out with lower weight. I repeat these 3 exercises 4 times with around a minute and a half rest time between

Wednesday: Back
Back really isn't an issue for me as I have decent genetics for it. Seated row machine for 5 sets of failure reps into 4 sets of bent over rows, and then 4 sets of rack pulls to failure

Thursday: Shoulders
Shoulders are similar to my back, where I have decent genetics. I usually start with something like a seated shoulder press doing 10+ reps to failure for 4 sets and then doing the same with rear delt flys. I will then usually do a burnout drop set

Friday: Legs
Begin with heavy squats, 5 sets of 5 into 4 sets of 10+ reps to failure on leg press. 4 sets of machine leg extensions to 10+ reps failure and the same with hamstring curls. Then I finish off with calf raises with weight to failure for 8 or so sets. My calves suck...

Saturday: Light cardio 

Sunday: Rest day"
My overhead press wont increase at all. I have been lifting for 3 months and start my push workout with 4x flat then 4x incline dumbbell press for chest. lastly I do 4x overhead press. My chest press has been increasing consistently (flat went from 40lbs to 50lbs for 12 reps) but I have seen barely any improvement in OHP. Right now Im at 27lbs. Is it because of all the chest pressing I do before which is also fatiguing my shoulders? Any advice would be appreciated.
"If you only had dumbbells available... ... And they were a fixed weight - let's say enough for you to max out at 12 bicep curls - what exercises would you do to gain muscle? Assuming that diet was on point.

How would you progress? Would your upper body routine consist more of bodyweight exercises? What about legs? Hill sprints?

"Been lifting for a couple years, weight gain has really slowed down So like most of you when I began training I had no idea what I was doing and what I should be eating. I feel pretty lucky because I actually found this forum and some good YouTube channels quite early on my journey, and I began counting my calories and following a routine, although I couldn’t drive at the time so I did home workouts. I very slowly gained weight, and admittedly a lot of that might have to do with puberty. I went from around 100 to 110/115 very slowly, and then over the summer lost some weight and went back down to 105. I slowly gained back that weight again, and over the past year I’ve gone from 115 to 130/135, but most of that progress was in the first 6 months, and I’ve mostly spun my wheels since then. I’ve tracked my calories the same way and have increased my caloric intake from 2800 to an average of 3100. I’ve always strived to maintain a healthy diet, but at this point I just can’t seem to push myself to eat more, and if I can add just a few hundred calories in easy, unhealthy foods I may be able to push through this plateau. Thoughts?"
"Sorry if this is a dumb question 
I’m wanting to get some lean gains and I don’t have a lot of muscle to show and I’m also 18M.

My question is I initially did a cut and thought that was how I could get rid of this belly fat and maybe face fat so i looked better in the long run.

Well I don’t have that much muscles to cut into so would doing a cut with little muscle do more harm than good? 

For reference I’m a swimmer so I’ve done a lot of cardio in my life"
"Finding it almost impossible to learn how to deadlifts probably I've an embarrassingly low 1 rp maxs, and very underweight mainly because of my ibs but anyway.

I'm trying to learn the right form of deadlifts. Thing is every  youruber are able to deadlift large 45 plate as demonstration and the thing is I can't lift like them. Barely 5kgs or 10kgs which result in making bar way too short to me, so I end up fking my back up and curving my spine .

Their is no bumper plates in my gym nor those steps I can stack on. So virtually impossible for me to progress through deadlifts and get stronger since the form is off.

I tried to do an empty bar stating from top position , but I ended up doing romanian deadlifts except of a deadlift"
Will my gains take a severe hit from missing my surplus a couple days a week? Certain days throughout my week (once or twice) I’ll end up really caught up with work and can’t reach caloric surplus for the day. Usually I meet about maintenance calories or a bit less. Is this a big deal in the long run? Should I start planning/packing meals better? Thanks!
"Skinny ‘Relapse’ Was doing super well this year, up from 134lbs to 158 at my peak (6ft) but when the lockdown hit in December and I had no access to the gym my motivation just completely went, I think I have been a bit depressed and I fell back into my old bad habits (sleeping in late, skipping meals cause of it)

I’ve now dropped down to 144lbs and just feel completely bummed. I’ve lost a bit of strength but not as much as the weight comparatively. I’ve bought some dumbbells now and am going to make sure I get back doing better again.

Does anyone have experience of this? Does the weight come back quicker?"
Is sticking to just dumbbells for chest press and overhead press bad for gains? I like doing dumbbells way more than barbell because its easier for me to push myself without a spotter. Also it has a more natural range of motion and its easier on my wrists. People here often suggest on rotating between dumbbell and barbell but does it really matter all that much? Thanks.
"[Progress] 6'1"" 175lbs-&gt;231lbs - 56 pounds gained over 2.5 years https://imgur.com/a/93sAjgz

From June 2018 to January 2021

Disclosure: I had a little weight training experience from college so some of these gains were ""muscle memory-esque"". Really never looked anything close to impressive in college though, and I feel I hit college level after a month or two of lifting again.

There was one cut between these photographs. It was from 213lbs to 187lbs and I would consider it a failure considering how much muscle/strength I lost.

My routine started as a high volume high intensity ""fucking around"" routine where I focused on mind muscle connection and doing what I wanted. Gained some good size doing that, but lost a bunch from my cut.

I eventually decided to start tracking my lifts and following an actual program and have been doing the following routine for about a year and half: https://rippedbody.com/intermediate-bodybuilding-program/

I modify the program to fit my needs in many ways though. It's more of a skeleton. It has been quite successful for me.

I eat a ton of food, usually only focusing on protein goals. I take creatine and sometimes whey protein. Chicken, rice, canned fish, sweets, fruits, milk, nuts, stews, etc. Gaining weight through the 220s was very slow going and tough.

I hope it doesn't need to be said due to my size and conditioning, but I am very much natty.

**Next Steps?** Cutting. Soon I am going to try again and cut more slowly, keep weights heavy, and add even more protein."

"Advice for teenager not seeing intended gains (i.e. isn't Arnold after one year)  Hey there. I'm 17 and have been going to the gym properly for around about 1 year now. Starting off, I did the whole eat big to get big thing and ended up getting a bit fat so I decided to do a body recomposition after about 6-7 months. I did a decent amount of research on how to do it, however after the first two months the physique didn't really change. The past 3 months have seen some changes, I've lost around 4kg and my body fat went from approx 22% to around 17-18% (according to the scales) and I've put on some muscle. Essentially, I'm a bit leaner and a little bit bigger then before I start working out. Because of the slow progression, I've been debating undergoing a proper cut, getting lean, before beginning to seriously bulk. Some advice on whether or not do this would be greatly appreciated.

Before I forget, I do track my calories as best I can (eating a slight surplus on the days I workout and a deficit on rest days) as well as tracking my progress in the gym. I did start off quite physically inept having embarrassingly low one rep maxes on the main 3, despite this, they've now risen to mind blowing highs of: 75kg for bench, 90kg for squat and 120 for deadlift. My progression in the gym and lack thereof in the physique is my reason for the post, so some wise words would be awesome.

Thanks very much :)

Edit: I greatly appreciate the help and it looks like going to cut down and maintain before bulking. Thanks for the wise words everyone :)"
"Anyone else here eating ENORMOUS amount of calories? (4K+). Please, help. Just wanted to see if anyone else here is a super hard gainer like me. Getting a bit worried. 

I’m 6’2”, 24 years old healthy male. Been training for 4 years or so.

Last year I gained 12 pounds (168-180) after surgery in a matter of 6 months, while slowly increasing my maintenance calories from 3700 to 4100.

Recently, the weight have stalled around 180 pounds, and I had to increase my intake to 4,200 calories.. looks like the scale hasn’t moved at all for the 5 days. 

The problem is - I don’t live a super active lifestyle. A sedentary office job with gym 3 times a week, but the calories I need to eat are higher than many people on this sub. My TDEE should be way lower than this. 

I track everything diligently using Cronometer, averaging exactly what I plan for the day - 4,200.

Should I just accept my ridiculous metabolism and keep increasing calories until the scale starts to move? At what point should I be seeing a doctor? 

My goal by the end of the year is to be 210lbs, so that’s a little less than 4lb for me to gain in a month. I don’t mind some fat, but I can’t imagine how much I’d need to eat to get there. 

I don’t have any tapeworms for reference. Have had colonoscopy last year.

Anyone with a similar story? 

Thanks."

"How to prevent hyperextending of back when squatting? Hey everyone, I’m pretty new to this sub and lifting. I just started hitting the gym again after 9 months and lifting weights and I’ve noticed a problem with my squat. Every time I start to prepare myself before and as I’m squatting towards the ground, my back seems to jut out (https://thebarbellphysio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Squat-Spine-Control.png) Similar to the picture I start out in the position in the left panel and as I go down my posture is similar to the middle panel. Once I’m fully down it still looks similar to the middle panel of the picture. I’m kind of skinny, 6’ 2” and have long legs so I’m not sure whether I just instinctually go into this position to hold my balance or whether it’s just a habit that’s formed while squatting. Anyways is there a way I can effectively fix this? Should I continue squatting or should I be doing some exercises to help control this hyperextending of the back? Also any tall people have tips for how I should position my legs? I seem to really widen my stance and point my toes out so that I don’t lose balance as I go down. Thank you for the help!!

TL;DR What’s the best way to stop hyperextension of the back as I squat? —&gt; https://thebarbellphysio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Squat-Spine-Control.png (my squat basically looks like the left and middle panel of the pic and continues to look like the middle panel as I’m getting as close as I can to the ground)"

"Deadlift/ general progression What's up gainers,

So I've been running the FAQ 6 day PPL program which has me deadlifting once a week. I started with 1 plate and worked up to 195 for 5 reps last week but couldn't even get that weight off the floor this session. I dropped the weight to 185 and banged out 5 reps. I've been hovering around 185-195 for the last 4 weeks. I did feel my back rounding last week so I think it might be a form issue.

I've had a similar issue with my squat and my hypertrophy bench, and many accessory lifts My 5x5 bench progression seems to be going alright.

I'm 6' ~136 lbs. I started at 130 lb in the beginning of November. I've been eating 3000-3200 cals a day

Thanks"
Alternative solutions For...reasons I cannot get into here I’ve been told to stay away from the major compound lifts squats deadlifts and bench press. Does anybody have any recommendations on the best alternative without these? I’m thinking something that incorporates pull-ups and dips is probably best.
"When should water weight/glycogen stores start to level off? In my first week, I gained about 1.8 lbs. Did my second weekly weigh in of my bulk (both in the morning before consuming anything and after emptying my system) and gained another 3.3 lbs. So two weeks, about 5 lbs total. In my mind, I had anticipated water weight and stores being filled up in like one week. I came off a 4 month cut, eating ~1750 to a lean bulk, eating ~2450 calores. I’m aiming for gaining half a pound a week, now that its been two weeks, can I now expect to gain 0.5 lbs a week given I follow my calories? I have been slow loading creatine for almost a month now and my sodium levels could be better, but I dont think they really changed too much compared to my cut. Thanks for any feedback even if its “i dont know man”"
"The Gallon of Milk A Day (GOMAD): Doing It ""Right"" Howdy Gainers,

**INTRO**

The infamous ""GOMAD"" approach to gaining weight has been around for about a hundred years now, with pioneers such as Milo Steinborn and Joseph Curtis (JC) Hise leading the charge on it in it's infancy and other great men of strength such as Paul Anderson and Doug Hepburn continuing it's momentum.  It's been written about by authors such as John McCallum and Randall Strossen, and even advocated by more modern types such as Chase Karnes and Matt Reynolds.  HOWEVER, as is often the case with great ideas, the telephone game (I'm dating myself there I'm such: do kids call it the textmessage game now?) has been in effect, and much of the truth behind this method has been lost.  I figure it's worth having a discussion on the subject.


**MY BACKGROUND/EXPERIENCE**

I did the gallon of milk a day approach to gaining back in 2006, while I was in college and on a meal plan, which definitely made things easier.  I paired it with the ""Super Squats"" program, as that is where the idea was heavily emphasized.  You can read about that program [here](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Super+Squats&amp;qid=1610290584&amp;sr=8-1).

In the 6 weeks I drank the gallon of milk a day and ran the program, I also ate a diet that consisted of a LOT of food, and ended up putting on 12lbs in 6 weeks.  I drank 2% milk, as we did not have whole milk in our dinning hall.

Prior to drinking a gallon of milk a day, I had legit not had milk as a beverage since my childhood.   This required a re-acclimation to milk, which I will discuss momentarily.

**WHAT GOMAD IS NOT**

* Healthy.  Understand that from the forefront.  That's not the point of it.  If your goal is maximal health, you should NOT be drinking a gallon of milk a day.  

* Sustainable.  This is a blitz approach, paired with extreme training, to get extreme results.  You won't be doing this for life.  6 weeks was right for me.  Some folks run it for longer. 

* A first resort.  A lot of trainees want to jump onto GOMAD right away, but this is something that's done AFTER you have real nutrition sorted out.  If you're living off weight gain shakes and don't know how to boil water, do NOT do GOMAD.  Learn to cook.  [Try here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ijjm9h/bachelor_bulking_quit_making_shakes_learn_how_to/)

**WHAT GOMAD IS**

* A way to get in an extra 2000+ calories a day with a ton of protein on TOP of a already heavy diet.  The reason milk is advocated is because liquid tends to ""fill in the cracks"" left behind when you have a full stomach.  Basically, you always have room for milk, so while you're mainlining solid calories you can use the milk to get in even MORE restorative calories to recover from VERY intense training.  And that's the thing: don't just drink a gallon of milk a day and run Starting Strength.  You need to be training hard enough that you NEED all those extra calories.

* A last resort.  Maybe not THE last resort, but things should definitely be squared away on the rest of the nutritional front BEFORE you do this.  A gallon of milk a day on top of a terrible diet is going to mean terrible results.

**MISTAKES PEOPLE MAKE**

* If you are like me and NOT a regular milk drinker, do NOT just jump into a gallon of milk a day overnight.  Super Squats and Brawn both talk about how one needs to ease into milk consumption.  I started off by drinking a glass of milk at night before bed for a week.  It was a great way to get in a few extra calories before sleeping, and helped get my gut used to milk while I was too busy being unconscious to feel it's effects.  I then started working a glass of milk into one of my meals of the day on top of the glass before bed.  Eventually all meals had a glass of milk with them, and then I was ready to fully commit to the process.

* On the above, I don't discount that people ARE lactose intolerant, but I also imagine some folks are just not accustomed to drinking milk, and easing into the process will help redevelop that tolerance.  If you ARE lactose intolerant, this is, of course, a terrible idea, and you should not do it.

* Drinking the milk too quickly.  Don't try to get your gallon knocked out so it's ""out of the way"": drink it over the course of the day.  You'll feel much better.

**IF I DID IT AGAIN**

I'd go with something like fairlife or raw milk personally.  As I get older, I'm trying to put better things in my body.  But for a broke college kid, ""free"" milk was awesome.

As always, would be happy to entertain any questions or comments.  For those that have done GOMAD, share your experiences as well!"

"I can't put weigh ( help) Hi i am 26 years old and my weigh is 144lbs.
I am currently bulking with 3000 calories on training days and i eat 2000 kcal on rest days.
I go to the gym 4-5 days per week and the problem is i cant put weigh and i feel like 3000 kcal is way too much food for me and sometimes i force myself to eat.
It should be enough calories to put a decent amount of weigh but i cant see any changes and i'm not a very active person.
What should i do?"
"Has anyone done vegetable based diet for bulking? I just read ""How Not to Die""* (written by same guy behind nutrition facts.ort) and it has inspired me to move away from the 2 lbs of chicken per day. In first week, I've noticed tons of improvement in how I feel (more energy, less depression, also my eczema has disappeared). Yet I'm afraid of losing muscle mass. I'm not completely giving up meat. Just curtailing.

"How to movie forward with my strength progression *if this is not the sub for this I will be more than willing to remove and re post to somewhere like r/weightroom *


Hey everyone, I wanted to ask you guys what are some realistic strength goals to set for the new year, and what may be good programs or programming ideas to achieve these goals 

Here [https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/workouts/stevedensitystrength.pdf ] is my current program, I’m on week 14 of 16, and I really like it, and I’ve been making good progress (+5 pounds every week on all my barbell lifts) 

I’ve attached my current estimated ORM’s (estimates by symmetric strength, I’ve also included the lifts I imputed to calculate those maxes, or in some cases estimates done by me), it’s important to note before running my current program I did all stupid self programming and really only wanted to gain strength in weights Dio’s and chins ups, so I have terrible strength imbalances. I didn’t even start OHPing until about may of 2020. I was a big idiot. Some imbalances are also because I train from home and have limited equipment so I was not or currently am not able to train certain movements. 

I am 18, 5’10 and weigh 210lbs, I first started working out with basic calisthenics almost 3 years ago, my estimated maxes are 

Bench: 260-270 (225-230X5-6)
OHP 180 (165X3)
Deadlift:315X6-8
Barbell Hack squat (don’t have a squat rack) 315X6-8
Weighted dip +135X8-10 
Weighted chin up: +90X3-5
Cheat row:255X8-9

*if it changes anything, I do my OHP from my bench by putting the pegs at the highest slot, and then turning and facing the wall while seated, but no back support. 

*DIps and chins numbers were from lifts from when I was a little lighter, though I’m fairly certain as I’ve gained weight I’ve kept the same weight added. 



I really look forward to getting stronger, I’d like to build up my bench, OHP, and deadlift a lot, but I also would like to continue in strengthening my Dips and Chins.

"Esophagus/GERD issues have killed my appetite It's been a gradual problem over the past few months now, and it got worse when I started bulking 2 weeks ago, and I'm getting an endoscopy done in a couple weeks. 

My doctor really gave me no advice about what to eat and whatnot, he just told me to take some Prilosec and see how it goes after 14 days. He said I could still eat whatever I wanted as long as I drink water and chew slowly. I've given up on bread and heavy stuff because it's just adds on to the problem.

Should I stop bulking for the time-being and work on healing this problem? Or would I still be able to bulk? I've read about the foods to eat/not to eat but just wanted to get some thoughts for the sub."

"FEED CONVERSION RATIO: A Simple Fact of Gaining https://oatsandwheytoday.blogspot.com/2021/01/feed-conversion-ratio-simple-fact-of.html

What is the FEED CONVERSION RATIO, and does it have any relevance to hard-gainers? Yes, so tuck in for a long read. You need to know that foods you eat are not 100% utilized. You do not digest everything you eat. Some of the calories you eat slip out the other end. **Digestion is never 100% efficient.** How can we know this? Well, pardon the ""yuck""-factor, but if you've ever seen corn or peas in your stool, you know it. If lactose makes you gassy, that attests to this. The very fact that 30% of nuts you eat are eliminated, if not well-chewed, is also proof of this. THIS is why I often say, ""You're not a hard-gainer, you're a hard-digester"". This is often the result of mal-absorption.

**See, it's not how much you can eat, it's how much you can digest.** And some people are just ""not as good"" at digestion. This isn't your ""metabolism"", this is poor food utilization. Additional factors contribute to our ability to process the foods we eat. Food calories can be lost in other ways, to other physiological processes. But we want to maximize the conversion of our calories into weight gain, correct? This is why I wanted to take a moment to have a closer look at this concept of Feed Conversion Ratio. Where does this ratio come from? And does it have any relevance to a hardgainer simply trying to put on good weight?

This Feed Conversion Ratio comes from the livestock industry. These are the folks who fatten up pigs and cattle, to get them to market. These are the people who are highly invested in getting their animals quickly to a certain weight. The animal's gains are literally the farmer's profits. And it would be ideal if each pound of feed produced a pound of meat. But it's nowhere close to this number! The ratio averages 3:1 in the example of a pig. It takes roughly 3 pounds of feed to yield 1 pound of weight. As an example, you might feed 665 pounds of feed to a pig in the weeks it weighs between 40 pounds and 280 pounds. You would calculate the ratio as ""665 pounds of feed divided by 240 pounds of weight gain for a score of 2.77"". You could thus say ""the Feed Conversion Ratio is 2.77:1"" in this instance.

Now, every animal has a different score for feeding efficiency. For beef cattle, FCR calculated on live weight gain of 4.5–7.5 was in the normal range with an FCR above 6 being typical. Some data for sheep illustrate variations in FCR. An FCR (kg feed dry matter intake per kg live mass gain) for lambs is often in the range of about 4 to 5 on high-concentrate rations. As of 2011 in the US, broiler chickens has an FCR of 1.6 based on body weight gain, and mature in 39 days. A lower first number in the ratio is desirable, as less feed is required to yield the same amount of meat.

If it requires 6 pounds of feed to make each pound of beef, versus 3 pounds of feed to produce a pound of pork, versus only 1.6 pounds of feed to grow a pound of chicken, then it's obvious that chicken is more economic in the simple sense that you spend less on animal food to grow the animal for market sale. But even on a species-by-species basis, there is variance within the species breed-by-breed. Sure, the average for a pig is 3:1. But some breeds of pigs might require 3.5 pounds of feed, on average, to gain a pound of weight, while another breed of pig only needs 2.6 pounds of feed to gain that same pound of pork. The latter breed gains weight &amp; muscle with less food.

By this logic, we must extrapolate a conclusion that even among human people, there is not an equal ability to convert food into weight with an identical efficiency. We cannot assume that everyone responds to food (calories) in an identical manner. Is this due to ""metabolism""? Largely, NO. Studies in metabolic wards have confirmed that although some people do have higher basal metabolic rates (resting metabolism), the effect is very slight. It's on the order of about 150-200 calories. Of people with identical height, weight, and body composition, one person might burn 150 more calories in a day. That's really not a lot. So what's going on with hardgainers who swear up &amp; down that they're eating so much more than everyone else? Is this really happening?

First, can we even find a Feed Conversion Ratio for humans? It doubtlessly exists. But that would be beyond the scope of this article. Moreover, it would be highly impractical as well as unethical. For starters, we aren't eating an iso-caloric pelletized food kibble for all of our food intake needs. We also aren't looking at basic-rate growth from infancy-to-adulthood based on per-pound of feed; we're looking in the particular context of weight gain in response to resistance-training hypertrophy. But we don't need to know a rate of efficiency. It's enough to know that the absorption &amp; assimilation of food is variable. And it's affected by other variables, besides enzymatic digestion.

Environment and Temperature can have a big effect on appetite. A pig’s environment can affect its food consumption and conversion. The ambient temperature of the pen must be kept in the thermo-neutral range or it will have a negative influence on a pig’s appetite. Pigs that are cold will eat more feed. Pigs that are hot will eat less. High humidity can also reduce appetite, as can poor ventilation. As a human goes, I can personally attest that I don't want to eat as much when it's too warm, or too stuffy. If ""poor appetite"" is a complaint of yours, this could be one explanation: Your environment is simply too warm for you to get the signal to eat for warmth! A meal should make you warm, due in part to the thermic effect of food. Digesting food requires your body to ramp up, and if you're already warm, hunger may be blunted or muted altogether. And conversely, if it's far too cold, animals will eat more, but also burn more, for heat. Some calories will be lost to heat, when they could have been used for growth.

Are we pigs in a pen being raised for food? Certainly not. But is it unreasonable to assume ambient temperatures play a factor in appetite, as well as metabolism, in the human? Burning body fat for heat is an element of ""calories out"", and it's the largest component of non-exercise energy expenditure. Are you guilty of insisting on wearing a T-shirt in the house during Winter, instead of bundling up a little bit indoors? Not-eating when too warm can impair appetite some of the time, coupled with over-burning when exposed to cooler temperatures and needlessly burning calories for heat another part of the time, can both contribute to impaired weight gain for two different reasons.

Animal Stress also factors into appetite strength. If the density of pigs in the pen is too high, they will experience stress which results in eating less. I'm aware that only so many extrapolations can be made from our pig-farming corollary here, but this also bears legitimacy: People, too, often eat less in times of stress (some are known to eat more, but that's not our demographic). Common stress can play a big role in appetite impairment. So it goes without saying, you might be experiencing stressors in your life, even if unbeknownst to you. Making time to relax before eating a meal might help unlock some of that. A simple 10-minute walk to clear your head and get some fresh air can work wonders in giving your appetite the boost it needs. Mindfulness &amp; meditation may also promote de-stressing.

To shift back to another topic, there is also an effect that results in poor food utilization, which I call the ""Novel Meal Phenomenon"". This is the result of an excessively varied diet, to which the body does not have sufficient time to adapt. This is something you can observe if you've ever had a dog: They acclimatize to their particular brand of dog food and this produces a firm healthy stool. But if you switch food brands suddenly, they'll typically have loose stools for the next couple of days while they adjust to the different macro composition and nutritional profile of the food. This is why it is recommended to mix a little of the new food with the food the dog is already accustomed to, in order to gradually transition the dog to the new food over a couple of weeks, rather than switching all at once. This gives your canine companion some time to re-calibrate its own production of digestive enzymes.

When you are exposed to many of the same foods on a regular basis, your body starts to anticipate them and becomes more efficient at processing them. And although there's still not 100% conversion to usable calories for energy, repair, and growth, more of the total food value is harnessed. If you are often troubled by loose and sloppy bowel movements, it might be due to the novel foods that you've eaten; you've thrown your gut biome a curve-ball. (It's not that those foods are necessarily ""bad"", and had you eaten only those meals, you likewise would have adapted to them over time, by modifying your endogenous enzyme profile). It's a demonstrable fact many people are enzyme-deficient. Some have a poor stomach pH, and will not absorb foods the same way as someone else can. But this is easily remedied. There's a limit to what enzymes you can make, but not to which enzymes you can take.

This is why I'm continually recommending either supplemental digestive enzymes, or enzyme-rich food sources, or both, if you're trying to gain meaningful mass. If you provide digestive support, you will convert more of the foods you eat into mass. If you're hell-bent on running GOMAD (Gallon of Milk a Day), but milk always makes you gassy and crampy, Dairy is probably not a desirable candidate food. (Though if you're determined to attempt it, it would behoove you to either drink only lactose-free milk, or take a lactase-containing digestive supplement alongside it each time. What sense is there throwing a food into the mix, if you're unable to process a component of the food?) Additionally, there is value in probiotics for gut biome support. 

Simply lowering the stomach pH (making it more acidic) can also help. Eating more citrus fruits, berries, and fibrous greens is another tactic to improve digestion. You'll be getting necessary vitamin C, valuable polyphenols and other micro-nutrients, but the biggest value is in digestive support. They also contain fermentable carbs that nourish the gut biome. These are the intestinal bacteria that help digest your other foods. Some of the things you cannot digest, your gut flora will digest for you. Then, you digest the gut flora, and the circle is complete. A thriving gut biome is absolutely necessary not only for raw digestion, but for overall health. At times, I've also kept a bottle of lemon juice in the fridge (not lemonade, but un-sugared, un-watered-down pure lemon juice), of which I drink a Tablespoon-sized shot after a large and bloating meal; it greatly assists in breaking down foods.

Further, this is also why I recommend sticking to 3 or 4 of the same meals which comprise 90% of your bulking diet. Find a handful of meals you don't mind eating all the time. Beef &amp; rice, chicken &amp; pasta, chili &amp; cornbread, beef &amp; bean burritos, tuna sandwiches, whatever your jam is. Rotating through the same small selection of meals will make food prep easier, it will make calorie tracking easier, and it ultimately helps take the guesswork out of what to eat next when it's time to eat again. But equally important, your delicate gut biome will become more adept and adroit and maximizing food absorption. More of the calories you consume will convert into usable energy, primarily in the form of meaningful weight gain. Try thinking of your stomach &amp; intestines as a living creature you have to take care of, like an exotic pet. And when you provide for all the needs of this magical animal, it returns the favor by nourishing and growing YOUR body in return. When it is happy and healthy, it will bestow great gains upon you!

"how do I add more? Hello all.. stats to begin: M, 18, 5'9"", 116ish lbs

I have been tracking my weight daily for about a month now and it has only gone down about 2 pounds. I don't really know where to add more food to my day, especially the days that I work. I work at a fast-food restaurant (let's just say we are pretty popular here in the Midwest). I work from 5:30am-2pm four days a week. I don't eat breakfast before I leave my house seeing as I leave quite early. I eat my breakfast on my break at 8am and my lunch at 2:30pm when I get home. My schedule and calories is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

**Breakfast: (about 400 cal)**

handful or 2 of cheerios before leaving home, coffee on my drive, packed breakfast of apple, 1/2 pb and j

**Lunch/pre-workout meal: (about 400 cal)**

wrap made of tortilla, meat, mayo and mustard, veggie straws on side and usually a little caffeine boost for pre-workout

**Post-Workout: (150 cal)**

1 scoop ON protein powder with 1 cup of almond milk

**Dinner: (800-1000 cal)**

whatever my mom makes that night. usually consists of meat, potatoes, veggies. varies night to night, but I always eat 2 helpings

**Snack: (300ish cal)**

somedays I eat a bowl of cereal before bed, other nights I make a banana shake that totals about 300 cal. 

**Total each day:** about 2300-2400 cal

&amp;#x200B;

I know this number is below what I should be consuming, but the thing is I don't know where to add more food. I can't eat at work during my shift, so there's a long time period where I go without food. Once I get home I eat a quick supply of carbs and protein then go to the gym. I come home, have my shake, then eat dinner about 20 minutes later. 2 hours after dinner I eat another 300-400 cal snack then go to bed shortly after. I feel full after I eat, so I'm not saving any room or anything. 

I have been lifting on GZCLP for about 4 straight months now, and my gains are leveling off. I know I need to gain weight, but I am having trouble. I track calories religiously, and I read this subreddit till my eyes cross. I am obsessed with lifting, fitness, food, and gaining weight. I feel I may have an ED but I am unsure. I just never know what to do and that doesn't help my brain. 

Any advice or anything is appreciated and I am sorry that this is so long."
"Kidney issues substantially slowing my journey - reminder to ""gain it"" while you can! Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for all of the useful information over the years as I've lurked. My bulking journey has been good, but we should always strive for better than where we were before, and you all have helped me push towards that ideal of continuous self-improvement.

Throwaway-ish because I don't want any medical information associated with my main account.

Over the past several years, I've been dealing with some odd medical issues that have culminated in a tremendous amount of kidney stone passages, muscle weakness, fatigue, and other negative physiological symptoms. The mystery has finally been narrowed down as it has gotten worse, and the gist of it is that I will have to slow/put on hold my bulking journey until we figure out how to preserve my kidney functioning. I'm in my early 20s, the prime time to be putting on some muscle, so this threw a bit of a wrench into my plans.

I'm going to be be on a low-protein (\~.8-1 g/kg) + high alkaline (fruits and veggies) diet, absolutely zero creatine supplementation, and lower-calories overall (no more high-calorie surpluses, so close to  maintenance).

I ask for no sympathy, and am only posting this to remind everyone to keep maximizing your gains while you can - one day you might not have the option!

I know this subreddit usually leans towards *maximizing* gains, but any recommendations on *optimizing*  gains with a restricted diet are greatly appreciated. Of course, I'll talk to my doctor further, but the ""collective wisdom of the crowds"" in a subreddit often offers interesting ideas!

(side note: bulking did not cause the issues at all, so don't get afraid of  protein, but continuing a bulking diet won't be good for someone like me. Don't worry about it if you have regular kidney functioning! I'm just the odd one out haha)."
"How important is it to get a post workout meal in? I've been working out later at night and getting home around 11pm. Sometimes after my workout and would have a 4th meal before bed. But The last 2 workouts I had very large dinners before my workout such as salmon, rice, broccoli, and asparagus. And instead of eating after a workout I would just go to bed because I am spent. Am I making a mistake by not eating directly after my workout and having my next meal in the morning?"

"Help me make sure I'm doing this right Hey. I finally started taking my health and appearance seriously just a couple weeks ago after having a sort of revelation about myself as ridiculous as that sounds. I'm a beginner to fitness and nutrition, and I need an outside opinion on this. For reference, I'm male, 5'11"", 145 pounds, and my goal is 160 with some visible muscle. Then maybe I'll keep going. This is my current routine:

* 4 moderately intense 30 min workouts a week (full body, upper body, lower body, and abs)
* 2700 calories a day (was previously only eating 1500-1700)
* 130g protein a day
* 347 carbs a day
* 90g fat a day

I'm using the app Lifesum to track my meals and the app Fitness Coach to set up my workouts. I basically put in my info and do what they tell me do to, which to me seems reasonable based on what I've read online. All my workouts are at home, all I have is a mat and a set of resistance bands.

What do you guys think? Am I bulking too much? Should I try to work out more frequently? Are these apps trash? I'd like to transition to a PPL routine once I can afford to go to the gym but for now I just want to make sure I'm not making a fool of myself.

By the way, I feel fucking great, like the best I've felt in years. Can't wait to start seeing results. This subreddit has been wicked helpful and motivating to get me started, so kudos for that. Thanks for reading."
"Replacing whey protein with mass gainer? 20M, skinny my whole life. A while ago I used to infrequently have Gold Standard Whey protein shakes, but ever since I began working out consistently at the beginning of this year, I've been using Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass instead of whey because of the high calorie content. My shake consists of 1 scoop of the gainer, 2 cups of whole milk, a banana, 2 spoonfuls of Greek yogurt, and a spoonful of peanut butter. Each one is about 1470 calories, I can usually only handle one a day (two if spaced out by several hours). I've seen all the ingredients in my shake besides the gainer recommended for whey shakes, but am I getting similar muscle/nutrition benefit by swapping the whey for the gainer and continuing to add in everything else? I'm asking because in past threads, people have criticized the use of mass gainer _by itself_ and have instead recommended a homemade mass shake that often contains everything else I already put in my shakes (on top of the gainer itself)."

Should I be working on getting my hip flexors stronger, or should I be doing higher volume squats with less weight to get the form down?

"Bulk/cut strategy So I’m a pretty skinny dude. Always been trying to add weight but never had much luck. I’m 22 y/o 5’10 and maybe 140 lb. (it’s been a while since I’ve had access to a scale, don’t go to planet fitness unless you have to) I’ve managed to refine my diet to a surplus of quality food (been lazy about exact calorie intake) and I think I’m starting to see some muscle gain particularly in the biceps. Unfortunately I’m getting a little pudgy in the belly. It’s not bad but ya boy wants to be decent in the summer. I’m considering a cut soon but I don’t want to lose any momentum for gains that I may have added or worse lose them entirely. 

Is it worth pushing through and continue bulking or is there anything to be gained by cutting before going back to a bulk? Is there a particular BMI I should aim for before considering a bulk? Or (however unlikely) is there a way to cut down the belly fat while remaining in a bulking state?"

"Does quite literally doubling your daily food intake get easier with time? 6'1, 125 lbs. I consume roughly 1200 calories a day. I've always been this way. Recently started trying to force myself to eat more, and it's fucking HARD bro. Feel like I'm gonna be sick most of the time. I'm shooting for ~3000 calories right now."
How do I know when I’ve recovered I’m somewhat in between an beginner/intermediate I’ve been hearing a lot about how overtraining and not doing too many sets a week per muscle group. How do I know when I’ve recovered after a heavy workout? Can I just stick to the 48 hour rule
"Anyone deal with tricep tendonitis from bench press/tricep pulldown exercises? I've recently developed a tendinous injury in the tricep tendon where it connects to the olecranon in the elbow joint. I notice this pain on my push days, originating with my bench press and becoming gradually worse after incline dumbbell press and peaking during tricep machine pushdowns. This leads me to believe my bench form is off, causing me to push mainly with my triceps rather than pecs. 

Besides lightening tricep load, I want to fix my form on these three exercises. I changed a lot in my bench press. First, I adopted a wider grip to emphasize the pecs, and also tried a bulldog grip with my hands. I also made sure to keep my elbows about 70-75º and not flare them out or into my torso. Finally, I'm more mindful of my upper body position: squeeze my scapulae together, push my chest out, and move the bar in a diagonal path rather than straight up and down. 

As for the tricep pulldown, I'm not sure what to change. I keep my elbows near my torso and my ROM is pretty wide, starting slightly above 90º and pushing down until my triceps stretch all the way. For some reason, this exercise hurts my elbow the most. 

Basically my reason for this post is to see if anyone has dealt with similar pain and gain advice on what else I could change to avoid this in the future when I start push exercises again. Thanks in advance!"
"Desperately trying to gain weight but can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong Hi,

I’m quite tall (191cm) and I weigh 65kg. I’m 22 years old. I’m very thin and I dream of weighing about 80 to 90kg (with muscles). I don’t think I’ll ever reach that anytime soon but in the meantime my mindset is to gain as much weight as I can.

In November, for about a month, I tried to have a proper diet : basically I multiplied by ~2 the quantity of food I usually eat. It was a difficult diet, both physically (it’s not easy to force myself when I just want to throw up) and financially. I didn’t try to « optimise » the diet by selecting only certain types of foods but instead, as I said, I just ate more of what I usually eat. Instead of having 100grams of pasta I would have 250grams. Instead of eating 3/4 of a pizza I would eat it all plus add 100grams of extra mozzarella. Same goes with other foods like chicken.

I must have had about 140 grams of proteins per day and more carbs than I needed (forgot the average quantity). I also have weights at home and did on average 20mins of workout per day. Despite this diet I didn’t gain a single gram (I weighed myself every evening before bedtime). It just makes no sense. I ate way more than I used to, so logically I should’ve been able to at the very least notice a small difference, right ? What’s more I did that during lockdown so my only physical activity were my workouts.

I stopped the diet not because I decided to give up but for ""logistical"" reasons (I went back to live with my family and I have very little authority in the kitchen ^^).

I was hoping someone could give me some advice on what to do now that I’m gonna go back to live alone and become independent. Any actionable tips? Maybe a secret life hack! I’m trying to find motivation to start again.

I was also wondering: considering I probably wouldn’t have any trouble burning fat (although I never experienced having fat in my entire life) would it be such a bad idea to eat a lot of junk food? I mean soda, sweets, chocolate bars and so on. I keep hearing people who avoid that sort of food because they’re afraid of getting fat. So why shouldn’t I just eat what fat peoples avoid eating? It probably sounds silly but I’m that desperate.

I’d really appreciate it if someone in this subreddit could give me some tips. Thanks!! 🙏"
"Making great gains but job (EMT on ambulance) hinders my nutrition. Ideas for nutrient-dense meals that can last well in a backpack all day? What's up gain bros? I'm on a bulk right now and it's going well. My biggest challenge is eating - I work as an EMT so I'll often be on an ambulance for 8-12 hours straight. I need help coming up with ideas for what kinds of foods to bring (and how to store them) in my backpack. Basically, nutrition heavy meals that won't get gross even after 6+ hours in a backpack.

"M/20/6’0” - 11 Months of gaining - 140lbs to 168lbs (+28lbs) Progress pictures - https://imgur.com/a/pdWcfkv

Background info - 6’0” and started at 10 stone (140lbs), was tired of being super skinny and decided to do something about it February/March of 2020.

Diet - During this time I lived with my parents so I would eat what they provided, I’ve always had a small appetite and most of the time couldn’t finish the meal in front of me. I calculated that I need to eat an excess of 2700 calories a day for me to gain weight. When I saw this number I was initially blown away because I couldn’t believe that I would be able to reach that especially with my appetite. But then after working out my appetite became larger and I was more hungrier throughout the day. I would eat all my meals which would consist of mostly chicken, rice, beef burgers, sausages, bananas, pasta and omelettes. Only as of recently I’ve started integrating sardines into my diet. It goes without saying that I couldn’t of gained as much weight as I have if it wasn’t for high calorie protein shakes, I would combine this with all sorts of fruits and yoghurt and peanut butter to bump them calories up. 
I didn’t track my calories and only ate more if I wasn’t satisfied with my weight the next week.

Routine - When I started working out, it was peak lockdown so everything was closed. No gyms to go to so I had to do workouts at home. I had one Dumbbell that my father had and only applied 5 kgs to it to start. I did bicep curls, hammer curls, pretty much everything I could do with a single Dumbbell until failure and did press-ups to end the workout. This went of for only a few weeks until I bought some resistance bands and smaller dumbbells to do laterals. I continued this workout every other day whilst still eating well until gyms opened up again in August. I’ve never actually been into a gym to workout before so all the machines were alien to me, I did some research and found a full-body workout plan that I have decided to follow and am still following now.

WORKOUT A -
Squat - 60kg
Bench - 50kg
Barbell Row - 40kg
Overhead Press - 30kg
Skull Crushers - 10kg 
Barbell Curl - 30kg
Lateral Dumbell Raises - 6kg

WORKOUT B -
Deadlift - 60kg
Lat Pulldowns - 55
Incline Dumbell Bench - 16kg
Dumbell Row - 20kg
Tricep Pushdowns -
Seated Dumbell Curls - 14kg
Facepulls - 

The workout alternates between A and B every other day.

I’m incredibly pleased with the result and having close family and friends compliment you just motivates me even more. Even though gyms are closed again (January 2021) I still do home workouts this time with more than one dumbbell :). Thanks for reading and feel free to ask any questions I’ll be more than happy to answer."
"Will bulking cause me to regain fat in a reverse order of where I lost it? I am sitting at around 10% body fat right now. If I were to start a clean-ish bulk at \~400 calories over TDEE, will I start gaining fat in the reverse order of how I lost fat? 

Let me explain more: let's say when I was losing weight/cutting, I hypothetically lost fat most significantly from my legs, arms, back, belly in that order. As I bulk, will I start gaining fat in the reverse order of belly, back, arms and finally legs?

I know that we gain fat 'all-around' but each of us also have places of 'stubborn' fat where our body only loses fat as a last resort and our bodies prioritize where we lose fat most first. Is bulking/cutting reverse orders of each other?"
"Anybody feel nauseous and then no appetite after working out? So I try to gain weight. I know ideally it is nice to have a meal/shake before working out and then after. 

However, my stomach is smol. I don't even attempt to eat before working out. But I did try to drink a cup of shake. Waited like 20-30 mins and then worked out. Felt nauseous afterwards. Then I tried to just drink water and no shake before working out. When the workout ends, I feel so exhausted that I feel nauseous and no appetite to drink shakes or eat. Hmmm :l 

Any ideas? 

Note, I do have gastric problems. And also I am VERY sensitive to smells and flavors and especially when I feel exhausted and nauseated- I don't want anything, just plain water. 

I suspect the exhaustion makes me nauseated. But how to avoid feeling this way? Besides I don't even workout as in holy shit type of workout- just glutes and beginner back muscles exercise that is very simple (but I believe effective in time). I feel like I lack stamina? Where to get it if I can't ingest food/shakes before the workout?

Thank you in advance :)"
"How affective are incline pushups for lower chest? Pretty much the title. My gym unfortunately doesn't have benches that decline and the cables are pretty limited and its annoying having to wait for one to come open, so I wanted to know if incline pushups would activate the lower chest well?"
"Progress M/33/5'8"" (118 lbs - 142 lbs) 2 years Hi gainers! I thought I would share my progress since I am coming up on 2 years of lifting.

Comparison pics (tried to pose as similar as possible)

A couple more current ones of back and legs.

https://i.imgur.com/5vHfNHL.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/Ix89CRo.jpg

Overview: Like many here I had always been very skinny, and while I generally did a lot of physical activities (running, hiking, etc.) I had never lifted before late Jan 2019. At that point though I decided to start lifting. My starting weight was about 118 lbs and I am currently at 142 lbs though I have been a little higher at times during 2020. I got a barbell rack in 2019 which helped a lot maintaining lifting through the virus.

Routine: From Jan 2019 - Nov 2019 I did stronglifts 5x5. While some say it isn't a super balanced program, I thought it was good to be able to focus on the core barbell lifts for a while. In Nov 2019 I switched to Reddit PPL which I have been doing up to the present. Any machine-related exercises in Reddit PPL I substituted with some sort of dumbbell exercise.

Diet: I did not generally track calories other than occasionally to see how I was doing. Most common foods were the normal oatmeal, protein powder, whole milk, chicken, rice, peanut butter. I most likely would have made more progress if I had tracked more often.

Current lifts: I haven't tested 1 RM but these are my current working weights (I don't know exactly where each started in 2019 but much lower):
-Deadlift 1x5 300# 
-Squat 3x5 235#
-Barbell Row: 5x5 155#
-BP: 5x5 150#
-OHP: 5x5 85#

Overall I am happy with my progress even though it has been slow and my weight gain has plateaued recently, hopefully this year I can up the calories to get back to increasing."
"Gaining muscle while lactose intolerant and find it hard to eat alot. Good evening/afternoon/day 

I'm asking about gaining muscle for some who's both got an extremely fast metabolism and is lactose intolerant. I'm new to this side of working out throughout high school and university I was a track runner so endurance was more my line and now I want to gain a little bit , I'm 70kg and want to gain about 10kgs.

Recently I bought mass gainer shakes and creatine (both USN) I had the shakes and took the meanest excuse my language ..shit of my life I don't know if that's just common with those types of shakes , it never happened when I used whey , I just wanted to know if there's any way to avoid it , I do take medication for my bowels but it would be nice to know. 

Also wanted to know if there's a diet for hard gainers , I know I can research and I have but I find Reddit has more people who can relate than MH or GQ articles.

Apologies for the long post."
"Failure and destroying myself on exercises I always feel obligated to go to failure, been lifting with a modest home gym since may, and my progress on certain lifts seems to have slowed significantly.

"How do you grind your oats to make them drinkable I tried 1/2 cup oats and 1 cup of milk (+ whey and some peanut butter) and then blended in a nutribullet... the shake was so thick and grainy from the oats. I ended up adding an additional cup of milk and blended it to make it drinkable.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Is this normal/ what to expect from a calorie shake or not? Please share some tips on how to get the oats as thin as possible.


Edit... just in case someone reads this in a year and wants the best comments:

- grind the oats separately and then add the ingredients
- put the oats and milk or water together and let them sog up and then when you add the ingredients to a blender it will blend easier.
- use a coffee grinder for the oats
- buy powdered oats"
"Explosivness and strenght / weight ratio after gaining weight question. Hi guys,

For a little bit of background, I am 21m
172cm (5'7)
70kg (154 lbs)

I have been physiqually active almost throughout my whole life. I have been doing rock climbing, crossfit, runnining, cycling and gymnastics and other sports at some point of my life. I have always been around 65kg (143lbs) but never actually looked skinny. In fact since I am short, I was looking rather fine. I never bothered to gain weight because I was already feeling in a great shape and being Light helps for climbing. I could always do 20 pull ups, run 10km, do 50 push ups at any point.

Then, 2 years ago I had to start a night shift job and it all went away. I was eating like shit, feeling like shit all the time, was not working out, ordering pizza, barely doing something active on my days off. At some point, my weight was 90kg (198lbs). It was not only 90kg, but 90kg of pure fat ! So when October came I got my shit together and décided to do a hardcore version of sober October. I cut off sugar in ANY form, bread (and all bread-like stuff) and alcohol. I also started running occasionally about 2, 3 or 5 km and doing some push ups, bodyweight squats etc. and Now I am back to 70kg and I am maintaining this weight for the last 1 month. it feels great! I am starting to get my old form one step at the time. The thing is, I would like to gain some weight. My mental goal is 80kg (176lbs) but what I am afraid of is that by gaining it, I will eventually lose my explosivness, agility, endurance.

So yes, I know that this is not easy at all but would you please give me your two cents on how do u think I could gain weight, improve my explosivness and endurance at the same time?

I don't have a lot of photos of myself. This is one from yesterday. It's not very seeable. It was taken on 7 degrees water bath but you can get a vague idea. Haha

"Program Review: Super Squats with Zerchers I hope something like this is appropriate for this sub. I'm not super strong  but I think my experience was unique enough to warrant a post.

**Background**

I was recently reunited with my weights after a 3 month hiatus where I did very little exercise and no weights.

I was inspired to run the program because of [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/jnz7zu/locked_down_only_have_a_barbell_and_limited_time/) write up by /u/mythicalstrength. His posts are honestly all gold but this one just really pushed me to try.

I followed the program as best I could with the equipment I had. I don't have plates below 5kg/11lbs, I don't have a squat rack, my only bar is a 5ft axle, and I train outside. This being in Ireland, that usually means pissing rain. But I think I stuck pretty closely to the base program and I even did pullovers!

Because I don't have the smaller plates I figured I would start at 20 and add reps every session. If I got 30 I would increase weight.

**The Program**

I won't explain the whole 6 week program, if you're interested I would buy the book. It's cheap, entertaining, and pretty convincing. I got my copy [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005)

I ran it in an A/B format. On Day A I did Behind the Neck Press, Zerchers, Pullovers, and Pullups. On Day B I did Dips, Zerchers, Pullovers, and High Pulls. I needed to get good at cleans to press anything which is why I did the high pulls.

I also did curls twice.

**Results**

   | Metric Before| Metric After| Imperial Before| Imperial After
---|---|----|----|----
**BW**| 86kg| 93kg| 190lbs| 205lbs
**Zerchers**| 60kgx8| 70kgx25 | 132lbsx8| 155lbsx25
**BtN Press**| ???| 50kgx3x8| ???| 110lbsx3x8
**Dips**| 86kg+10kgx6| 93kg+20kgx12| 190lbs+22lbsx6| 205lbs+44lbsx12
**High Pull**| 60kgx5| 70kgx8| 132lbsx5| 155lbsx8

\*Pictures Removed\*

I'm 186cm/6'1.

**Nutrition**

When I started I thought eating would be a total chore, but actually the appetite just really came to me. 

I ate 4 or 5 meals a day, usually eggs for breakfast, bacon or beef for lunches, dinner was whatever. I would say 95% of those meals involved me cooking something rather than just eating out of a packet. I was very conscious of getting enough vegetables into my diet. If you're eating more fats and protein you need to eat more fibre too. Usually I threw in a few vegetables with the meat and then had salad with the meal. I drank a lot of milk everyday but definitely not a gallon. I had maybe one beer a week.

**What's next?**

This program really taught me to work hard.  The first session, where I took what was a very hard weight for eight and somehow did 20 felt like it was the hardest thing I'd ever done up until that point. Then I did the next session. I was never entirely sure if I could add that extra rep until I did it. Adding weight was basically a relief because it meant I was back down to 20 reps.

I definitely couldn't run anymore of this program though. My quads, calves, upper back and erectors are basically always sore, I wasn't able to keep my conditioning up, I've torn through two pairs of jeans, and I had a small touch of hip pain in the last week. This is definitely not a program you run year round.

That said, I'm pretty happy with my results.

If anyone has any questions please ask."

"Advices for a body recomposition of a ""skinny fat"" Hi guys. I am 19 years old and I'm a bit tired about my situation with my body. 

I'm 180cm tall and I weigh about 154lbs.  It might seem that I'm pretty skinny, but this is not true at all.

In fact, my arms and my legs are skinny af, while my abdomen is covered by fat. I have already tried, during the last month, to follow a diet aiming to gain some mass, but what I got was just ""swell"" more in the abdominal area, while remaining very thin on the arms, shoulders, chest and legs, altough my workouts were really exhausting.

Surfing the internet, I think I can place myself in the category of **Skinny Fats** , and I have also found out that there is a possible solution to solve this problem: some months of body recomposition.


I had such a structured diet in mind:

my TDEE is about **2100kcal** 

**Workout Days:** 2100+20% = **2520kcal** - 3/4 days/week

**Rest Days:** 2100-20% = **1680kcal** - 3/4 days/week

With the macros divided as follows:

Protein: **160g**

Fat: **60g** (40g unsatured, 20g satured)

Carbs: **334g** Workout Days, **125g** Rest Days

Water: **2,5L/3L /day**

All this will be accompanied by free body workouts (unfortunately we are in Italy and we will be in quarantine for a while longer) whose main exercises will be:

Pectoral: pushups, raised leg pushups and some other variations

Dorsal: Chin-ups back and forth

Biceps: Curl with fitness bands or with something else

Shoulders: Front lifts with fitness bands

Hamstrings: deadlifts

Quadriceps: squats

Abdomen: crunch, reverse crunch and something else

What do you think? Do you have any advice to give me about workouts and, mostly, about diet?

Thanks in advance"
"Does timing matter for eating/working out? Building muscle requires two things, you need to break the muscle down which is done by working out, and then you need to repair those muscles by eating protein. My question is, does it matter when you do either? 

So when you work out, how long does it take for the muscle fibres to repair? When you eat protein, how long does it stay in your system?"
"An issue with my Squat that I don't experience with Deadlift or Bench Press, help please? About two months ago, I've started  noticing something that has been redundant with my squats. It feels heavy as hell no matter the weight on the bar. Warmup or working sets. And it was not always like this. Any idea to why this is happening? 

For reference point, about three weeks ago I did 100kg x 12. Today, warming up around 70kg felt nearly as heavy and I'm not joking. Then I reached my working sets 5X5 for 92.5kg. I really couldn't believe. I almost failed the last two sets. I don't understand, I repped 100kg for 12. Why is 70, 90kg feeling heavy as hell? 

Interestingly, my deadlift and bench warmups are feeling easier and easier. 

Nothing changed in my routine nor in my technique. It's the absolute same. I warm up progressively. Empty bar for 20 reps. Then 40kg for 5, 60 for 5, 70 &amp; 80kg for a couple of reps then I go into my working sets. 

I'm in caloric surplus and growing everywhere. Except my legs which seem to take more time. Can anyone help explain why this is happening? Am I losing strength?"

I think I can maybe do more, but I'm uncertain if I should.

Edit: I asked and apparently everything at this gym is in pounds (ibs) not kg.

Edit 2: it's lb not ib (I've failed as a physicist)"

[If you're curious, here's my 1 year post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/hy90on/m20510_1_year_of_gaining_115lbs_to_138lbs_23_lbs/)    
    
**Background Info**    
For my European/metric friends, I am 1.78 meters and went from 52kg to 68kg in a year (+16kg). Did not grow in height, maybe this will be the year?    
    
**Diet**    
I eat intuitively and whatever I want, in moderation. Lately, I like pasta and Cheerios. I don't track calories, but eat consistently the same foods. If I had to guess, 2500 calories for the first 6 months, then 3000 calories from months 6 to 12. Right now is slightly more but again, I don't track so I wouldn't know the exact numbers. Consistency is what matters.    
    
**Routine**    
Did [Reddit's bodyweightfitness routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) for 6 months, then switched to [Reddit's PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) for 1 year.    
    
**Lifts**    
Started with the bar (45 lbs) for everything. After 6 months in the gym, I could bench and squat 135 lbs for 8 reps. Deadlift was 185 lbs for 5 reps.    
Now, I can bench 135 lbs for 15 reps, and squat 165 for 8 reps. Switched out traditional deadlifts for RDLs, slow and controlled at 155 lbs for 15 reps.     
   
**Things that have changed**    
Clothes fit better.    
I feel happier, have more energy, and stopped caring about gaining ""fat"".    
I stopped lifting more than I could handle and instead focused on form. Deep squats are rewarding.    
My mental health has improved. Only took a (excuse my language) fucking pandemic for me to learn that this is the one body that I have, and I should take care of it.     
    
    
So yeah, that's my progress so far. Can't wait to see what 2021 brings. Thank you for reading. We're all gonna make it."

"Failure and Deloading Question for PPL programs ... It says that if you fail to complete after 3 consecutive sessions, then lower the weight and work back up. 

But what is the actual definition of failure?

For instance:

Example 1- bicep curls...if I do 10,6,5,4 and then the next time, I can do 10,8,6,5....is that considered one of the ""three consecutive fails?

Or does it mean something like....

Example 2- bicep curls...10,6,5,4 and then I can't get past those same rep counts three times in a row?


To me it seems odd if it was example one, because why deload when you are technically able to do a little bit more each time?"
"Formerly obese bulking way too hard, start over? I'm 21M 6'6. I used to weigh 305 and got as low as 175. I then decided I would start lifting and bulk properly on December 7th. Ever since I started lifting i've been extremely hungry and eating a bunch because I wanted to fuel the gains. The problem is I went from 175 to 185 already in under a month. My apple watch has overestimated my calories burned and i've overestimated how many calories I need to eat. Should I go back to a caloric deficit again? Continue lifting? Obviously 90% of that weight gain isn't muscle and I really don't want to get fat again."
"Lost 150lb - Now, 6 months into my 8 month lean bulk. Hey all,

I'm here with another progress picture from my lean bulk. I'm officially done with month 6, and I'm super happy with my progress. Really, I'm ecstatic with my progress. 

[From June 15th of 2019 to Yesterday (Dec 31st)](https://imgur.com/gallery/4mhuIML)

I've been doing a lean bulk at 250kcal over my maintenance. Obviously some days, I'll eat more, but by and large, I don't go over 300 over. It's been really nice to feel like I'm getting stronger without gaining too much body fat.

[6 month bulking progress](https://imgur.com/a/rlCYlmk)

Though, I am starting to see my lifts stall out a little. On Friday of last week, I wasn't able to finish my 5th set of squats, and only got 2 into it, before I went down. So, yesterday, I deloaded by 10lbs, banged out a full set without any issue. So, Monday, I'll hit it again back at my normal weight.

My issue is I think I'm not eating enough. Weightwise, I'm going up how I want, but I'm learning more and more that I should be eating for proper recovery and to see my lifts go up... not just to gain muscle. 

So, I'll be increasing my intake by another 250kcal to 500 over maintenance and see how I feel. It'll only be for another 2 months, but I have the feeling that the extra food will go a long way to help out my growth. I wanna hit that 1000lb club.

Current PRs aren't super, but I'm happy since just starting in July. 

Bench - ~180lb

Squat - ~285lb

Deadlift - ~405lb

At the moment, my program is based purely on hypertrophy with my squat and DL being in strength ""ranges"" for sets.

I'm really happy with my progress, and I am getting more and more enjoyment out of lifting and getting stronger. Though... shirts are becoming an issue.

Thanks for all the continued support and motivation. You've all been a constant inspiration between seeing progress pics to just learning more and more about weights."
"Phraks accessories Hey y’all,

Been doing phraks for about 2 weeks and would love a little more volume.

Can you guys recommend some extra workouts to add to this program?"
"Snacks vs meals M24 155lbs in the gym 5 days a week. I'm eating 2500-3000 calories a day. I work construction and dont really sit down to take breaks so I never really have time to eat an actual meal. So I'm eating snacks like cliff bars, crackers, and bananas all day, which actually comes out to about 1000 calories. My question is should I be eating meals to get those calories/macros or does it matter as long as I'm hitting those goals?"
"How to handle one or 2 days stalling on 3x DUP? Just started a 3 day DUP with each day progressing its own rep range independently and I'm seeing good progress. My question is, how do you handle stalls with multiple progressions?

For example, if one day is stalling but the other 2 are still moving. Or 2 days stuck but one still moving. Would it be best to recalculate max and reset weights for the stalled day(s) only?

Or is it likely that if I hit a wall in one progression that the others are soon to follow and it's time for full reset? I'd like to milk this for at while before moving on to another program."
"Constant lockdowns ruining consistency and ease to bulk - is it time to cut? Just been placed in another lockdown with gyms closing yet again.

It has been impossible to get into a consistent routine &amp; bulk phase now because of this. 

I have resistance bands but without a proper gym, machinery and weights I feel like it’s very very hard to bulk properly.

On my weight gain journey I’ve gone from 67kg to 75kg, I’m 5’11 so it’s not actually THAT much, but it’s a huge difference from what I used to be - but I’m still quite “slim”.

My plan was to hit the early 80s for my weight, and then cut down and maintain my lean body. 

However like I said, bulking is becoming more and more difficult workout gyms and equipment.

Even thought I’m only 75kg, is it time to maybe try a cutting phase and get more lean? 

I’ve got resistance bands so am able to build muscle but not a lot nor as easily as being in a gym, so I’m thinking maybe it’s time to try cutting down a little until gyms are open again?"
"Tier 4 Lockdown in the UK interrupting my routine, what now? I'm in Birmingham in the UK, they surprised us today with news that gyms are indefinitely shut from midnight onward :\^) how brilliant

My question is what do I do next, here's my thoughts: 

So, I spent the last 6\~ weeks retraining and regaining lost muscle from a big 2 year break from the gym, managed to put on strength, PR in all major lifts n lose about 3kg at the same time. Now at home in lock-down I can't train at my heaviest output (Powerbuilding routine) but can still train at moderate weight.

**Should I go into a maintenance/lean surplus phase as to not lose muscle like I might if I continue my cut with this lower intensity routine?** 

OR

**Perhaps the moderate intensity workouts from home will still provide a good enough stimulus for strength and muscle gains in this slow n steady cut?**"
"Awesome moment at the gym this evening. I have been gaining and lifting hard for the last 5 months. I don’t recall off the top of my head where I started but my deadlift has progressed to 245 5x5. 

My gym also has its own 1000lb club. There are plaques on the wall and you get your name permanently on it and a t-shirt when you make it. It’s a goal of mine to make it. 

I have slowly become buddys with one of the guys who works at the gym. The guy is absolutely jacked. Early on I expressed my interest to him in joining the 1000lb as a goal of mine. 

Well apparently he never forgot that. 

Tonight he came over and asked me how I was progressing and what my 3 max reps are. I have not maxed in a while so I told him I wasn’t sure. At this point he said.. let’s find out. 

Long story short, this guy worked me up to a 375 1 rep deadlift PR. And it felt fucking GOOD. 

In that moment we bonded. He helped show me what I am truly capable of and what it takes to start seriously progressing in my deadlift (and this same principle carry’s over to my squat). 

More-so, I have the utmost respect for this guy for remembering me and taking time out of his day to push me. Maybe he just got fucking sick of watching me lift light weight. Maybe he saw something in me that I didn’t see. 

Whatever it is, I feel like I pushed through to a new level of lifting today."
"What are some good additions for just working out at home? I've been working out with just dumbbells for the past year. I think I built some decent muscle and strength. Started with just 2 15lb dumbbells and worked my way up to 2 30lb dumbbells.

"Lifting while cutting - How much volume/cardio Hello all,

I've been posting about once a month with progress pictures, and I've been very happy with my results so far. 

You have all been a huge inspiration to me, and I want to continue what I've learned and progressed.

In about 2 months, I will be ending my first bulk phase and cutting  down to 10-15% body fat. Not sure what I'm at now. I've been lean bulking for 6 months, and I've noticed that my weights are moving a little slower than I'd like. 

I will be increasing my caloric intake to 500 over maintenance to help with my strength gains, as I've felt my recovery hasn't been as good as it should. In fact, it might not even be 500 over maintenance.

Either way, in 2 months, I'll be done with bulking.

I didn't see anything in the sidebar, but what should be lifting structure look like as I'm cutting. I would assume I'm not going to try to progressively overload. I'll be adding in some cardio while I'm cutting to train for a 5k. 

How should a 3 day cutting lift cycle look compared to my current program of hypertrophy and growth?

Thanks all!"
"Condescending tone aside, how accurate is this sentiment? I came across this guy's [angry-sounding explanation](https://i.imgur.com/iZgbBtf.png) about how women cannot hypertrophy their glute muscles and can only really tone them.

How accurate are they?"
"Would lean bulks work in conjunction with minicuts for gainers with higher bodyfat? Hello r/gainit. I am a skinny fat male who is [5’6 and 154 lbs](https://imgur.com/a/KYP9BE7). I am cutting as of now due to an earlier bulk where I [mostly put on fat](https://imgur.com/a/YLOXueH). Initially I was happy that I lost that pudge (down roughly 15 lbs) but as I slimmed down, I looked inadequate. I am able to see my chest and back a bit more, though I definitely am dissatisfied with their small size- especially the pecs

Would periods of a slow bulk for about 2 months (1-2 lbs/ week) rotated with a minicut (losing 2 lbs/week) for 3-4 weeks be effective for someone who is skinny fat? Dont get me wrong, I would like to grow, but I’d hate to go through extensive periods of either bulking or cutting. Would much rather just rotate between them.

Edit: Most of my body fat is evidently stored in my stomach and low back. Still have some as of now but every other body part is skinny."

"[Progress] Finally hit 225 on my Bench Press! (M/5'9/138/20) Hey guys,

I've been working on my bench press for quite some time now and I'm glad to say that I finally hit 225. I'll outline the process in detail below (video posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG-pPjLWnrQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR037jpPy-n8ypo3RVuYN0SBd8IhhqWOD2mwPzS-St9dY9Bvo179D8G3BQM)).

**Story**

I've been working out on and off since I was 16-17. Usually when school gets busy I take some extended time off, which of course kills a lot of my gains. Fast forward to 19 and I'm in decent shape, but my strength isn't great. So I set out to increase my bench. I started out at around 145, and my process to make gains would be to do 1 rep at each weight in an effort to eventually weigh up each time. Of course this goes against what every experienced lifter will tell you to do, but I found that it worked quite well for me when I was starting out. I would fail multiple days in a row (usually getting increasingly close to making the lift), which would culminate in me finally benching 10lbs more than the previous time, and for roughly 4 months, I rode this all the way to 205lbs. However, I found that that was my breaking point with this flawed training method. Predictably, my shoulders were also very sore, which coincided with school getting more busy. So, I took a 3 month break until September of this year.

When I started again, I had pretty much lost all the progress I made from the months prior, so I could only do 155. I knew that my former workout strategy would wear thin when I got to higher weights, so I decided to change things up a bit and adopt a real routine.

**Routine**

Now, since I started again 3 months ago, I have been doing a program where I do:

\-Workout 1: 80% of my 1RM for 5x5  
\-Workout 2: 85% of my 1RM for 4x4  
\-Workout 3: 90% of my 1RM for 3x3  
\-Workout 4: 95% of my 1RM for 2x2  
\-Workout 5: 100% of my 1RM for 1x1

Within each workout, I start out with 5 pull-ups to warm myself up, 5 reps of 45lbs and 95lbs, then 1 rep of each weight until I get to the weight I'll be working with that day.

I did this every 2 days without exercising in between in order to maintain recovery. The key -- for me at least -- was to be consistent and not skip any workouts because even 1 missed workout would kill my momentum.

**Diet**

I've been keeping a rather consistent diet for the past 4 months. It's a variation of the vertical diet and every meal consists of:

\-Pasta/White rice  
\-Beef/Chicken  
\-1 cup of orange juice  
\-1 cup of almond butter

Before workouts, I have a cup of beet juice and a scoop of honey.

During workouts, I have a cup of orange juice with a scoop of BCAAs.

After workouts, I have a cup of orange juice with a scoop of creatine.

Yes, a lot of orange juice.

**Other Lifts**

My chiropractor advised me not to lift heavy for back squats and deadlifts because I have scoliosis, so I'm playing it safe on that front and just trying to do light weights.

Aside from that, I like to do pull-ups, standing shoulder presses, seated shoulder presses, standing flyes, squats and calf raises. I don't specifically work on core very much because I feel it gets activated in many of the movements I do.

**Future Goals**

The primary reason I've been working out is to increase my strength in other sports such as baseball and football, so I plan to add some weight and try to ride this out as long as I can (hopefully weighing something like 160 and benching 275), then I'll work to maintain that and focus on staying in shape.

If anyone would like to critique my form I'd greatly appreciate that because I feel it's still far from perfect. I also notice that when I really push myself my right arm lags a bit from my left arm (even though I'm right-handed) so if anyone has any tips for that I'd love to hear some!

Also, if anyone has any questions, let me know!"
"Supersquats w/ leg press? Ive discovered supersquats and seems like a good program to begin. I dont currently have access to a squat rack, only a leg press. 

Following the program exactly the same in every other aspect, will using leg press instead of squats suffice? Or will it just defeat the purpose of the program?"
"A Tale of Two Lifters: ""Bulky Bob"" &amp; ""Gaining Greg"". https://oatsandwheytoday.blogspot.com/2020/12/a-tale-of-two-lifters-bulky-bob-gaining.html

**Lifter 'A', let's call him Bob.** Bob wants to ""bulk"" to build muscle quickly. Bob is probably already too high in fat to begin a massing phase, but he heard about ""newb gains"" in the first year of lifting, so Bob dives in with reckless abandon. He signs up at a local gym, eager to get jacked.

Bob starts with an incorrect TDEE estimation he thinks he can trust, since it came from a TDEE ""calculator"". But it's only an estimate based off of self-reporting of activity level. Bob fancies himself as far more active than he is, though in actuality he will be adding only 3 or 4 days of gym stuff to his otherwise sedentary life. Bob avoids cardio &amp; conditioning work altogether, because he heard it will make building muscle harder. He only wants to do enough lifting to grow, and nothing more. Bob is lucky if he follows any program at all...

What Bob does for the first 6 months is not a proper program, it's just a routine; it's just a list of exercises, and some of them he doesn't bother with. He does the same 3 sets of 10 for a couple lifts, mostly arms; and he doesn't squat at all because he thinks his legs are large enough. His leg size is mostly due to fat, though. Or maybe he squats once or twice per month. Because he wants extra definition. But hitting legs sucks, and is demotivating. He adds a little weight to the bar now and then.

Bob does some flat bench, some light overhead dumbbell work, plenty of bicep curls of course, cable-flyes etc., but no real pulling to speak of. Yes, he does some lat pull-downs, because bodybuilders do them. But Bob cannot do a single pull-up, because he's ""training for size, not strength"", whatever that means. He certainly doesn't deadlift, because Bob heard horror stories about shattered backs &amp; slipped discs. Besides, he doesn't really see the point. Bob is mostly preoccupied with his one-rep max for bench. But he also misses days here and there, worried that he shouldn't train while sore; or let's be honest, he just didn't feel like it.

Bob started out roughly counting calories for a month, but this turned into estimates, and soon gave way to just eating anything and everything he wanted. ""It doesn't matter, I'm bulking!"". If a pound per week is normal, 5 or 6 per month should be okay, maybe even better? He surely doesn't wanna waste those ""newb gains"" he heard about. Bob eats pizza, burgers, anything, everything, but he always remembers to drink a scoop of whey twice per day. Protein will make this happen! He wants to make the most of this Dreamer bulk he's on, and he plugs away at the same minimalist program month after month. Maybe half-way through the year he finally tries to follow an odd program he found somewhere, but Bob doesn't really push himself.

To be fair, Bob did see some real progress in the first month or two, since he was using some of these muscles for the first time. They responded with a little growth, because new lifters will respond to anything. He looked &amp; felt even bigger in the third month, since everything was definitely ""bigger"". He was holding more water overall, but then fat cells started filling up too. Bob kind of fucks around in the gym for about 60 minutes, when his workout routine would take anyone else only 30 minutes to complete, between all his mirror-posing and trips to the water fountain. He is good at tying up equipment.

Bob weighs himself only once every two weeks or so. Six months go by. Eight months. Bob feels huge, and he is. Oh, Bob does not train abs because ""you can't see them, anyways!"" Bob did not even start his bulk with abs, so he had no ""abs"" to lose. He knows ""some"" of the mass in his midsection is fat. Or is it? Is it food? Yes, it is also food, some of it from the day before. But Bob is stoked because of all the ""sick gains"" he's making. He knows he should ""cut"" as some point, to get shredded and reveal all the muscle he thinks he has built. But he still wants to make the most of this first bulk...

A year goes by. Bob has gained 50 pounds; five of them were water, ten pounds (at most) were muscle. Bob has 35 more pounds of fat now. Bob has fucked up his bulk. He is bummed and blames his ""bad genetics"".



**Lifter 'B', let's call him ""Greg"".** Greg also wants to start lifting, and build muscle. He will likewise dedicate his first year of lifting to this task of bulking. Greg has read a little more beforehand, on such topics as training and diet, so he enters this thing a bit more knowledgeable. He has found a good free program online, and he rearranges a few things in his schedule to accommodate lifting 6 days per week.

Yes, he's a full-time student, and also has a part-time job. But he's always been enthralled by a well-developed physique, so he will prioritize this. Sure, some things are on hold. He still has a good social life. Greg wakes up early to lift first thing in the morning. He is fortunate to join a gym that's only a 12-minute bike ride from his home. He eats a snack in transit, squeezes in a full session at the gym in only 43 minutes, rides back, showers, and drinks a meal-replacement shake. Then he properly begins his day.

He'd prefer to not lift so early, but that's what works for Greg at this time. He is mindful to follow his program, increasing weight when prescribed. He hits a different main lift each day in the gym, followed by a supplemental variation of the main lift, and then several accessory movements including opposite muscle groups and some isolation work. Greg is able to super-set the last 3 exercises in the interest of time. In all, it's compact &amp; well-structured. It works well!

All his compound lifts are going up, and he is visibly more muscular after only four months. He started on a decent introductory program which worked well enough, then Greg found a better program with more volume and a greater focus on certain body parts, and greater frequency for his favorite lifts. He was better prepared when he switched to it, since he'd built a base of strength first. He even looks forward to squatting &amp; deadlifting!

How does Greg eat? For the first 2 months he ate only slightly more food, because he was clearly hungrier from the additional effort. But he wanted to get a good baseline approximation of his personal calorie intake, since he was still learning to track calories accurately. Greg invested in a food scale, and a small amount of containers with lids; he settled on 3 or 4 different meals he didn't mind eating regularly. This was in addition to his post-training meal-shakes, and several snacks. He made a point of eating more protein overall, mindful to include green veggies, and healthful fats. Carbs made it easier to hit his calorie targets.

After ironing out the kinks of cooking, meal-prep, and bringing a cooler with food to re-heat while at work etc, Greg also arrived at a good figure for how many calories he now burned in an average day, in response to the amount of activity he now performed. It was only then that he decided to eat in a clear calorie surplus. He settled on +350 calories more than he burned, with the goal of gaining roughly 3 pounds per month.

Greg quickly weighed himself each morning after the bathroom, and recorded the number. This only took him 20 seconds. He would find his average weight each week, to track his rate of change over time. And although he bicycles to the gym in the morning (and to work!), he also added a brisk 1/2 hour walk twice per week, in the interest of minimizing fat gain while bulking. Around 6 or 7 months in, Greg started getting sincere compliments from extended family members (not just, ""my, how you've grown!"", but, ""Wow Greg, you're starting to look jacked!""). Classmates also responded with more attention, and he began to exude confidence.

Every couple of months, he would need to adjust calories slightly, to maintain the same gain over time. He makes it to the end of a year of consistent lifting &amp; disciplined eating. How was Greg's bulk? His scale weight went up a solid 30 pounds! Yes, he probably added 10-12 pounds of fat, but the rest was all lean body mass. And since he started out lean, he still had good definition in his stomach. Abs slightly blurrier, but still there. His arms were more vascular. Greg even had some striations in his chest and shoulders. In all, it was a very reasonable massing phase.

At this point, Greg chooses to cut for 10-12 weeks, in order to trim some of the fluff away. He wants to realize a little more muscular definition before bulking again, yet at a slightly slower rate this time. Bob, however, has not yet started his cut, because he's afraid to ""catabolize"" his hard-earned ""muscle"". Bob is currently an outspoken member of NattyOrJuice, shouting down pictures of guys such as Greg, claiming his physique can't possibly be attained by a natural drug-free lifter in such a short period of time...



The END

*(or is it?)*

**TL;DR:**

Don't eat accidentally or arbitrarily. Have a clear plan of some sort.

Make sure your calorie surplus is justified by your training volume!"
"3 compound lifts in 1.5hrs on leg day. Too long? I can barely do more than 4 exercises on leg day in 1.5hrs (incl warmup). How’d you all manage to squeeze in 6-7 exercises without spending 3hrs at the gym?

I feel absolutely knackered after the 3rd one. My 4 main lifts are squats, sumo deadlift, leg press and bulgarian ss. I go about 80% 1RM, 5 sets, 6-10 reps, 3mins rest between sets. I occassionally throw in leg extensions, leg curls and calf raises once every other 2 weeks. 

Should i cut to 4 sets and maybe 70% 1RM and do more isolation work?"
"154lbs and squatting 353lbs. How is this considered “advanced”? I’m 154lbs (70kg) and my 1RM squat is 353lbs (160kg). According to this website below, I would be considered “advanced”. I do not have any prior lifting experience and only started lifting exactly 1 year ago. How accurate are these levels?

https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/squat/lb"
"Are the basic compound movements enough to train legs? I do 8 sets of squats followed by 4 sets of RDLs and 4 sets of calf raises.

Is it necessary to do things like leg curls or leg press if I don't care about gains as much (I'm 6'4"" and was overweight in the past so I have pretty muscular legs for my upper body and I started lifting few months ago) Id rather focus on strength gains and explosiveness but don't want to train for it specifically because although I play sports, its pretty casual. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks."
"Is it normal for weight to fluctuate in the mornings? So i know weight fluctuates throughout the day since you are eating and what not. But what about in the mornings when you do your daily weigh ins?

I weigh myself every morning after I use the bathroom at around the same time. For about 3 months I was consistently gaining .5lb a week and every morning my weight would fluctuate by nothing more than 1lb. It was consistent.

Now, I am 149 and I seem to be stuck here. Ill weigh 150 for like 3 days straight and then one day where I barely hit my maintenance calories or am under it by a few hundred calories, the next morning i go down to like 148.2lbs.

How is that even possible? Like I said I know weight fluctuates, but almost a 2lb difference after 3 days if consistently weighing more seems weird? Especially since i have been gaining weight the last few months and the weight has been consistent every morning up until now where itl be good for a few days and then randomly drops almost 2 lbs"
"Good program for a cut? I recently went on a 3 month bulk (diet wasn't as clean as I'd care to admit) and made some significant strength gains (bench 205 - 225, OHP 100 - 115, deadlift 185 - 255, squat 165 - 215). I'm 6'0"" 180lb (182cm 81kg)

Only issue is now I'm at about 25% bodyfat and would like to cut to 15% or so while preserving as much muscle as reasonably possible. 

Lately I've been trying to just hit my compound lifts for less volume, keeping the weight high, but I notice I start to slack with consistency when I don't have a program in place. Any recommendations?"
"How different are results from hard isolated training vs more casual training with more rest?  I've been working out for several years. In the beginning I just went to the gym without really having a clue. The last 2 years I've been doing dumbell workouts at home. I'm quite happy with my physique so far.

It's only very recently that I've been trying to get a bit more in-depth info about working out (ofc. I knew the basics by now). Youtube channels such as Athlean x had me trying out more isolated and more intense workouts (the sore in 6 minutes series). I was amazed at how tight my biceps felt after completing such a workout, I saw veins on my bicep and forearm that I never saw before and I'm sure that I will feel the workout tomorrow, which hasn't really been the case with biceps before that.

So my question is: have I been wasting time with not doing these types of workouts before? I used to do biceps and triceps in the same session, a set of biceps, then triceps, with plenty of rest between. Any feedback/advice is welcome!

Also, how much further should you push after you get a tight pump?"
"Can't increase strength. Too much volume? Hey everybody.

I've been doing the J&amp;T 2.0 program for 9 months now. I modified it quite a lot, honestly, since I lift at home.

I noticed that while I got bigger, my strength hasn't gone up at all, in particular my bench press. 

&amp;#x200B;

My upper body/chest day is the following:

**Bench press:** 3 sets of X number of reps (depends on the week, but X ranges between 1 and 6, decreasing the rep and increasing the weight week by week).

**Close grip bench:** 4 sets of X number of reps (as above, but higher reps, X starts at 10 and decreases week by week)

**Incline Bench:** 3MRS (reps range from 15 to 6)

**Dips**: 3x3-5 (heavy low-reps) 

&amp;#x200B;

Then some accessory work such as skullcrushers, shrugs etc. 

I read around that when you follow such programs that are hypertrophy focused and you ALSO add more stuff, then it's obvious that you are not going to gain strength.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought of switching to more basic programs such as 5-3-1, but since I've been doing this much volume for like a year I'm afraid of backing off the volume just to gain more strength...won't that make me lose muscle? 

Thanks in advance."
"What causes fluctuations in strength and physique? Some days I’ll be able I’ll to use a lot more weight than normal, and some days I’m hardly able to lift for 1 rep what I did for 5 last time. Then I’ll look through my whole day seeing what I did wrong. What causes this? Also with physique, sometimes I look in the mirror thinking I’m jacked, then 20 minutes later I think I look like a starving child."
"Post workout drink - a myth? When we eat or drink any meal ( with the exception of pure glucose),  it sits in stomach for 3 hours and after that, an hour in the intestine, and finally the food moves to small intestine, where it gets observed in the blood. So I don’t understand the role of post workout protein powder recommendation consumption in a short window. Is this a myth created by the protein manufacturers? If I take adequate wholesome protein/ carbs earlier in the day, why should I need a immediate post workout meal?"
"Short on time - focus on a few with muscle fatigue? M/6’2/39  I’ve gained 20lbs muscle over two years of dumbbells and body weight workouts. Daily German creatine and naked mass shakes as supplement. 

Work and family is a big time limiter. I can usually get 45 min max for workouts, incl a five min warmup row on the erg. Trying to hit as many muscle groups as possible per workout and workout every other day. 

If I am short on time and want to ensure rest between sets, how about four compound exercises across four sets? Assume fatigue after 10-15 reps. Will this challenge muscles enough for gain?

Sample:
1. Bent over row
2. Squat
3. Pull-ups  
4. Bench press"
"Skinny kid bulking atm looking for input on my progress I’m 16 and 6’1. As a kid I’ve always been skinny and it’s been one month since I started working out but am concerned if I’m making good progress or not.

I’ve always hovered around 128-133 pounds and atm am hovering around 137-142. I haven’t really started noticing any real differences in my physique though

I’ve gone up in weight in certain exercises . At first I could only bench 45 pounds or just the bar. Now I can bench 55. 

Is this good progress for a skinny kid like me? Especially after 1 month? What has me concerned is that I don’t see any noticeable difference in my physique yet. I’m not expecting fast results but I’d still just like some input and any advice you guys may have about bulking."
"How do prison inmates bulk with few calories I saw some inmates with insane muscles. How do they do it? lift weight as much and as often as possible? I assume they don’t track macros and simply eat what is provided to them.

I asking this because, I am very lean (15+ years of long distance running), old (50+) and doing OMAD. I lift weights in a gym, but don’t  think I am hitting excess calories that is needed for bulking as it is becoming difficult to eat all in one meal. I love OMAD, it’s convenience and do cardio during OMAD. I would love to build muscle, but love OMAD and cardio  very much . Am I insane to balance all?"
"Improving vertical on off days? I’m trying to find a program where I can improve my vertical on my off days of working out. Rn I’m running ws4sb part 1 but I’m thinking of switching to part 3 or maybe running super squats. 

I need to to improve my explosiveness off the blocks in swimming, and I’ve heard great swimmers with good starts to have super high verticals upwards of 40 inches.

I don’t know what my vertical is now but a year ago I was 5’3 and had a vertical of 21 inches and that was before I did any sports but now I’m 5’6 and 120 lbs and my vertical is probably higher. I’m looking to get it up to the 30’s."
"Feel like I’m doing this all wrong So I’ve been lifting and bulking for about 6 months and I’ve gained more or less 10 pounds. I’ve seen some decent results, but nothing to crazy yet. My bench has gone from 85 to 135, squats from 105 to 145, and deadlifts from 95 to 135 (is this even good progress for 6 months?)

I’ve been super scrawny most of my life and I’ve noticed my chest and arms get bigger by a solid amount. But the thing is that I’m upset about is how much fat I’ve gained on my stomach and I’m worried my body fat % could be way to high at this point. When I first measured it, it was around 19%, which I know is pretty high to start a bulk. I’m sure it’s much higher than that now. But the thing is that the fat isn’t really going anywhere besides my stomach and I haven’t reached my goal weight and I still feel like I don’t have enough fat on my arms or legs yet

So I feel a little lost because I’m worried I’m not gonna look the way I want to before summer. I’m going to try to start working out harder from now on and go to the gym 5-6 times a week so I can work muscle groups twice a week. I anticipate going on a cut soon but I’m not sure when since I feel like I still don’t have enough fat on my arms or legs yet. Also, one of my biggest insecurities is my weak jawline and the extra weight has certainly made it look worse. I know that it will probably get better when I cut but I feel like it could be a while until I start that, so idk

Am I overthinking all of this? Something I’ve struggled with since I’ve started working out is not knowing who/what to listen to. I got a personal trainer but he doesn’t give me much info on my diet. I feel like I just need to be under the impression that as long as I’m working out hard and consistently, I’ll see gains no matter what. So should I ignore the way I look for now and just focus on the progress I’m making with my lifting?"

# January 2020 - December 2020 : Set Backs

Like most,  had a major impact on my progress this year. I took a break from lifting. March 13th to June 20th, roughly three months. At the start of lockdown I weighed about 156lbs. Come June 20th, my first day back to the gym, I weighed roughly 141lbs. A majority of my weight loss was from muscle. I did lose some fat as well. During that time, I still ate fairly healthy, just a lot less.

**OCD - Medication**

About a year ago, I was clinically diagnosed with OCD. Along with therapy, I was prescribed Paxil. I never took the advice of my physiatrist, mainly due to the side effects of the Paxil and not wanting to spend the money for therapy sessions. Anyway, lockdown plus some other personal issues were extremely hard on me mentally. I felt like I was going insane. So I decided to give the Paxil another shot. I started taking the medication around September - and boy was it rough. The initial side effects took about a month to go away. The first two weeks were brutal - I could not eat. I could not focus. My mind would space out constantly. I felt sick to my stomach every single day. But I still tried my hardest in the gym.

**Injuries**

Thankfully, I have not had many injuries. Barely any in fact. I really only have issues with my right arm. I dislocated my arm and have had tennis elbow a few times. I never stopped lifting during these injuries. Just tweaked my workouts, stretched the injured areas, and took turmeric.

The EASIEST way to prevent any kind of injury is to know your form and know your limits. Form is so critical. Learn it for all the major lifts. Learn what muscles are worked through each phase of the lift. Learn the mechanics. Learn. Proper. Form. I promise you, if you take the time, you will lift more weight efficiently and sustainably.

*Form Resources*

[Stronglifts](https://stronglifts.com/exercises/)

[Alan Thrall](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlanThrall/playlists) (He has playlists for each major lift with lots of good information in them)

The reason why I mention these set backs is to show how that progress is not going to be perfect. As long as you clock in, try your best, and clock out. You will make progress. Whether you are going through physical or mental challenges, get in there and put in your hours. That is as long as you are eating properly.

Programming

I started my first program eight weeks ago. [Powerbuilding II](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/shop/training-templates/powerbuilding-ii-template/) by Barbell Medicine. Since this is a paid program I'm not gonna go into too much detail about program specifics. Its fairly simple program consisting of four lifting days and two cardio type days with one day off. Ill give y'all an example of one of my workout for this week.

**Lifting Day 1**

Squat with belt :

***1 rep @ RPE 8***

***5 reps @ RPE 9***

***5 reps @ RPE 8 (-5%) Repeat until RPE 9 again (cap at 2 sets)***

Incline Bench:

***8 reps @ RPE 7***

***8 reps @ RPE 8***

***8 reps @ RPE 9***

***8 reps @ RPE 8 (-5%) Repeat until RPE 9 again (cap at 2 sets)***

Split Squats :

***10*** ***reps @ RPE 6***

***10 reps @ RPE 7***

***10 reps @ RPE 8***

***10 reps @ RPE 8***

Supplemental Work : Bicycle Squats (program has leg extensions)

***3x 12 reps @ RPE 8***

I definitely like this program. Its simple and doesn't need a lot of equipment to complete. Since I workout at home now it works well for me. I have seen a decent amount of progress in main lifts. Reminder I am just starting week 8 of this 10 week program.

Before - **Squat -** *290lbs;* **Bench -** *215lbs;* **Deadlift -** 365lbs conventional of course **Total -** *870lbs*

After - **Squat -** *325lbs;* **Bench -** *235lbs;* **Deadlift -** *400*lbs conventional of course **Total -** *960lbs*

Almost a 100 pound difference in 8 weeks. Pretty neat.

Home Gym Setup and Equipment

I was lucky enough to build my home gym over the summer. Spent roughly $2000 on the whole setup.

I built the deadlift platform myself for around $200 in supplies. With help from my cousin, built the plate stand for $80. Would like to add more equipment in the future but for now it works. I am a cheap fuck and my wallet needs a rest.

Two Year Reflection

This is the longest that I have ever stuck to something, consistently. I know that I have made a ton a progress since I started. I love lifting and don't think I will ever stop. At least I hope not. I feel a sense of relief when I am lifting. Just put on some suicideboys and pick up some heavy shit. Sort of an emotional outlet, I guess. I have learned a lot and its crazy to think back at the knowledge I had when I started. I still feel like I learn something new every week. With a lot still to learn. I would consider myself an intermediate lifter at this point.

My goals have certainly changed since I started. I remember I first started lifting to get chicks. Feels cringey now. At this point I could give a shit about how I look. I just want to be strong. I have realized that I have to do stuff for myself. Lifting is something I do for myself.

Plan Moving Forward

After I finish this current program, I plan on running this program again. I like the simplicity of the program and believe I have made decent progress so far. Sooo close to the 1000 pound club. My goal for 2020 was to hit that mark. Without  I would have made it. Oh well. After that I don't know what my goals are gonna be. Maybe I'll learn Olympic lifts after I finish the second round of the program.

Conclusion

Well, that is two whole years in the books. If anyone has a questions feel free to ask. It's been fun. If you are looking to build a home gym and cannot find equipment, check out [r/homegym](https://www.reddit.com/r/homegym/). Thanks for reading, I hope you all like these kinds of progress posts. I'll probably make another one in a year.

"Gaining Muscle/Improving physique on a caloric deficit Hi all, i've been dieting since September as i said i'd lose some weight first before i started, i'm now at the point where i want to join the gym and improve my physique and gain muscle, however i'm not fully done my diet, i still have more weight to lose so therefore i'm still in a caloric deficit. Would attempting to build muscle be pointless in caloric deficit? i have a friend who goes to the gym daily and says there won't be much results because i'm just eating around 1600 calories daily. i should also mention i'm 18, 6'0 150lbs. Will i see improvement in my physique/ body and notice muscle mass training in a caloric deficit? my body type at the moment would probably be what you call ''Slim fat'' i look relatively normal or maybe slightly overweight in clothing, but when undressed you can clearly tell i'm carrying some extra baggage, chest fat, love handle fat, stomach fat, its all still there despite me being relatively light (150lbs) Would joining the gym be the right move at this current time and stage? Thanks in advanced if you can help me out a little."
"New to working out, need some help! Hello everyone, I started working out around 2.5 months ago and I’ve seen quite some progress in terms of changes in my body but now I feel like I’ve hit a plateau. Compared to the first few weeks, I can’t gain anymore weight or lift any heavier compared to previous weeks (I was able to gradually increase the weight I life almost every week)

My height:5”8
Weight: 62-64 Kgs
Bf% unknown 

My current diet and supplements i take:

I start of the day with a cup of tea and 4 whole eggs with the yolk (fried/boiled)

Followed by lunch, which always includes white rice and some form of meat

Then I hit the gym and once I’m back, I have a chicken leg and thigh piece and 1.5 scoops of whey protein.(350 calories and 45-50g protein)

For dinner, I’ve rice again and some fort of meat

Supplements: I take muscle tech nitro tech whey with 3G creatine and 5g Bcaa per scoop 

Used to take BCAA and preworkout but have stopped since BCAA comes with my current protein and preworkout simply didn’t work for me 

My questions are:
1. Should I start eating more? If so, what should I eat and how much? Ps: I live in india

2. Does masturbation affect your body or your ability to develop muscles or lift weight in any way? It’s kind of an addiction for me. I’ve been trying to abstain but it’s really really hard 

3. I’m fairly lean but have accumulated Some fat on my belly etc due to the amount of junk I had during the lockdown, basically I can see outerlining of the abs under good lighting. Should I start doing cardio as well or should I just focus on bulking? 

Any help is appreciated"
"Anyone gained big legs without squats? Been battling with the form for years now and give up Had enough of squats and trying to get the form right just passed caring now, not going to compete just trying to get big legs.

Anyone have a successful leg routine without and what does it look like?"
"Increasing protein a lot for bulk Hey guys,

I was just wondering if anyone had tried a very high protein diet and if that yielded better results when bulking in terms of muscle vs fat.

This is because there is at least one or two studies that suggest that overeating on protein may not lead to excess fat gain, which I guess could make bulking cleaner if you hit a certain minimum of calories and just added protein to eat in a surplus. I mean this in terms of trying to minimise fat gains not just simply more protein = more muscle.

Here’s some links about this

"Dont be afraid of putting on fat I went through a period this past summer where I was obsessed with being lean.  In July I was 6ft and 140lbs.  I was below 7% bf and was in a bad place.  I was moody, starving myself and making no gains whatsoever.  But after a lot of research and better habits I feel so much better.  I found out staying below 8%bf for long periods of time isnt good for your hormones or testosterone production, especially as I was trying to get lower and lower.  I was eating like 1800cals a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Now about 5 months later I am at 165lbs and somewhere in the 10-12%bf range.  I am making massive gains DL: 225 -&gt; 300, Power Clean: 135 -&gt; 185, Overhead Squat 45 -&gt; 105 (sorry I dont test bench and squat much but Im assuming those have gone up a ton too).  I feel so much better during workouts and just feel better overall.  My diet is not restricted and although I still struggle sometimes to hit my surplus, not worrying about adding fat has changed the game.  Dont be afraid of it, its healthy and will make you feel better"
"Started bulking today and have had a lot of trouble. I was on a calorie defecit for like 3 months and developed really good eating habits that I didn’t have at the the beginning of quarantine. I eat all Whole Foods and have had steady weight loss. Decided to start bulking today and it’s been hell. I box and I don’t want to give that up I use a nutrition app to track calories and it’s telling me I need to eat 4,500 calories to gain a pound a week after I imputed my workouts for the day. I’m about 3,000 calories in and feel like I can’t eat another bite any help would be appreciated thank you"
"How to de-load to prevent plateau and injury? So I train pretty heavy on my lifts lately and I was just wondering when and how you should plan a deload. For example, for bench press I usually start my program at rpe 7 or 8 for 5 reps and whenever I hit 4 sets of 5 I add 5 lbs to the lift next workout. I’ll do this for like 2-3 months sometimes  until I plateau but after a while my shoulders start hurting and this sometimes leads to minor injury even. It’s not a form issue, it’s just because I’m benching very heavy twice a week and after a while the stress on the muscle adds up. My shoulders are very tight and I have to warm up and stretch them quite a bit pre and post workout to prevent injury. But for the sake of this post I just wanna know how to plan a deload to give your muscles a break and prepare for the next workout plan regardless of the exercise. 

My main goal is to build muscle rather than build strength so maybe I need to adjust the rep range too. So how do I know when to lower the weight and how should I plan my deload. Do I even need to deload if my main goal is to build muscle? Should I just lower the rpe down back down to 7 or 8 and then repeat the program? I’ve been training consistently for a bit over 2 years and still have lots to learn so any input is appreciated."
"Quick squat question Today I did 12.5kg on both sides for the first time as sets but because this is the highest I’ve done ever for sets I couldn’t go down as low as I normally do only about half way - 3/4. 

My question is the next time this happens should I do down one weight e.g 12.5kg to 10kg or should I continue with 12.5 and the next time I do squats I will do 12.5 again for sets and focus on going lower then last time ?"
Is this bench goal attainable? Hello so I’ve been working out for almost 2 years and my bench is absolutely horrible because I didn’t start benching until a year ago. Right now I’m doing 77.5kg (170lbs) for 3 sets of 5. At the moment I weigh around 72kg (160lbs) and I’m bulking up at the moment. I trying to get to 100kg which is 225lbs for 1 rep before April. Is that reasonable?
"Gain to maintain? 24F 161lbs 5’9, I really like the shape I am at the moment, I’m quite bottom heavy and I work out for about 1 and a half hours 5 days a week with weights. And the odd hike on my day off. I really want to maintain my shape and I enjoy working out the way I do for my mental health. I’ve noticed I’ve been leaning out the more muscle I gain even though eating at maintenance and weighing the exact same each week give or take a 1lb. should I eat slightly more in a surplus if I want to maintain my current physique and current gym routine?

Many thanks"
Whats your indicators that you had a good work out? Wondering what you guys feel after working out to tell if it was good or not
"Which felt more satisfying the first time it happened to you, 135 lb bench or 225 lb bench? Obviously the 225 would be more impressive, but which one did you feel happier reaching?"

"[Progress] Over a year of training, I am simply getting desperate about my legs. Any insight/advice for stubborn chicken legs? I'd appreciate any help going on forward. 

Context: Exactly a year ago I was weighing 54kg. Today, I weigh in at exactly 72kg. I exercised optimally to the best of my abilities. I followed strict routines and strict diets.  [28M]

Training wise, I'm no half repper and I don't sacrifice form for weight. I do things properly and go as hard as I can on every workout. I make every rep count. First few months, I was only hitting my legs once a week. I realized I was going nowhere so I started hitting them twice a week. One strength focused day and one pure hypertrophy day. And I'm still not seeing any results. I don't know if it's in my head and I don't see it, but whenever I check for progress, I feel demotivated. 

I don't understand. I think I'm doing things properly on all aspects. My upper body has seen a development I never thought I'd see. My legs on the other hand... 

And what's making me curious is that despite seeing no definition, I know for a fact I'm getting stronger every week. In fact, my squats are the only compound lift I haven't failed in a whole year of training. I started with the empty bar 20kg and only yesterday I repped 100kg for 10. 

Stats and measurements:

- Height: 1M77, 72kg.
- Bench 1RM &gt; 105kg.
- Deadlift 1RM &gt; 150kg.
- Squat &gt; I'd say 130kg. Haven't maxed out yet

"Thigh Gains I’m 6ft 4 185 right now. Over the past year I’ve put on about 20lbs of mostly muscle and saw particular development of my thighs. I have tell guy calves aka proportionally short gastrocnemius muscles which I don’t train enough because I’m a lazy fuck. I attribute my upper leg gains to learning pistol squats through yoga during lockdown and then continuing with more consistent Barbell Squats when the gyms reopened and incorporating more hinge movements with Barbell hip thrust and deadlifts. Thing is as my thighs have developed I’ve started getting a red rash where they meet. Does anyone else have that?? Anyone got anything they’d recommend to reduce the chub rub? I also have dry skin due to eczema so that probably doesn’t help. Yours faithfully, Mr Thigh Gains"

"Been lifting seriously for about 4-5 months now (mostly in caloric deficit) where do I end my current bulk? 21 male, about 180 lbs.

Been bulking for about a little over a month or so I believe. I'm planning on another 4-5 months ish I guess, or should I aim for a certain weight in lifts instead? My lifts have definitely increased quite well within the past 1.5 months, and much more since 4 months ago.

Lifts:

Bench: 120 3x8 (160 before bulk) &gt; 200 lbs 3x5

Deadlift: 120-150lbs 1rpm ish (I believe 220-250 before bulk) &gt; 350 lbs 1x3 (probably 375-400 lbs since this feels easy ish.

Squat: Absolutely terrible at squats for some reason even since I was a kid so avoided them but started them right the day of my bulk so: 80-100 lbs 5x5(and I think 150 ish before my bulk) &gt; 250 5x3"

"What is an easy way to eat a lot of nuts without tasting them? I bought a large jar of variety nuts for something to snack on while gaining weight.  I lack fat in my diet so I think nuts would be a good food for me.  However I hate most nuts and they're very dry plain, which I dont mind chugging a bunch of water while eating them but still this makes it difficult to eat a cup of nuts quickly.  Im trying to grind them up into a paste and just swallow it down with water but it's not as easy as rice.  Maybe I can mix it in with my instant oatmeal?

My regimen is also moderately hard (at least according to the trainer), so it's probably that I'm doing it wrong or adapting to it? But the thing is, I've been doing this every day since the beginning. When do I know how to stop? Does it *have* to be fatigue? When you guys work out, do you usually feel fine in that area the next day or is that just me?"
"One year progress 68kg/182cm/17M --&gt; 85kg/182cm/18M This last year really changed my health and strength, leading to more confidence, and also lessened my anxiety. I started at around 68kg with these 1RMS:

SQUAT: 50KG
BENCH: 40KG ish
DL: 60KG
OHP: 28KG

When I began training I didn't actually know what I was doing. I didn't know that there's high bar and low bar squat.
I didn't know that there's very little difference between conventional and sumo deadlift.

I got knee pain, lower back pain, elbow tendonitis
I've just fixed my elbow pain which was all my squat grip and shelf
Lower back pain is much better after training core exclusively and stretching my hip flexors and paying really good attention to form.

Over the year I have watched so much fitness content and most importantly form/technique. Calgary Barbell, Alan Thrall and Greg Doucette has taught me a lot. 

The program I started on were Stronglifts, but the volume were very squat focused and no progression scheme to follow.
After a few weeks I quickly found out that GZCLP would be much better for me. GZCLP teaches you to program on your own while progressing through rep ranges. It revolved around finding your weakpoints and including accessories that support your main lifts for that day.

Lifts now 3RM:

SQUAT: 130kg
BENCH: 90kg
DL: 155kg
OHP: 55kg

What have I learned?

Food and sleep is so important. There are days when I get 4 hours of sleep and the gym session goes to shit. Also don't be afraid to eat a little bit unhealthy. Just don't overdo it. Chocolate milk is my favorite. Ez 400 calories.

Form is really important. Protect your back, especially your lower back. Strong core and bracing is key

I eat around 3700kcal a day, 170g protein

"Any tips for those who work jobs that burn tons of calories? ***Edit: Disregard Numbers. Confirmed wrong. See below***


So, right now at my current job, I'm basically burning a minimum of 2800 calories. How do I know this? I do not, but that is primarily based on just the amount of steps I take via my google fit app. 

I also lift heavy objects at work, so I'm not too sure how many calories that will add. I'm also 6ft at 160 lbs. 

I just can't seem to get enough ""clean"" food in. I'm getting around 3600 calories a day, counting a cheat meal, but that doesn't seem like it's enough when taking into account the lifting I do after work.

Any tips on some easy foods to add besides a 1000 calorie shake? I guess I could add another shake, but I'm not too sure how that'll impact the amount of food I can take in. Just trying to intake as much as possible without feeling overly bloated, or having to stay up until 2am."

Achieved all this through mostly eating clean (dirty bulk in-between fyi) and a PPL split with a rest day on Sunday. Diet was 500cal above maintenance 1.5g of protein x current body weight for the bulk, PSMF for my cut. 

Was convinced I was a hard gainer who would always stay skinny. His sub and many others here on reddit changed that for me. I’m honestly indebted to you guys and many others for not only helping my change my body, but also for drastically improving my mental health through healthy dieting and exercise. Would love to answer any questions that anyone has."
"Failed bench without a spotter I went for 235 x 6 on my last set and couldn’t get the last one up. Right as I’m about to roll of shame it, one of the stronger guys in the gym came and helped me out. I thanked him and he told me that he went for 500 on bench in his glory days and failed. In a gym of packed people, nobody came to help him and he had to roll of shame it off. He told me he saw himself when i was benching without a spotter and rushed over to help. 

I just wanted to share this for those who may be new with the New Year approaching. Never be afraid to ask for a spot if you are gonna hit a close set, and dont be afraid of asking the big guys for help or helping them out when they need it. I could tell in his voice even after all these years he still felt hurt nobody came to help him. Happy holiday gains"
"Will my waist increase in size as i build? Hi all, 

I started out quite skinny from an injury, and lost almost all my muscle mass. Now im sitting at 135lbs and 5'9"". My waist bounces between a 28 to 29.

As i am starting to increase my ability to lift weights, will my waist increase in size? (Assume a clean bulk with less than 12% body fat throughout, since i know that fat will increase my waist - im only curious if muscle will by the end?)

Thanks for the insight!"
"Is someone who's 19-20% BF too fluffy to bulk? I'm leaning on doing a cut. Here's [me as of now](https://imgur.com/a/ZJefp9J). This pic was taken few hours after a light breakfast. My pulling and leg exercises have no issue progressing, though my presses are slow as molasses to build up. I am able to bench press my body weight (155 lbs) for 1-2 reps though I have recently transitioned to higher reps in my workouts to focus on building up size. 

I was bulking for several months from 140 to about 157 lbs but I noticed I gained a bit too much body fat. I'm down to do a slow cut since honestly I'm not too much of a hurry to get a decent physique; mainly since I mostly lift to cope with depression.

I definitely gained some back and leg muscle since starting out though my body fat accumulates in my chest and abdomen unfortunately."
"Daily Chin Ups Hey everyone,

Relatively new to lifting here and something I want to be able to do is increase my rep number of chin ups. Right now I can get about 3 good chin ups in a single set with my arms spread appropriate distance. 

I'm curious If it's advisable or possible to do chin ups every day or every other day because it's such a great exercise (and I'm also able to do it easily from home)."
"Do I need to eat more or are my expectations to unrealistic? Hey guys been lifting since roughly August.

When I started out my chest and arms grew quite a bit they started filling out some of my shirts and stuff

But I really started tracking in oct.

My weight then was around 165ish

My arms were a little under 12 inches - chest a little under 36 and they eventually grew to those measurements however

I've been tracking. It's now the end of dec and my arms and chest haven't really been growing. Been eating 3k cals a day - and 160-170g of pro. 

I go to the gym 3 times a week. I've been sure to alter reps and volume to work my muscles in new ways and shock them etc. Also have done different exercises just to target the muscle in a new way ( I don't go crazy with that FYI)

Anyways my current weight is roughly 180lbs and I can say I have gotten significantly stronger! But unfortunately my chest and arms won't grow now for some reason.

Do I need to eat more calories or am I being impatient? I have tracked my weight the last 2 weeks and it hasn't gone up at all. (It may have been at this weight for a week or two more as well)

I heard a rule of thumb is about 2lbs of muscle and 2lbs of fat a month but I'm curious since it seems I have stopped growing in my chest/arms.

Any suggestions?

EDIT: I am following a program from the wiki"
"Maintenice gainz? Is there a special formula for not bulking but gaining muscle without always bulking and cutting but just maintaining with growth? Not a big fan of eating large amounts of food. Love cardio and being lean but would like to put more muscle on. I’m 5’5 at 126.9 lbs, 27 years old, and always looked petite from the structure of my body. Embracing that I will never be a big guy because my frame is quite small. Just want to have huge arms and abs not trying to be Mr. Olympia."
"Will working warehouse instead of gymming be a detriment to gaining weight? Currently, I am 6'0"" 133lbs give or take so my bmi is 18 (pretty underweight) As far as bf% goes I'm assuming it's gotta be under 12 (male) but my scale says 7 even tho I don't look it, probably inaccurate.

Anyway my job at Amazon entails mostly walking around a warehouse and lifting boxes and bags, pulling around carts and whatnot. Shift is 10 hours 4 days a week. I was pretty sore however this has since passed, as if I were to compare it to actual training it's tons of walking and prolonged use of upper arms wrists and core.

I do not expect to gain muscle here because I'm already starting out so rail thin, I'm more concerned about losing weight somehow. The lunch breaks are short and my calorie intake is basically the same as before (though I've only been on for a week). I am genuinely incapable of gymming because I am just far too tired after a shift and the 3 days off I need for rest. I do like it so far but I have to see.

Will this make me lose significantly more calories than if I just returned to my sedentary lifestyle where I had no money and I only ate 1-2 meals a day? Or will I somehow magically bulk up or just stay the same?"

"Is anyone familiar with the MARSOC Prep program? I have some questions about it So for those of you who don’t know, MARSOC (Marines Special Operations Command) has an app called Fitness Prep. It’s a 10 week program that, obviously, gets you ready for MARSOC selection in the Marine Corps. I’m not going into MARSOC, but I am training to be a marine.

So I’m around 220lbs right now. At 6’0 that’s around 22% bodyfat, which I’m not happy with. I’m deciding to build muscle until maybe 235 and cut down to see how it looks. Maybe 235 is too low, or too high I don’t know.

Thing is, the program is a *lot* of cardio. More than strength training in my opinion. I wonder if I should add in a classic strength training program on top of this. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance"
"Guaranteed Way to Eat More If you're anything like me, you have been lifting for a few years now and have stabilized (er, plateaued) in your weight and your lifts.

In the past week I've started watching The Great British Baking Show with my fiance. Never having baked a cookie outside of tollhouse in my life, I was fascinated by how dough is made and how versatile it can be to make savory or sweet treats. 

I know it sounds ridiculous, but let me explain why this has allowed me to increase my food intake to gain a few lbs already:

1. You will be salivating when you watch the show, and even during the day when you're thinking about the show. You will be so hungry you'll go to your half empty cabinet or fridge and eat spoonfuls of pb or make a fancy quesadilla or french toast.

2. You will be inspired to cook more and try new creative ways to eat, which will reinvigorate your relationship with food and get you out of your food rut.

3. Because of 1 and 2, you will finally start breaking thru your lift plateau

"3 Solutions For Skinny-Fat Trainees From Across The Web Hello Once Again Gainers,

**INTRO**

From my time on r/gainit, I've seen many a trainee bemoan being ""skinny-fat"", particularly because they don't know WHAT they should do to address their situation.  If they bulk, they get fatter.  If they cut, they get skinnier.  What are they to do?

I figured I'd share 3 different approaches to address the problem, such that a trainee can pick A way forward and execute it.  A plan, executed violently today, is far better than a superior plan that never gets executed.

Without further ado...

**THE STARTING STRENGTH APPROACH**

This approach is for those that like the idea of beginner and intermediate programs, linear progression, few movements, and low reps.

[Article 1: ""The Skinny Fat Lifter](https://startingstrength.com/training/the-skinny-fat-lifter)

[Article 2: ""The Skinny Fat Lifter 2](https://startingstrength.com/training/the-skinny-fat-lifter-part-2)

KEY POINTS

* If you make your shoulders, traps, chest and upperback wider than your waist, you will no longer appear ""skinny fat"". 

* Growth happens by eating.  Eat to support growth as a new trainee and add some muscle.

* Once your waistline reaches a threshold (say 38-40"") switch to an intermediate program and lose fat until you get your waist under control.  Once you get it under control, go right back to beginner programs and start it over again.  NOTE: Your pants size is NOT your waist size.  Get a measuring tape.

* Focus on driving up your press, chins, pulldowns and deadlift to build up a strong looking upper body.


**2 APPROACHES FROM PAUL CARTER**

This approach is for people that have some meaningful way of measuring their bodyfat.  If the way you measure bodyfat is by taking a random shirtless photo of yourself and posting it online for strangers to take guesses, this is NOT an ideal approach for you.  This is also for trainees that use more variety in their lifting.

[The Article: ""The Bulking and Cutting Handbook""](https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/the-bulking-and-cutting-handbook)

TAKEAWAYS

* ""If you're a total newbie (or have less than a year of really intelligent training experience) and you're more than 18-20% body fat, then you're in luck. No really, you are. Because then you're in that rare period of time where you can lose fat while building a decent amount of muscle at the same time. Get into a minor caloric deficit and focus on banging out rep PR's on the big lifts.""

* ""If you're skinny-fat but in the 12-15% body fat range, then focus on eating a maintenance intake of calories or a very slight surplus, and then bang out the rep PR's.""

* ""The common denominator? Getting stronger in the growth-producing rep ranges (8-20), and putting on more muscle. The underlying problem with looking skinny-fat really isn't the degree of body fat. It's the lack of muscle underneath it.""

* For a solid way to get the growth Paul is talking about, check out the [8-12-8 method](https://www.t-nation.com/training/tip-the-8-12-8-method)

**CONCLUSION**

 There you go: 3 approaches.  You can up calories, linearly progress until you can't, switch to weekly progression while you cut calories and start the whole thing over again.  OR you can run a slight calorie deficit and focus on progressing until you no longer can, at which point you'll be leaner and in a position to add calories and chase PRs.  OR you can add calories and chase rep PRs.  It all works!  

Best of luck in your pursuit!"
"Rapid weight gain on lean bulk 18M 143 pounds 5’8” on my first lean bulk. Gone from around 2000 to 2600 calories per day over the last month. Over the last week I upped my intake from 2400-2600 and my weight has rapidly increased by around 4-5 pounds over the last 2 days. Most of the added intake has come from solely from carbs. Body fat % has also gone up based on a scale I have and abs are less visible. I’ve also been feeling sluggish. The weird thing is that i’ve noticed greater vascularity even with the higher bodyfat. It’s been pretty tough to eat the full 2600 each day from clean foods - not sure if that means I should cut back. What are some explanations for this? Should I cut back calories a bit to slow weight gain a bit? Also if I wanted to stay leaner is there a way I can cut every few weeks without losing muscle mass?
Thanks!"

"Substitutes! What do you replace your bad eating habits with? Hey everyone! I'm still early in my journey but I've learned a lot from this sub and want to give something back so here it goes.

Backstory: 
I'm about 5'6 and fluctuate between 143-147 lbs per month. It was quite a time getting here because I started around 110, skinny! I just want to fit in my t-shirts better :). Even getting here and finding motivation to eat correctly was difficult as I enjoy snacking and in particular, unhealthy snacking. 

 I've kept a list of some substitutes that worked for me and I plan to make these healthier over time. Personally I don't relate to the ""I woke up one day and started eating healthy"" stories, I found habits are a more resilient practice to keep yourself in check.  So I started with improving my grocery list.


Swaps:
Ice cream - get some greek yogurt of your favorite flavor (vanilla with your own toppings is good too) then mix that with some granola and/or berries. High protein dairy that has natural sugars to curb the sweet tooth. The granola gets some good carbs in as well.

Beer - this is a hard one but kombucha. Though not the healthiest of drinks I found that the ""kick back with a beer"" feeling was nicely replaced with one of these. Mio is another great option, I find mostly what I want is something that isn't water when I'm relaxing at the end of the day. The consideration for this is one serving of sugar vs alcohol, lesser of two evils approach. 

Chips - popcorn. Microwavable makes it easier to to avoid the impulses if you have some chips in your pantry. Stovetop is unbeatable though. You can even season the popcorn with the same spices as your favorite chips! Just make sure to get the unbuttered options if you're worried about fats.  Peanut butter pretzels are also great if you're trying to easily boost that protein count. I find downing an extra 20gs of protein is super easy this way. Also chickpeas are straight fire, fairly expensive unfortunately but they carry the same flavors as most chips.

Ground beef - I love ground beef but unfortunately it's not great to have it every day. Consuming large amounts of red meat increases risk of heart disease and I'm trying to run a marathon here, not a sprint. Ground turkey can be dropped in if you find you're eating too much. I've replaced most of my meals with chicken / turkey and ~ 3 days a week have a meal with beef or a red meat. It keeps me looking for to those days and keep on track.



These were the things that I would find myself craving  every night when I'm bored watching Netflix or gaming. Quarantine has made these impulses even worse. The replacements are just a step forward towards a better diet and some I still want to phase out (kombucha). Hopefully this helps someone improve their shopping list or make gaining look feasible and enjoyable. Drop what replacements you like! I'm curious what else is out there."
"[Help] Should I switch up my program? This subreddit has been invaluable to me and I've learned a lot. I would like input from the community on if a program switch is right for me in the new year.

**My Background:** 

38 years old, 5'9"", male. I've been taking gaining serious for 7 months. Prior to that I lived an entirely sedentary lifestyle. I've gone from 137lb to 164lb, and my bio-scale suggests 13lbs of that weight gain has been muscle. My lifts are up considerably. I've been running a version of the Reddit PPL for the entire 7 months, with focus on major compound lifts (Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Overhead Press, Barbell Rows). I work out 4-5 times per week. I'm still making pretty good linear progress every workout (i.e., adding another rep or weight to each exercise).

**My Headspace:** 

I feel OK about my progress, but not great. My friends and family have made comments about how good I am looking, but when I look in the mirror I mostly just see a filled-out version of skinny-me. I recognize 1.9lb of muscle gain a month is pretty good, but I wonder if my newbie gains couldn't be stretched farther. When I see some of the progress pictures on this subreddit I feel like I must be missing something. So many dudes with similar stats to me wind up looking like f'ing He-Man in a similar timeframe. My primary goal is to look good naked (e.g., hypertrophy).

**My Question(s):** 

Should I switch up my program? Is only hitting each PPL muscle group once+ per week limiting me? My thesis is that switching to something that hits my muscle groups more frequently throughout the week will accelerate my progress. I was considering switching to GZCLP, Starting Strength 5x5 or maybe 5/3/1.

I'd love input from you guys if you think this is a good idea. If so, would you recommend one of the above programs (or some other system) above another?

My biggest worry is that I've spent so much time just obliterating my muscle group on a given PPL day that switching to the comparatively ""light"" intensity of one the above programs won't effectively stress a given muscle group. Is that concern sensible or just in my head? I realize I'll get somewhat similar volume in, but it will be spread over the course of the week rather than in one day."
What are good lower back exercises? And not deadlifts mostly because I’ve been told(many times before) that you can’t do them on a smith machine from coaches. And that’s all I have use to plus I don’t have a spotter or personal coach/trainer?
"Grip strength as the limiting factor I do a 6 day PPL split and yesterday was the end of the week and leg day. When doing deadlifts I was feeling good in the back and legs, but my grip wasn't there. At about 1/3 the reps I usually do I could start to feel the bar coming out of my hands. Had to end all the sets early not because of fatigue in my posterior chain but simply couldn't hold the bar in my hands.  


Is this just a fatigue issue? Should I think about straps? I could do more isolation work on my forearms, but it doesn't seem like more volume would be the solution to this. Today is a rest day, so maybe that will fix it. Any suggestions?"
"When I bulk I have no appetite. When I cut I'm always hungry. Why?

Am I really as confused as a child who's told ""No, you can't play with that toy"" only to want it more?

When I bulked I did a half ass job barely breaking maintenance for the longest time.

Now I cut for the first time and my appetite is through the roof each night.

I can go without food for the first 4-5 hours of the day no problem. But when night comes I'm hungry for a snack every half hour.

I guess there's a larger difference in appetite than I thought for 3000 calories to 1900."
I’ve been gaining So I’ve been gaining and I gained 20 lbs had some new prs but now I want the abs. Is there a way I can gain and still have abs?
"Does having been fat, lost weight, then bulking make your skin better prepared to prevent further stretch marks? I lost about 70lbs last year, and I've bulked up about 15lb since. I got some stretch marks from getting so fat, and I've retained them with the weight loss. 

I couldn't find a study on this, I'm doing everything there is to do to prevent more stretch marks but Im wondering if my skins already prepared since having been fat before."
"Should everyone always aim for the commonly recommended protein intake? I’ve just been wondering if EVERYONE that works out in one way or another should aim to consume the commonly recommended protein intake. We all know the general rule is .8-1g of protein per body weight (unless you are doing some specific shit like body recomp), but I can't imagine this being the recommended amount for every physique. Let's pretend theres a regular gym goer, a powerlifter, a regular newbie, a skinny-fat newbie, a short and overweight, a tall and no fat on body newbie, newbie and a callisthenics trainer, and say that all of these guys weigh the same. Even though everyone one weighs the same on a scale there is no way all these different physiques will have the same body composition; some will have more muscle, some will have more fat, some with higher bone density, some with less, etc. Now I’m thinking due to these differences muscle protein synthesis will most likely happen at different rates and at different scales also (if you don’t have much muscle to damage in the first place then it will most likely not take much protein to repair right?). So is it actually necessary for people to follow the general rule of .8-1g of protein per lb of body weight when trying to build muscle or is there a better way you can approach this if you have access to data from a BMI scan?

I tried doing my own research on this, but can't really seem to find a straight answer. Wondering if anyone can educate me on this. Thanks lads."

"Nausea at night since upping calories Hi guys! 10 days ago I decided to start counting my calories and I got to the conclusion I don't eat enough and surprise surprise it was true! I've probably upped my calories by 1k (to 2.9k)

Breakfast - 150g oats with 0.5L Milk and a banana

Snacks - pear/apple, protein brownie /protein bar

Lunch - some kind of meat with few slices of bread and salad

Dinner - i go for a cashew or something like that and whatever my family cooks for a dinner

"[Progress] 18/M/6’1 - Recovery from restrictive ED ( 145 lb &gt; 167 lb) I struggled with a restrictive eating disorder from around April to September 2020. It really shattered my self esteem to be honest. I was obsessed over appearing skinny 100% of the time. 

However, I stopped starving myself after a while and turned to the gym. Since then I’ve gained about 20 lbs. Some of it is fat, obviously, but surprisingly it doesn’t bother me. This post isn’t to brag or show off by any means — I’m just glad that I have overcome my struggles.

"Following FAQ PPL, do I need more ab work? Hi! So I've been running the FAQ PPL for some months now and it's been very good! But I feel like my lower back is getting really strong but not so much my abs. With deadlifts and straigth deadlifts my lower back feels really worked compared to the front.

Edit: I think I worded this wrong. No, I'm not new to fitness. I started dieting and doing ab exercise and cardio almost 5 months ago, and I already have abs (though I'd like to improve them) and I've already achieved my bfp (though I'd like to lose a little).

I have been consuming a bottle with (2)Core Power 42g protein shakes with (2) scoops of whey protein at 25g each, for a total of 134g of protein.  

The rest of my day I’ll eat fish or chicken to get the other 60-70 grams of protein. 

Is this an effective way to get the protein I need to build muscle, or am I relying too heavily on the shakes/whey?"
"Relevant Podcasts? Hello,

Are there any podcasts that anyone would recommend? Any that has helped you? Any about gaining weight or relevant to the subject of this subreddit?

I'm not one for podcasts, but I'm going to be having a lot more free time (stepping away from video games/video game addiction - any help or insight into this would also be appreciated, but not relevant to this subreddit, I know).

Much appreciated!"
"Should I make my own mass gainer or buy one? I’m trying sooooooo hard to eat enough and with my work and school schedule I need a little help.

"Should We Have a (Pinned) Mental Health Thread? I've always been thin growing up &amp;amp; it's affected my mental health tremendously. I usually check to see how tight fitting my shirt sleeves are &amp;amp; if they're loose I get frustrated &amp;amp; anxious, it's usually why I wear the same tight-fitted shirts all the time. I was bullied a lot in junior high for being thin &amp;amp; it wasn't till seeing a therapist last year that I realized those experiences (&amp;amp; living in a racist rural environment) were traumatic for me (I suffer from clinical depression &amp;amp; anxiety). 

I'm 28,  been trying to gainit all my life since early adolescence (Arnold Schwarzenegger was a huge inspiration of mine growing up). I haven't gotten the results I've wanted but I've seen some success since working with my trainer since June  (went from 168lbs -187lbs w/12.2lbs of muscle; around 180-183lbs now since I had was on a minor cut. I'm 6'2). Mental health is very important to me but I didn't realize till recently that this whole issue effects most guys who struggle to gainit till I started therapy. 

Despite still not having the physique I want yet, my self-esteem &amp;amp; confidence have significantly improved over the past year or so (the training has helped but seeing a therapist &amp;amp; understanding myself better has helped the most). You definitely have to have that self-love despite your physique/appearance but being physically fit/muscular does help with ones confidence for sure. 

Just wanted to know how everyone would feel about this.

Edit: My intention was possibly having a mental health thread for empathetic purposes only. To convey how being skinny/thin is something that others struggle with mentally too. Anyone with mental health issues should definitely see a therapist and not seek advice on reddit. My bad for the misunderstanding."
"Mental fear/weary in starting to gain weight? Hi all. For the longest time I have convinced myself that my BMI of 16.3 is healthy and I don't need to change, often by justifying to myself that I have a high metabolism. Over the last week or so however I looked at myself and have accepted I need to gain the weight to push me into 18.5(+) BMI. To do that I need to gain approx 10 kilos, but I'm scared that once I start to gain the weight I won't be able to stop and I'll tip into being an unhealthy weight on the other end of the scale. I've been trying to incorporate more healthy food into my diet and right now its a struggle, but I don't want my body to grow accustomed to expect excess food permanently. Do any of you guys have any advice, or had similar thoughts when you started to gain weight? Cheers"
I’m 19 and a freshman in college. I played quarterback and played basketball in high school. Due to throwing and shooting so much I noticed my right shoulder is bigger and much more defined than my left. Any advice on how to grow my left shoulder specifically to even them out?

"Recomp, now bulk? 6 day PPL. Yo dudes. Long time lurker looking for some advice on a program.

Male, 182cm, 23, 80kg after a cut from 84kg. 

Been working out in a deficit for around 9 months, body composition has went from skinny fat to now starting to fill out. Happy with my progress.

Lifting in a deficit (1700 with some leaway on the weekends) Ive not had much improvement of strength or progressive overload but have improved.

I have always been into sports, played football (soccer) a lot in highschool etc. Found myself a bit out of shape at 22, decided to do something about it.

I usually train 5 times a week, 4 weightlifting and 1 day on the bag.

I want to now bulk, I think it's time. However, I'm apprehensive about the advice on the 6 day PPL, as it says it's more for intermediate or advanced lifters.

I done my numbers on the symmetry website and most of my compounds come in at novice level, with only the front squat further than this. 

I've never really had a problem with recovery but should I start on a 4 day upper/lower instead or do you think based on the above I could go straight for the 6 day?"
"Maingain I've watched a few videos of Greg Doucette and he basically discussed how bulking and cutting are unnecessary, that you can gain muscle eating at maintenance. He says that at a long term stand point, both yield the same results, but at maintenance or a little above maintenance but you are essentially at the same bf% but still gain  muscle. Would you recommend maingaining to a beginner? This is all new information to me so I don't know how I would approach using this tactic to dieting."
"Is eating too much calories bad for you? Hi guys! So I have started doing work out and eating for the past 3 days but I am confused on how much I should be eating. So I am 5""11 and weigh 133 and when I did the tdee calculator and it says that calories needed for me to maintain my weigh is 1968 calories. So from the advice of others I know that I should be increasing my amount of calories by 500 calories or so. But for the past two days of recording what I am eating I can force myself to eat around 3000 calories and its not too bad for me. Day one I ate 3400 calories and today I ate 2900 calories. So I was wondering if it is bad for me to eat too much calories everyday because I do not have any know of dieting and working out. Any advice would help a lot thanks!"

"Best Substitute for Milk? I’ve started my first ‘proper’ bulk recently and I’ve found that my upped intake of milk has really been messing with my stomach (at least I think it’s the milk).

"[Progress] 33/M/6'0"" - Made my initial goal, 128lb - 195lbs About 10 years ago I was 128lbs at 6'0"", a twig. I decided that I wanted to gain some weight, so did stronglifts 5x5 + GOMAD and got to 145 pretty quickly, and was pretty happy with it. I stopped pushing so much and lost a few pounds. Then I started playing street hockey and [quickly realized that my weight was a major weakness for me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCWWi4Is5oM) I decided I wanted to be bigger for hockey and personal reasons. I noticed at the time the average NHL player was 6'0"" at 195lbs, so it seemed like an ideal target.

Over the next 8 years I saw toothed in weight, gaining some, losing some, but during covid I decided to really buckle down and I gained 30lbs since November, 25 of them since March. I am now 195.4lbs @ 16%bf

My latest routine was Average to Savage 2.0 / Stronger by Science. Highly recommend it for someone coming from a SL5x5 or Starting Strength type program. 

It has been a long, long road. But it doesn't make it any less wonderful.

My next goal is to get to 195 @ 10% bf.

"[Progress] 21/M/6'3 (147 lb to 204 lb/ 67kg to 92.7kg) [1 year] \[Progress\] 21/M/6'3 (147 lb to 204 lb/ 67kg to 92.7kg) \[1 year\]

**Background:**

Been a tall twig my whole life, and decided in November 2019 that this needed to change. I had been dealing with clinical depression for an extended period of time, in and out of hospital and just wasn't happy with myself. Also living in China for a year and people pointing ""so tall and skinny"" all the time did not help! Whilst I was studying in Hong Kong I started casual weightlifting in November 2019, but not eating, decided I enjoyed it so when I returned to the UK December 2019 I decided to get on a PPL programme which I've stuck to ever since, with some adjustments. I have had to deal with 2+ months of lockdown which have eliminated some of the gains I could have made but I made sure to do some bodyweight exercises.

I am dealing with a rotator cuff injury which I picked up at a gym in Seoul back in March as I didn't warm properly (didn't know how to, I've been making this stuff up as I go along), and its bothered me ever since, currently in physio but it meant no benching for at least 3 months and even now I cannot push it without pain (urgh).

**Diet:**

For most of my life I would skip breakfast and go hungry because I saw eating as a waste of time when I could have been studying or doing fun stuff. This changed, I knew I had to eat a lot, how much? I don't know, I just ate anything and everything I could, at one point up to 1kg of chicken breast a day (you could buy 10kg in South Korea for less than $35). I was also drinking ON Gainer. I bought a blender a few months ago and make myself a 2k calorie shake every day, full of whole milk, Greek yoghurt, whey, granola, banana etc.

My BF % is probably too high, I have a bit of a stomach, but at this point I'm going for strength and size so I am not too bothered.

I take creatine powder on and off since May.

**Benefits:**

Feel so much more confident in myself, my rotator cuff hurts almost constantly but I can still workout, and hopefully physio will sort it. I've grown out of many of my clothes and friends are noticing me. gym has been a huge help for my mental health as well.

"[Progress] 25/M/6'4 (141 lbs to 165 lbs/ 64 kg to 75 kg) [5.5 months] Gyms are closing tomorrow cause of a lockdown in my country so I decided that I would post a little update on my gain journey.

**Background:**

Since 2013 I was trying to gain weight but never really committed to it. In August 2019 I got a severe concussion which I am still recovering (physically and mentally) from so I decided to take care of my body more and actually commit to gaining weight. From September 2019 till December 2019 I followed Ivysaur's 4-4-8 and gained like 5 kilos. I lost all of it during the lockdown of March 2020 to July 2020. I started again on the 1st of July with Ivysaur 4-4-8. Made decent gains but felt like I could step it up and started the reddit PPL on the 1st of September 2020. I kinda wanted to post a picture after 6 months to motivate others, since I got most motivation from the posts that showed short-term progress as well instead of the ones that took several years.

**Diet:**

I kinda stuck to eating what I normally did as well, but added 3 extra meals. Looks something like this

Breakfast: Cereal with milk

Lunch: Sandwiches

Snack: Cashewnuts (75 gram) with some chocolate

Dinner: Pasta/Curry/Rice/Potatoes/Junk food with quark and kiwi as dessert

Late night snack: 1100 Kcal shake or 500 kcal shake (depends on time and how much I ate during the day)

Total: Somewhere around 3000 kcal a day

Only supplement I use is whey protein powder. Started creatine at the start but got paranoid that I was losing hair so I stopped taking it haha

**Workout:**

As I stated in the background info, I started Ivysaur 4-4-8 on the 1st of July and switched to the reddit PPL in September. Have been running that since and loving it. Weight progress:

Bench: From 5x5 30 kg (66 lbs) to 5x5 50 kg (110 lbs)

OHP: From 5x5 20 kg (44 lbs) to 5x5 32.5 kg (72 lbs)

Deadlift: From 1x5 40 kg (71 lbs) to 1x5 75 kg (165 lbs)

Squat: From 3x5 40 kg (88 lbs) to 3x5 70 kg (154 lbs)

Losing gains after illness For just over the last week I’ve been really sick and I haven’t been able to eat solid food or anything that isn’t soup really. I’ve just about recovered now but I just looked in the mirror and I feel like I’ve lost a huge amount of my progress: I’ve lost around 7kg and t shirts that used to fit tight are now loose on me. I have literally no motivation to go back to the gym rn I feel like I did everything right and it was all almost erased by something beyond my control. Sorry for the vent but any advice would be really appreciated.
"Starting Bulk at 18% Bodyfat. Hey everyone, I'm new here so I'm not sure if this is the right place, but I'm gonna try.

For starters, I'm M/28, 186lbs, 6'0 

So like the title says, I was wondering if it's fine to start a lean bulk at 18% bodyfat. I've been cutting for 3 years since I was 325lbs. I've been trying to reach 175lbs, but it seems it's just out of reach. 

I'm going to be in a wedding in June. I was wondering if I could lean bulk for a few months after Christmas and start cutting in late April in preparation for the wedding. 

I've seen posts about waiting until your 15% bodyfat or less, or start when you can see your abs (which I can see pretty well; I'll post pictures if necessary). I just don't think I can get any lower right now, and, honestly, I'm getting tired of cutting. Just want to hear what others think."

Whenever I make up my mind to increase caloric intake (from 2400 a day to 2700 a day currently) or take a rest day, I get very stressed out and sometimes have panic attacks about not wanting to deviate from my normal diet and exercise, which has gotten me some ok strength gains.

"There Is More To Gaining Than Fat And Muscle Hello once again Gainers,

I've seen an issue in the discussion of gaining that I feel may need it's own topic.  Often, whenever a trainee here posts that they gained some amount of weight, someone will immediately chime in and explain that this person is gaining too fast based off some metric on how much muscle a person can put on in a fixed amount of time.  I think the currently en vogue statement is that you can only gain 2lbs of muscle in a month, so let's use that for now.

Trainee says ""I gained 6lbs this month"".  Helpful poster Johnny says ""You're gaining too fast!  You can only gain 2lbs of muscle in a month, so that means you gained 4lbs of fat!  Slow down the bulk!""


Folks, there is more to gaining than fat and muscle.  We're talking SCALE weight here.  Lots of things can impact that.  The top 3 (outside of muscle and fat) being glycogen, water and food mass.


**ON GLYCOGEN**

I'm not nearly equipped to discuss the finer details of glycogen, but [here](https://www.t-nation.com/training/question-of-strength-61) is an article discussing the LOSS of glycogen during weight loss and it's impact on the physique.  

&gt;You might FEEL like you're losing muscle. You might look smaller or deflated, but that comes from storing less glycogen and water inside your muscles. Glycogen is how your body stores carbs inside the muscles; it's a combination of glucose (broken down carbs) and water.  If you're cutting calories (and likely carbs) you'll store less glycogen. Why? Because you don't have ""extra energy"" to store since you're pretty much using it all.  If you store less glycogen and water, your muscles become flatter and smaller looking. A muscle with less glycogen/water is like a balloon with less air. That can mess with your mind, but it's not muscle loss.


In turn, when we're reversing the process and GAINING muscle, with it comes fuller stores of glycogen, which will add more weight to the body.  This is ESPECIALLY true during the initial stages of weight gain.  The first month or so one can see dramatic increases in weight, much like how one can drop weight dramatically in the first few weeks of weight loss.  If anyone has ever watched ""The Biggest Loser"", contestant would like 20lbs in the first week, only to lose little or even GAIN some weight in the second week once glycogen was depleted and they were focusing on ""real"" weight loss.

**ON WATER**

Glycogen pulls in water as well, which is another area where scale weight can be impacted.  On top of that, protein is the macronutrient that requires the MOST water to digest.  This is why most survival kits tend to base their nutrition around fats and carbs with only the barest amounts of protein to ensure survival: if you try going carnivore out in the wild with limited water, you're in for a rough time.  It's also why high protein diets can be of concern for people with kidney disorders.  All of that having been said, if you're taking in more water and HOLDING more water, your scale weight is going to be up FROM MORE WATER.  Water is not fat or muscle, but will impact your scale weight.


**ON FOOD MASS**

And then, there is just plain old food mass.  If you're eating more food, more food is going to be in your body when you weigh yourself.  Yes, even if you weigh yourself consistently everyday after a morning bowel movement, no human completely eliminates everything in their intestines, and the trainee making a concentrated effort to gain weight will have more food in their body compared to a trainee losing weight.


**ON ""GETTING FAT""**

All of this is written to say that you cannot just subtract muscle gain from weight gain and arrive at fat gain.  It's more complex than that.  And as [this](https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/oh-go-ahead-and-pig-out) article points out, it takes an honest concentrated effort to put on a significant amount of fat.  Getting big takes time, no matter if it's big fat or big muscle.  No one is going to balloon up in the span of a month.


So what's the takeaway?  Don't let scale weight gains trip you up.  Always remember: food is there to help you recover from TRAINING.  Train hard enough that you NEED more food to recover, then eat that food, recover and grow."
"6 month results from 72 kg to 82 kg. Cut time? So I have been following the Built with Science bulking workout and food plan. 

It has been really fun and definitely has gotten stronger and I can see a difference. But I think I went overboard on the eating since I have gained alot of fat if I remember correctly I was at 6-8% body fat and now I'm at 14.8% It's huge gain and for muscle it's only 63kg to 67 kg.

A few things, I live in NZ so all of the calories are based on products you buy here. I also don't have a day for Sunday because I take that day by ear and have frankly been a bit lazy to bother making one. 
I also have included my plan for when I mini-cut which is 2,500 calories. I normally eat the same thing everyday during my minicut, hence the one day.

Also, for people wondering if this works I went from 78 - 87kgs in 5 months on this plan. I then did a minicut for 3 weeks and dropped 4kgs and am now back to 85kg. Im 6'1 and pretty lean. To put in perspective, I used to box when I was 18 and fought at under 64kg. After boxing i got to 68 and sat there for 3 years and then i sat at 75kg for another 3 years!

"Eating too many nuts/fats? I am a 5'5 male - currently ~127-130lb. 

I have been trying to eat about 2600 (plus whatever are burned exercising) calories per day to gain weight. I lift weights every second day, and run or spin bike the days I do not. I don't have a huge appetite, but I have been getting about 1000 calories per day through this smoothie recipe I've devised. 

The smoothie contains 2/3 cup of walnuts among other things, that's 660 calories and 66g (90% daily value) of fats. Is this too much fat to be consuming? My meals are fairly healthy, but I'm sure they contain fats as well. I also eat high fat yogurt, almonds, peanut butter, etc. often. I know most of the fats are not saturated fats, but I'm concerned that I'm consuming well over the reccommended daily value and will eventually get chubby instead of muscular. 

What are your thoughts? Should I be trying to eat more carbs and lean proteins instead? I find the nuts are a really easy way for me to reach the calorie goal without feeling unwell. I have gained about 4 pounds in the last couples weeks from drinking these smoothies and beginning to take creatine and I am happy with how my body looks so far. Advice is greatly appreciated."

"2 lbs muscle, 3 lbs fat 30M, 5’10.5, 189 lbs, 16% body fat


I just did my first 8 week “bulk” where I upped my calories to about 3,000 per day.  Didn’t really track them, but I’ve been eating more than ever and trying to have snacks in between meals.

In that period I gained about 2 lbs muscle and 3 lbs fat.  Do these numbers sound pretty typical for a good clean bulk?  Or am I too far in the fat, not far enough in the muscle?  What are good number to shoot for in 4 week increments, based on my stats above?  

I feel pretty fat at the 16 pbf. I have 92 lbs of skeletal muscle now, is that any good at all?  I’m about 8 months in to training more seriously and am not sure how my program is going, it’s hard to quantify. Should I cut down to about 12% before trying to bulk again?"

I thought it wasn’t possible, I’m 5’7” , was stuck right under 140 for a few months, I weighed myself and was at 136 and knew I had to do something, so I started actually counting my calories, I went up 6 pounds in a little over a week to 142 although this is probably mostly water and glycogen weight, I’m still proud, and also amazed at how I never did this before, it’s so simple, I haven’t seen a substantial amount of fat gain and hopefully I can continue to gain and clean up the diet!"
"Weight Gains whilst on anti-depressants (28M) Basically what it says in the title. I've recently begun my first cycle of Mirtazapine, I was warned that it could dramatically increase my appetite as well as my weight. Being just over a week in, I've gained close to 4kgs and the amount of food I'm eating has jumped significantly. 

My issue is that I can't really find where exactly the weight is going. Before starting I was around 64kgs and now I'm up over 68kgs. I'm working out 4 times a week (and have been for several months) and I'm slowly noticing some development, but nothing I would consider to be the 4 kg difference. 

Does anyone have any experience or knowledge that they could advise?"
"[~6 month Progress] F/22/5""7/110lbs --&gt; around 130lbs Hey everyone. I know that this is a largely male-dominated sub but I thought I'd share my progress nonetheless. It hasn't been a while, really only around 5 or 6 months of lifting (and maybe 4 following PPL). But here a link to some progress photos  --&gt;[6 month progress!!](https://imgur.com/a/z2Ob1No) (left photos are clearly before and right are both me last week). I know it's probably not a lot of progress but I feel so much better!

I struggled with disordered eating for the majority of my life, excessively counting calories, weighing myself, starving myself, etc. I would never go over 1,500 cal and would be terrified of ""bad"" foods with sugar, high fat, etc. I was also obsessed with running, HIIT and cardio. I was exhausted all the time because of that and my low body weight. If I ever had a cheat meal I'd be going out for a run to ""burn it off."" Now I can eat anything without feeling guilty whatsoever. I currently aim to eat around 2,500-3,000 cal a day and follow a **100% vegan diet** (have for 7 years!). Never have I ever been more confident in how I feel and look. I'm looking forward to how much further I'll get and be able to lift! Weightlifting has surely changed my life and improved it SO MUCH! Thank you &lt;3"
"Am I wasting my time hitting one muscle group per week I’ve been following Jim Stoppani’s 12 week shortcut to Size for the past 74 days and have noticed a big increase in my strength. However, gains haven’t been very noticeable even while eating WAY MORE than I ever have. I don’t hit my 3400 caloric intake mark everyday, but come close more often than not.

I’m 6’2, 190 (Look skinner than I am) and was 185 when the program started, but I still have not seen many visual changes which I know will come with time, but I always feel like I should be doing more. The program is 4 days a week and like I said I only hit each major group once, and sneak in abs and legs on days that aren’t completely focused on them. 

After doing a little research and having conversations with friends, it seems like I should be hitting these muscle groups at least twice a week based on what I’ve been told about an upper/lower split. From what I’ve seen I think it makes more sense. I suppose the program i’m doing tailored more towards beginners or something of that nature. It’s almost complete, but I kind of want to drop it completely and start focusing on an upper/lower split. However, that will be decided on what you all suggest. Thanks in advance!"

"Planning on getting a tattoo in march on my ribs, im planning on bulking another 20-30lbs, currently at 155. will weight gain after getting tatted affect the tattoo in any way? when i bulk the biggest thing that changes is my stomach area so would a rib tattoo be affected my it?"
"Gym has become such a wholesome place to be and I’ve made quite a few friends already after being isolated for months. Every day I enter the place I wave at my fellow gym rats and we help each other out with plates and forms.

"[Progress] 30/M/6’7” (200lb&gt;245lb) [~7 Years] - TALL GUY Hi all, 

Just wanted to pop in with a little update. The last seven years have been a wild ride. I'm naturally very lean and putting on muscle has been a huge battle. Especially doing it all naturally. I set a goal five years ago to hit 250lbs lean by the time I turned 30. I turn 30 in a week and unfortunately I will come up a few pounds short... BUT that's okay! 

**Pictures** 

[Progress Photos](https://imgur.com/a/8msT6lZ)

I blacked my face out on the early ones because wow... not a great starting look haha. 

**Process and Mistakes** 

Looking back now I can see how many hard lessons I had to learn. I was so desperate to put on weight that I WAY over did it in the first year and got really really fat. Not just fat... skinny fat. 

Believe it or not I weigh the same now (blue shorts photo) as I did in the ""fat"" photo! Talk about a difference in body composition.

I certainly could have made this transformation smarter and faster.... but to be honest, I always tried to keep normal life in mind. I didn't want to let the gym consume my life. I wanted to still enjoy eating and drinking beers with the lads. So it's been something I've embraced as a slow and steady approach and I credit that for making my goals more sustainable and approachable. 

**Core Lifts**

The foundation of everything has pretty much been centered around big compound lifts. My current bests are:

Deadlift: 350lbs x1

Bench Press : 205lbs x2

Overhead Shoulder Press: 135lbs x4

Bentover Row: 155lb x8

**Future Goals**

Being 6'7"" was always something I hated. Now, I am much more comfortable in my own skin. It's taken seven years but I finally feel like I have ""filled out"" my massive frame. 

My next goal is to build on this and spend the next five years building a truly athletic physique. I'm hoping I can hit 270lbs at a lean bf% by the age of 35! 

STAY MOTIVATED AND CONSISTENT AND ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE! KEEP IT GOING r/gainit!"
"Disproportionate arms vs leg growth and adding arm isolation 1 year and 5 months into working out and just feel like my arms are lagging behind.

Could I add one day of just arm isolation even though it’s a 4 day program? Thanks"
"Dead Hangs every day to increase forearm size (Dead Hangs Every Day Challenge) #gains Been working out for 8 weeks now, I've recouped a lot if not most of the former size I cultivated my freshman year of college that I allowed to be recycled back into the temple of brodin.

I've seen 4 inches of growth to my chest, 3 inches to my shoulders, ~1.5 inches to my arms, .75 to my neck and a lot of seemingly unreasonable growth for such a short time span (including a well deserved 1"" of belly fat) on my dreamer bulk for 8 weeks.

However, my forearms have grown perhaps .4 -.45"". In order to bring these numbers up I am starting what I call

**the Dead Hangs Every Day Challenge**

The purpose of this is to introduce a small opportunity every day to get growth on my forearms by doing only dead hangs (which I'm supposed to do after every workout but I'm just too tired/sore/pressed for time).

The goal is a 5 minute window of my day every day to just hang from my home gym's pull up bar, for at least 90 seconds average between sets. As my forearms increase in strength I will attempt to hang for as long as possible up to the 5 minutes as well as stick a dumbell between my feet to increase in intensity every week.


This is a super simple thing to do that even if you don't have a cage rack like me, getting a pullup bar from amazon and just hanging to relieve stress between work is good.

In one week you will have accumulated an extra 35 minute workout that you won't even notice.

"[PROGRESS] 21/M/175cm 68kg/150LB [8 months] An update on my physique it’s been a while , was out of the gym for a couple months because of a bike accident 7 months ago that left me with a fractured ankle. Been back in the gym for a few months but have only been training upper body , not too keen on putting weight on my ankle from squats or dead’s

WEIGHT:

Dropped from 69kg to 62kg but as of today I’m back up to 68.4kg 

NUTRITION: 

Honestly haven’t been following anything strict been just eating my normal 3 meals a day with a protein shake and 4 whole eggs

WEIGHTLIFTING:

Bench PR was 97.5kg at my peak . Managed a shaky 90kg last week .Not gonna mention squat or deadlifts since I’m not doing them.

[After ](https://imgur.com/gallery/sObJdE9)

THOUGHTS: 

I haven’t been eating a strict diet and I’ve maintained my weight pretty well so what would be the cause ? I’m guessing most of it is water and fat although I do feel a bit leaner as of now ."
What should I check? I bought 2.5kg chicken breast yesterday and in the morning I put one breast on food scale and it showed 297g then I cooked it now it is showing 164g so should I check protein and calories of 164g chicken breast or 297g??
I’m really proud of myself I have anorexia and lost a lot of weight during quarantine my lowest was 98lbs I’m 5’5 so that is extremely unhealthy but I got help recently and have been eating a lot better and my weight is now 115 it’s still not the best but I’m feeling so much better I still look at my body and hate it most days but I feel like I’m getting better and I’m not tired or fatigued anymore sorry if this is the wrong place to post this I’m just really happy.

If my muscles are still sore should i skip a workout days? I started ivysaurs beginner 4 8 8 program on Sunday and my muscles have been sore since- I planned on going Tuesday but felt I needed more rest, so I went today but I plateaud on my lifts already..."
"Lack of sweet tooth makes it hard to consume shakes So, I love eating and I generally enjoy bulking, but I’m having trouble with shakes. I’ve had at least one a day for the last couple of months. While they’re no doubt helping with my gains, I have a low tolerance for sweets and it’s not getting much better. I use almond milk (unsweetened), peanut butter, bananas, oats, and flaxseeds. It’s not that it tastes *bad*, but I just feel so overwhelmed by the sweetness/richness, day after day. At this point, I feel like it’s affecting my appetite for the rest of the day. Is there anything else you recommend for quick, drinkable, but perhaps more savory calories? As you might’ve gathered from the almond milk, I’m vegan.

Thanks!"

"Training for hypertrophy questions Iv been doing a lot of research and I think I have a decent baseline of how to train for hypertrophy but there are some questions I have for how to optimize that

What to I do in between sets? It seems that I should keep my rest time &gt;1 minute, but in between the sets do I just stand around and recover? Can I flex the muscles I’m working right after and then Mabye do a light movement like a couple push-ups inbetween a chest set to keep tension?

What order do I do excersise in?(doing a PPL split x2) say my day is chest and shoulders, do I just knock out all the chest exercise first or can i start with chest and then super set shoulders in slowly towards the middle of the workout so I can keep a good intensity?

Is it better to mix intensity up during workouts? Start off with your compound lifts and slowly work your way into more pump training towards the end?

Any advice is appreciated, thank you"
"It seems like all that's growing are my legs / glutes. Which is nice, but my primary goal was upper body growth. I have been lifting with a newly purchased barbell and weights setup for about 3 months now. I am 6' and 185 lbs at a guesstimated 22% body fat. My ass and inner thighs are riddled with stretch marks and my friends say they see the differences there. I see no difference in my chest, shoulders, traps, biceps, or anything. I am doing full body 3 - 4 x a week. I am currently squatting 135, benching 115, and deadlifting 165. I am new to legitimate lifting, so I am not very skilled, but I am very frustrated with these results."
Difference between BBB and BBB Beefcake Hi! I've read the book 5/3/1 beyond and the article about BBB Beefcake and I understand that these programs are just an assistance work variation for 5/3/1. But what exactly is the difference with the BBB and BBB Beefcake (and the rest of the variations in general)?
"Running 3 times a week enough? I have a goal of 190-195 lbs (200 would be a dream) and am currently sitting at 185. 

Recently I had a PT test that I cut TOO close because I neglected cardio. It was a measly 1.5 mile run. Thought because it was a short distance, I could push it out. I was wrong. 

I’ve since done a 3 day workout PPL with 5 days of running/week. 

It looks like this:

Monday: Push day/ Easy 3 mile run
Tuesday: Sprints
Wednesday: Pull day/ 3 mile run
Thursday: Rest
Friday: Legs/easy 3 mile run
Saturday: Long Distance timed run (1 hour) 
Sunday: Rest

After doing this and getting a Body Scan (1 month total time difference) I’ve actually gained .9 lbs but lost muscle mass in all parts (Arms, Trunk, and Legs). This is also odd considering I’ve kept my caloric intake equal despite the upped cardio. 

I felt like doing this program was a jerk reaction to nearly failing this test. I want to continue to bulk and was wondering everyone’s opinions on the LEAST/most time efficient days per week required to do WELL/BE PROFICIENT on a 1.5-2mile run. 

Thank you."
"Should I maintain a caloric surplus even if I'm not working out? I'm currently very busy because of university, so I'll probably not be able to work out this next 10 days. I was wondering if I should keep my caloric surplus during the next 10 days, even if I won't be working out. I'm afraid during this 10 days all the weight I'll gain will be fat, as I'm won't be puting my muscles under any stress for them to grow.

Should I wait until I can work out once more before I go on a caloric surplus again? Or should I just focus on maintaining weight while I'm not working out."
"If i aways go to failure in every rep does it mean I always are progressive overloading? Training at home it’s hard to track lifts, so, can i just try to fail every rep and call it a day? (Increasing weight wen i feel necessary)

"What kind of weight should I lift on rest days to promote recovery without overreaching I hate rest days so I want to go in and lift very very light for high reps just to get blood flow without breaking down the muscle. I was thinking one horizontal press, one row, and a leg press but not sure about what kind of percentage of my 1rm it should be along with ideal set and rep ranges.

Cheers"
How do you know when you hit a specific muscle good enough For me working out back is one of the muscles where I don't know if I had a good workout or now. How do you guys normally tell that you're good or you should hit a few more sets

"What’s the deal with milk? I rely a lot on milk for easy, quick calories. I probably average about 1/4 to 1/3 of a gallon of whole milk per day. Opinions here vary a lot, from milk being a beautiful, nutrient filled food to milk being terrible for you.

Not sure where the truth is. Many doctors say milk is nutritious. I see people say the research on milk has been tainted heavily by the dairy industry over the years.

Should I be worried about my milk intake?"
How long does it take for your caloric needs to drop? I’ve been eating around 3000 calories a day at 150lbs for the past year and not really gaining any weight. I can’t seem to gain weight so I figure I just stop for a while and lose weight until my caloric needs drop down to a lower level. How long will that take?
"Feel like maybe deadlifts twice a week may be holding me back? I do heavy deadlifts on Thursday, 4x4 for example (which i enjoy). Then i do 3x8 on the Sunday (which i dread).

All my other lifts are going up fairly easily but deadlift is a struggle all the time and i feel maybe i shouldn't be going with so much intensity twice a week?

Today i did 3x8 sumos instead at only 55-60% of what i was lifting for 4 reps on my standard deadlift. Is this a good idea to continue or am i being silly? It allowed me to get through the rest of my workout easier and i feel i enjoyed it more than the usual 45mins of hell i usually go through trying to add weight to a 3x8 deadlift that kills me for the rest of my session and have an inkling it may be still fatiguing me a little come my heavy session."

"From fit to out of shape and skinny From 2014-2020 I lifted 4-5 days a week consistently and was extremely in shape. My biggest motivator was looking good and being muscular (I know it sounds shallow but I was in college). I was always skinny in high school and after gaining weight I loved/r/ my physique and thought I would never want to change the way I look. Then at the beginning of this year I suddenly stopped going to the gym, no reason why I just stopped. 

I’ve lost 75% of my muscle mass and hate how skinny I look but for some reason I can’t make myself go to the gym as much as I want to. I have a membership, it’s close by, and I have time. It’s like the motivation/discipline for lifting was deleted from my brain. 

And it slowly compounded because now that I’m less in shape I have less energy which makes it even harder to go. 

Has anyone run into a sudden loss of discipline? Does anyone have any advice on bringing the mindset back? My only theory is after “achieving my goal” for so many years it doesn’t bring the same motivational energy. Or maybe a second theory that after college, because my only motivator was looking fit for myself and as part of my social image, I no longer feel the need to try anymore.

Neither one of these make that much sense because I still have the desire to be fit but it’s the only thing I can think of."

"[Progress] 23/M/5'8"" (99lb&gt;118lb) [6 months] Realised this morning marks 6 months since I started really trying to gain weight so I did some reflection and am pretty happy with the progress that I have made so far. Thought i'd chuck it up here as a place to get some feedback and maybe give some people in similar situations a realistic goal?

**Pictures**

[Here are my comparison pictures, tried to recreate them as closely as possible, right after waking up, not flexed](https://imgur.com/a/3CCgzWi)

Should have taken starting leg pics -.-, but i'm pretty happy with this side by side, very obvious progress when you start out about as thin as you can be. Still underweight, but still gaining.

**The Exercises/Routines**

Started 6 months ago with Phraks GSLP,  my first week lifts were:

Deadlift 1x5@30kg

Squat 3x5@20kg

OHP 3x5@16kg

Bench 3x5@20kg

And these were a huge struggle, the doms left me crippled for week 2.

I spent 3 months on this program before deciding that I might as well go more than 3x a week as I spent my days off itching to go.


After looking for a routine that allowed me to go more times a week I settled on the metallicadpa PPL from /r/fitness wiki. I ran this for 6 weeks and was enjoying it, really started to focus on form for each lifts as I was starting to get more comfortable so my aim was no longer to just do the lift safely, but also to generate as much power as I can with current strength level.

Felt like pushing myself some more and nsuns caught my eye, so I spent from then until now on nsuns (about 6 weeks).

Current best lifts on Nsuns:

[Deadlift 4x87.5kg](http://streamable.com/rbqttg)

Squat 3x72.5kg - Didnt record this but [heres my first time hitting 70kg a couple weeks back](https://streamable.com/xywp2p), night and day comparison to when i [first hit 50kg on 31/7/20](https://streamable.com/ukitpl) and was proud of it til I filmed it and saw my form/depth was shit, dropped it 15kg and worked back up with better form.

OHP 3x42.5kg

Bench 3x52.5kg

Havn't filmed these two as much as my OHP has consistently progressed well and has felt fine so haven't really attempted to analyse my form, and bench is just awkward to film sometimes as only really good spot to put phone is on the other benches which are often occupied.

Bench feels like its lagging a bit, am currently planning on focusing on that heavily now like I have done for squat/deadlift form to figure out where i'm missing power if it's technique or training or what.

**The Future**

Nsuns kicked my ass, which is what I wanted when I chose it, I'm pretty happy with where I am right now and what I got out of it, my current plan is to shift to a submaximal training format for a bit as the forced linear progression on nsuns has made some days daunting (most likely a 5/3/1, probably will start some cycles of 5314B and then i'm considering really going for size and doing the [6 month block laid out here](https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/j5q2ez/6_months_of_eating_and_training_for_mass_laid_out/) by /u/mythicalstrength while taking diet more seriously)

Current measurable goals are a 2x bw squat+deadlift, I'd also love to hit a bodyweight ohp while im reasonably lean, and i'd like to eventually rip an old shirt (but who doesn't?), the rest is just general strength+size increase I don't really have an end goal.

**Diet**

When I started I focused hard on just eating as much as possible, always had struggled with appetite like many others here, I started at the gym between semesters at uni so I had a few weeks break where I could purely focus on eating and working out, and thats what I did. If I could eat more, I did, it was a miserable bloated and nauseated few weeks but it kick started my appetite.

Spent some time counting calories but it really just wasn't for me, I realised if I had to keep so strict on myself I would burn out. The time spent counting gave me a rough idea of how much food I needed to eat to gain and what good recovery/growth felt like, so I just tried to base it on that while tracking my weight daily. If I was hitting my protein count and both my weight and lifts were going up I was happy, at my starting weight the idea of putting on some fat obviously did not scare me at all.

As far as what I ate goes, old me ate twice a day, and one of those meals would be something like instant noodles, with a bit of thought it wasn't too hard to improve. My start was to just swap foods out for better foods and try eat more of them, greek yoghurt instead of noodles, snacking on nuts, making sure I ate when I woke up instead of waiting 6 hours, eating when I COULD rather than when I NEEDED to. Feels like more of a mindset shift than actual diet. Just started to be more conscious of what kind of macros were in different foods and kept them in mind.

Whey protein once a day w/milk, greek yoghurt, nuts, nut bars, proper meal for dinner such as the classic chicken+rice, eating right before going to sleep, maybe a little too much reliance on easy junk calories such as a snickers bar or pizza. These changes were so drastically different from what I was previously doing, that making them just made me start rapidly putting on weight so I didn't put too much more thought into diet. If my weight/strength wasnt stalling and I was recovering adequately, i'm happy with what i'm doing. 

Met my (rough idea of) calorie count and protein count (0.8g/lb minimum, was more like 1.5g/lb most days - not hard to hit this protein count when you're ~100lb, protein shake alone is about half that) and try eat some variety  was all I considered.

Supplemented whey protein and creatine from about month 2."
"Do you do mobility exercises I have recently been looking in to mobility exercises like hip and ankle, and follow the r/flexibility sub which is really helpful. I was wondering how many of you gainers also do mobility exercises on top of your programme. If you do, do you do this on rest days or training days? And what exercises/routines do you find most helpful that can aid your lifts?

"nOoB: Is it possible to gain size without adding too much fat on a smaller frame? I’m 30 years young rigging in at 167 lb standing at a staggering height of 5’5. 

I have an average frame and have been told I’m wide, but I would like to gain some size, without adding too much fat.

I feel I gain fat easily especially being on a shorter side and goes right to the love handles.

I currently hit the gym 3-4 times a week (just started again since they re opened).

Anyway, I would like to add some size, has anyone maybe with similar stats have been able to gain without adding too much fat?"
Long arms. How long did it take for size to visibly show? I have pretty long arms and have been training for 3 months. Of course this gym thing is all about patience and consistency. But. curious to know how long it look others wth long arms to visibly see a difference in the size of their arms.
"Am I eating too much protein? Sorry for the stupid clickbait title, but that’s basically my question. I am 5’9’ and I weigh 128 lbs. I have been eating 160g of protein a day, as well as lifting every other day. Is that too much? A couple muscle gaining calculators gave me similar amount of grams."

My bench and dead were surprisingly good, especially the dead, I killed it but my squat was soooo damn hard. I used to think my squat was my best lift, but now it's by far my weakest. Anyone else relate? What caused the decline? I've been training it just as much as the other lifts, possibly not as intensely though. How'd you manage to get it back up again?"
"Throwing up from GOMAD Jesus fuck I just threw up my whole fucking stomach in my bathroom no longer than 10 minutes ago 

This is the first day that I actually counted calories and achieved 3000 calories but I feel like 1000 of that just went down my toilet

I chugged 2 litres of milk about an hour ago and as soon as I took that last sip my throat started watering and I knew I was fucked

I know it was due to overeating cause I soon as I threw up I felt much better 

Obviously I realize now that I should have taken more smaller portions instead of chugging 2 litres in 20 minutes... Does anyone have any other tips?"

"Unsure How to Best Proceed **Context:**

* 31 M, 6'1"" \~180 lbs (186 cm 82 kg). Current body comp @ 13% body fat.
* Lifting for \~6 years
* Plateau'd on horizontal press and squats around 205 and 270 respectively (before 03/2020)
* Primarily interested in functional strength with subsidiary aesthetic goals.

**Problem:**

Was doing home workouts from March until September, with a cut so I was down to 170 @ 9% BF. Gyms opened back up so I decided to do a bulk through the end of the year. Started a very rudimentary six-week PPL routine for six-days a week to get back into heavier lifting. Made good progress, got back up to 280 deadlifts and 200 horizontal press, but was lacking on squats (I think because I've been biking a ton and it's exhausting my quads more?)

Gyms are mostly closed back down now. I have access to an outdoor facility (for who knows how long). Reservations are required and only last an hour. I can probably scrape out a bit more than an hour since I work at the gym, but making a reservation is tight since there's easily several thousand members trying to find time and only about 120 slots an hour for about 14 hours a day.

* I'm used to doing a split and hitting every muscle group twice a week for both strength and growth. 
* I'm used to a minimal diet and keeping a relatively low body fat % (between 8 and 10). 
* I think some of my plateaus are purely mental (I'm definitely very afraid of injury). 
* I'm pretty sure I can only reliably get between 3 and 4 reservations a week.
* I have to bike to the gym.

**Possibilities**:

I'm trying to consider what I can do for the next few months that will have earnest payoff. I'm nervous about bulking because the body dysphoria is pretty severe since my lifting journey started with a 100 lb loss. My inclination is to try something like GVL (German Volume Lifting) since it's an every other day routine, but I wonder about doing full-body stuff every other day instead? I'm also wondering what impact the biking is going to have on my ability to push my leg lifts, and how I can circumvent any ""'downsides"" to that if they exist at all.

What are y'alls thoughts on full-body versus something like GVL (or supplementing offdays with home workouts)?

"Gained 17 pounds this year, don’t have anyone else to tell so I figured I’d share it here I’m 6’3 and a year ago I was a little over 120 pounds. Never had any health issues or an ED but like, holy shit was I underweight! I’ve been very skinny and insecure about it my whole life but never realized just how underweight I was until then.

Now I’m 137, most of that weight gained in the last 3 months or so. Still very skinny but my arms already look less like twigs, I’m stronger, and overall beginning to feel a lot better about my self. It’s hard (especially with the pandemic) but I’m happy with my progress so far and can’t wait to go further.

"(Progress) M/18/5'11"" 145lbs to 161lbs This is my first post here and I think this is within the rules, but I am open to being corrected!

I wanted to make a post to encourage anyone else who is starting to lift and talk about my 10-month progress. I started lifting the first week of February and have been lucky enough to still have weights to lift during gym closures. Unfortunately, I do not have progress pics. It is enough that people have noticed I've been working out though.

**Height/Weight/Age**

Height: 5'11"" (Unchanged)

Weight: 145lbs to 161lbs

Age: 17 to 18

**Progress on B/S/D**

Bench - 115x5 to 210x1/180x6

Squat - 135x5 to 245x5

Deadlift - 185x5 to 280x5

**Weightlifting**

For me, 5x5 has easily been the most effective set/rep scheme for the big three lifts. I have tried 3x8 and some other high rep sets and nothing seems to work as well as sets of 5 heavy reps.  I have no doubt that higher reps work for some people, but 5x5 has worked well for me.

My week has been split into 4 days for the past few months. Days 1 and 3 are Chest/Shoulders/Tris and have flat barbell bench press (5x5) as the main movement. I then add dumbbell shoulder press (4x8), incline dumbbell press (3x8), lateral raises/reverse flyes (3x12), and cable flyes/tricep pushdowns (3x12). I cannot overemphasize the large benefits that tricep pushdowns have seemed to have for my bench press. Days 2 and 4 are Legs/Back/Biceps. Day 2 has the barbell back squat (5x5) as the main movement. It is followed by pendlay row (4x8), single-leg romanian deadlifts (3x12), lat pulldowns (3x12), and standing calf raise (3x15). Day 4 has the barbell deadlift (5x5) as the main movement. It is followed by one arm bent over dumbbell rows (4x8), bulgarian split squats (3x12), and bicep curls (3x12). I do pull-ups throughout every day, so I don't include them in the gym workouts. Do not neglect your back and legs! I know everyone wants bigger pecs and a nice bench, but you can't do it without a strong back and legs. 

**Nutrition**

I have made sure to get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day and then I just let the other macros fall wherever they fall. I have been eating 3300 to 3500 calories per day. I have found that cooking my own food I the best way to have controllable and steady progress.  I normally make eggs and have greek yogurt for breakfast every day and some sort of meat with rice/protein pasta for lunch on weekdays. My mom cooks dinner so that is different every night. I eat out on the weekends, but I am careful to eat healthy foods with good macros. Peanut butter has been one of the best tools for gaining weight in my experience. It has plenty of calories and is very easy to eat. I have one scoop of protein powder most days to help reach my goal.

**Conclusion**

Progress in the weight room can increase your confidence greatly. Don't let it be the only reason you're more confident of course. You simply have to eat, even when you don't want to if you want to gain weight. All of the muscles in your body work together in some way. Your squat can help you bench even though they train different parts of the body. Lifting weights is really simple for beginners like me. All you need to do is lift some heavy weight and you'll see progress.

I hope this is helpful for others on the same journey and I appreciate any and all comments!"
"Am I wasting nutrients by eating most of my macros in a single meal? Well, I've heard that the whole ""your body can only absorb about 30g of protein per meal"" is bs, but I'm wondering if maybe I'm pushing it too far.

Today, I got most of my macros from a single meal (pasta, turkey, broccoli and eggs if that matters), at about 1.800kcal and 110g of protein. The remaining nutrients I got from oatmeal and peanut butter at diner.

Am I wasting my protein? Is it fine if I continue with this ""one big meal, one small meal per day"" plan? Thank you and forgive my ignorance."

&amp;#x200B;

I already have some muscle in the before pic as I wasn't completely untrained at that point, but it's about 6 weeks after I started training again after I had my leg cast removed (ankle surgery). My story of starting out lifting is pretty similar to most guys, came out of a relationship, tall and super skinny guy who was underweight and I wanted to fix that. Bought a few dumbbells, started to toy around at home with bro splits. I gained a little bit of muscle but I tore the ligaments in my right ankle and required surgery. After the cast came off I had zero muscle left in my leg, and as I've had two ACL reconstructions and shoulder surgery after a torn labrum in the past I decided enough was enough, so I signed up to a gym and started doing the Reddit PPL. It kind of escalated from there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Workouts**

I ran the Reddit PPL for 6 months and saw a really good increase in muscle and strength. I have severe pectus for those who couldn't tell and my chest has always been a major weak point, both in size and strength. I really liked benching but 70kg was my absolute max and I wanted to improve that so I decided to go for a 5 day version of Nsuns with my accessory work focused on balanced hypertrophy. This was high volume and my body responded really well to it, I benched a 1RM of 90kg on NYE last year. I kept doing this and in april before gyms closed I did a really poor 160kg deadlift (no clue how I didn't injure myself) and a 62.5kg strict press.

While gyms were closed I did a 6 day per week home workout with a sloppy setup, some DBs and a pull up bar. I had occasional access to a gym to bench but my max dropped to 82.5kg and only my back saw a reasonable increase in size due to bb rows and weighted pull ups I could do at home. As soon as the gyms opened I went back to doing nSuns but injured my rotator cuff 3 weeks in. I decided powerlifting training wasn't worth it as my goal was a classic physique anyway, so I switched to a 6 day PPL I designed myself, I've since periodized that and still run that to this day. About 2 months ago I had a subluxation of my kneecap and I can no longer squat (I never really could anyway), so I changed my 2 leg days and I'm following Greg Nuckols 2 day intermediate deadlift right now because that's something I can do quite comfortably and I like doing it. Hope to hit the 200kg deadlift by the end of the year, not sure if possible but it's good to be ambitious.

**Nutrition**

My nutrition is relatively simple, I have and have had 0 issues maintaining strict discipline (be it nutrition or 6 day training regimes). The first lesson I learned is that I had to eat way, way, way more than I was doing. Right now after coming out of a cut (93kg -&gt; 87kg) I'm on 3850 kcal a day for a very slight surplus. I cycle a lot and I'm very tall, especially the latter seems to play a major part. I have 0 clue what BF% I am.

My macros are 90g fat, 270g protein and the rest carbs. A lot of veggies, dairy (I tolerate lactose super well) and high quality grains and rice make up the bulk of my diet. I very rarely have cheat meals. This won't work for most people but it is perfectly sustainable for me, I have been toying around with the macros a bit, at the end of the day the amount of calories is what's important.

**Lessons learned and future steps**

Things I've learned, might not necessarily be good advise for everybody.

* do what works for you, you have to enjoy it and be able to sustain it or it makes 0 sense. You want to train 2 days? Then train hard for 2 days, you're not doing this for a living
* form form form, learn to recognize injuries and learn how to prevent and treat them before they get too serious, get medical help if you're unsure
* find out what you respond well to, don't do things that hurt or simply don't seem to work. For aesthetics no 1 exercise is mandatory
* tailor generic programs to your needs, everybody needs different volumes and responds differently to certain impulses

For the future I'm going to slowly bulk up again trying to gain a little bit more strength. I'd like to experiment more with different bodybuilding style workouts and splits. I've been quite conservative and afraid to experiment and I'm definitely missing out here I think. I'm quite lean right now but I'd definitely like to fill out the front a bit more as it's not very impressive compared to my back (sorry don't have pictures of back).

Just hope to be some inspiration for the tall skinny guys."

After:https://ibb.co/BGjR8jY

I've always struggled to eat enough and I also have Crohn's, so my diet had to be adjusted for that.  I don't really like how restrictive it is, but it works and I haven't had a flare in months. 

Diet:

Breakfast- 100g tahini, canned sardines, A bar of dark chocolate (~1000 calories).

Lunch - 300g white rice, 150g ground beef/chicken, a cup of fruits. (~600 calories)

Dinner- same as lunch + 40g of hard cheese. (~700 calories)

Before bed- 160g coconut milk with honey (~350 calories)

Workout: 

Started with a standard PPL, 6 days split. After about a month I realized that I didn't have the time to train every day so I changed to a typical FBW. 

So that's about it I think. Overall, I am grateful can train, eat enough, and finally see some gains."
"Holidays Are Here: No Better Time Than Now For The ""Pan Of Cake A Day Diet""+Other Great Ideas In ""Eating Through The Sticking Points"" Howdy Gainers,

Before we begin, [this is the article that contains ""Eating Through The Sticking Point"" by Matt Reynolds, where the pan of cake a day is discussed among other ideas](https://startingstrength.com/article/eating_through_the_sticking_points)

I've shared this article before, but felt like it deserved particular focus, especially in this holiday season while we are surrounded by good food and ample opportunities to enjoy it.  The notion of ""eating through the sticking points"" comes by way of Hugh Cassidy, an OG Powerlifter that boasts numerous accomplishments, to include winning the first World Championship of powerlifting against giants such as Jim Williams and John Kuc by way of pulling a 790lb deadlift along with an 800lb squat and a 570lb bench, all without powerlifting supportive equipment.  

Cassidy's idea was a simple and effective one: the weights you lift are proportional to your own bodyweight.  If your bodyweight goes UP, the proportion improves.  If you weigh 100lbs and try to bench 400lbs, it's a 4x bodyweight bench.  Bring your bodyweight up to 200 and it's 2x.  Bring it up to 300 and it's 1.5x.  Etc.  It was not uncommon for trainees under Cassidy to put on 3lbs in between workouts in order to come back and crush previous poundages.


[Bruce Randall](https://www.chaosandpain.com/tips/tips-anybody-can-get-lean-bulk-first-then-worry-about-your-abs-the-story-of-bruce-randall/) had similar observations as well, and utilized that approach to become a champion weightlifter AND THEN went on to become a champion bodybuilder.  As, once again, it proves true that fat is FAR easier to lose than muscle is to gain.

As we endeavor in our quest to gain muscle, remember these options afforded you.  If things are stalling in the weight room, you can manipulate programming and do all sorts of tricks and hacks, but one of the first instincts as a gainer should be to eat through the sticking points."
"If you struggle with eating, and you don’t cook your own food, you should start Hey guys!

I’ve always been extremely underweight because I’ve struggled with eating food in general, because I saw it as more of a chore than anything else. I love to eat food that I love, but my mother would usually cook for me, and I’d just end up not finishing my food. The same applies for university, where I’d eat from the dining hall, but I would struggle to finish it, *for whatever reason.*

In any case, I was forced to sustain myself for a week—I bought myself my groceries and spices, and I essentially just planned through my entire week. Today was the first day that I actually cooked for myself, and for breakfast, I followed a very simple recipe online, but I put my own twist on it (because I prefer to use my own spice profile). After finishing cooking and I finally got to eat it... it was actually so delicious! I kept eating and eating, and I had to stop myself from eating any more. For dinner I freestyled a bit, but the same principle applied: I cooked for myself, I enjoyed it a lot, and I ate so much I had to stop myself. 

This seems obvious to say, but **enjoying your food** goes a long way in how much of it you’re willing to eat. If you don’t cook for yourself, you should learn! Nobody knows what you like to eat better than yourself. And if you do cook for yourself, but you find yourself struggling to motivate yourself to eat your food, perhaps try changing it up! Use different spices, change the way you cook, follow some recipes, take some classes, whatever helps you enjoy your food more! Eating 2500+ calories a day seemed insurmountable to me at first, but just eating today’s food made it seem incredibly easy. 

Clearly, this doesn’t apply to everyone, and this may seem very obvious to some of you guys, but I know that there are a couple of people who are slower on this than myself. So, I just wanted to share this piece of advice. 

Good luck out there!"
"Deserts and sweets during gaining? How does deserts and sweets affect your gain it experience? Is it more important to get calories than choosing a more healthier option? Will it slow down my muscle growth progress?

"(Progress) F/21/5’4” - 95lbs to 125lbs Over one year ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/bmrz4q/f1954_95lbs_to_111lbs_5_months/) about my weight gain journey, and received a lot of encouragement, so I thought I'd make a follow up!

This is me [then](https://imgur.com/a/sDndF6N) (about two years ago) and [now](https://imgur.com/a/5Ke6NBI).

I still strive to be in the gym 4-5 days per week and it has become a passion of mine. It's stress relief, and time I put aside to do something for me and me alone. When I first started working out it wasn't my intention to be the biggest or the strongest, and it still isn't. I just wanted to look more ""normal"", but now I really enjoy the feeling of knowing I'm getting stronger and my hard work is paying off.

For workouts I still follow a push/pull/legs split. One thing I focus on much more now is spending time on compound movements, especially the big three. My squat has always been held back by mild congenital hip dysplasia so it's been a bit harder for me to grow my quads. My PRs aren't great, but its a huge accomplishment to me anyways, because I remember where I started. 2 years ago I could barely curl 10 lbs in one hand and couldn't bench the bar.

As far as diet, I pretty much eat healthy-ish, and focus on getting in good protein. Protein was the key for me to gaining and also to maintaining. I don't track calories or macros anymore. My weight has been very consistent for a while now, apart from minor fluctuations.

Overall I'm much more confident now than two years ago. I also feel healthier and better overall. I was always tired and low energy at 95 lbs. I remember it used to hurt to sit for too long because of my bones having no cushion, and my posture was terrible because those muscle groups were so underdeveloped. And I didn't have success immediately in the gym, I was very self conscious and insecure, due to lack of knowledge and experience on top of my scrawniness. But I just dove in head first and read as much as I could from places like this. I've learned a ton since then, and now I am confident enough to help friends who are wanting to start getting in the gym.

Anyways, thats where I am at now. There's not really an end goal in sight, except to be a better version of myself today than I was yesterday."

Post workout meal? If I have a big meal before I work out do I need to have a post workout meal?
How often do you guys go to the grocery store? I find myself having to go almost every week with how much I’m eating now. Well more accurately convincing my mom to go every week. Seems kinda excessive but that’s coming from someone who hardly ever used to eat.
"What am I doing wrong? So I’ve steadily been increasing my reps with the same weight and finally got to 12 in my bench presses on the first set. The rest are drop sets and I decrease by 5 lbs for two more sets. Last chest day looked like 12.8.12 as I do bench presses first. However, Today I decided to add 5 lbs to the bar and I was only able to perform 3 reps! Then 4 on the second drop set and 9 on the third. 

What gives? Shouldn’t I have been able to do a lot more? Like at least 7 or 8? Is it all in my head and I’m letting the new weight intimidate me? Or am I crazy and this is supposed to be my new starting point?

"Gaining Wait For No Apparent Reason, Muscle or Fat?

I got to about 175 pounds and stopped working out as hard about 2 weeks ago. Since then I have been eating decently and going to the gym for full body and basketball. Now I am 181 and don't know if it is fat or muscle. I don't know why I gained so much weight during this time period, and what should I do to not lose my gains and lose some weight?

"What’s the best time to eat alot? I’ve heard that eating at night hits alot, just wanted to confirm from you expert gentleman"
"We don't realize how little we eat until we start tracking it I was absolutely sure I ate a lot. I always felt full and I ate a lot of rice, potatoes etc.
Bit I just couldn't gain weight and muscle gain was just not happening for me.
So I decided to put what I ate in the past few days in a calorie tracker and was shocked.
I only eat 1200 to 1400 calories a day!
And I don't get enough healthy fats, at all.

That is honestly way less than I expected and I made an effort to eat a bit more today. Couldn't finish my lunch, but I ate more than normal.

Eating enough to actually gain weight is honestly a lot harder than I thought it was.
Doesn't help that my mother comments on every single pound I gain calling me fat lol.

Anyways, time for my work out. I can only do 5 pushups and I'm going to change that now 💪"

"(Long post) Why am I Not Gaining? (29F, 5'1 126lb). Advice needed for gaining back lost muscle I need advice on my current fitness regime and how it can be improved! Sorry for the super long post but here we go! 

I started working out 8 years ago when I was 21 and put on muscle very quickly. I competed in two bodybuilding shows in 2014 &amp; 2015 in bikini. After both shows I rebounded and ended up gaining about 25lbs in about 2 months. Fortunately I continued lifting heavy and made serious gains during these rebounds. I bulked for about a year after my last show and then stayed in a maintenance phase until 2018, still lifting heavy. I looked very muscular for my size (5'1) and it was extremely noticeable that I worked out, even during ""bulking"". At my heaviest I was around 128lbs. 

In 2018 I started intermittent fasting to cut weight for an upcoming event. I had really great results and stayed in a deficit for a while. I cut down to about 112lbs and looked really great with all of that muscle. I have struggled in the I past with disordered eating and bullemia. I got extremely comfortable being lean and kept pushing myself more and more to lose more weight. I was still working out but eating very little and infrequently. Then in 2019 I started dealing with extreme anxiety and depression due to other factors, I stopped working out for almost an entire month and sometimes went a few days eating absolutely nothing. I had virtually no appetite and was constantly stressed. I didn't notice myself shrinking at first. Once I hit 102lbs I kinda just realized pretty much all of my muscle vanished. I'm ashamed I let it happen because I know better. I'm disappointed in myself and hate seeing myself in the mirror. 

So here we are now. I've slowly been adding in more calories since January 2020 and have worked my way up to 3000 cal/day. Right now I am around 126lbs. I've been lifting about 3-4 times/week. I try my best to go 4-5 days but I am in school and work full time so my time is very limited. I feel like I'm having issues gaining my muscle back - especially my GLUTES. I also started working at a more sedentary job in 2019 and I really started to notice lower back pain during my leg workouts. I now realize that from sitting all day I likely have glute amnesia. I now have a standing desk and stand most of my workday. I am working from home and doing school from home so unfortunately I don't get much daily activity. My metabolism seems to be on fire. Any day that I eat under 3000 cal I wake up feeling lean and deflated (which is not my goal right now). This has made gaining weight and muscle has been challenging. I'm putting on some muscle, but not as quickly as I did before. 

I am natural, no enhancement drugs or steroids. I smoke cannabis every night to stimulate my appetite. For supplements I take bcaas and protein powder. I'm trying to be more consistent with incorporating creatine but I've been forgetting often. I go to physiotherapy, chiropractor, and massage therapy all to help my lower back and glute issues. My workouts are a 5 day split with 3 leg days and 2 upper body days. I am still progressively overloading and adding weight every week. I do heavy compound lifts (225 sumo deadlift, 175 squat, &amp; 85 bench). I just feel like I was able to gain mass so much quicker when I was 21 vs 29 and its extremely depressing that I've set myself back so much. As I get older I also am way more prone to aches and pains which makes lifting a challenge at times. Also during quarantine I did my best to continue lifting heavy at home, but unfortunately my appetite vanished once again and I stopped eating as much as I had been. I've been consistent with my eating and lifting since July once gyms opened in my province. I still just feel like I'm so far behind what I was and I don't feel my gains are coming back. 

Does anyone have any advice regarding my current regime and situation? I'm at a complete loss as to why I'm not progressing. Is this just what happens when you get old? I was really counting on my muscle memory to kick in at some point. TIA for all advice!"
"Has anyone here successfully bulked on an AIP diet? Basically I’ve been having stomach pains for a long while, and my doctor put me on an AIP diet (Auto immune protocol - for those who don’t know, it’s basically a more strict version of the paleo diet). Stomach pains have disappeared, I see my doctor again soon, and hopefully I don’t have to stick to this diet. 

If I do have to stay on this diet for the rest of my life, is it even possible to bulk? I found out yesterday that I can’t even eat potatoes. Quite frustrating, because I’ve been consistently doing the basic beginner routine for some weeks and making progress with my lifts. 

Any advice would be appreciated"
"Frustrated with at-home workout equipment Hi everyone,

I'm getting frustrated with options for at-home workout equipment, specifically for glutes. I'm living in an apartment and don't have the space for a squat rack (I will in about a year but that's a long time away), and I'm kinda hitting the upper limit of what I can do with resistance bands. I'm still pretty weak in my upper body/arms so I'm set for a while there (lol), but I'm plateauing on my legs. 

Would anyone have any suggestions?? I'm nervous about handling a barbell without a squat rack with anything besides deadlifts. (I'm specifically looking to bulk my glutes up a bit too... I can do a *lot* with them but they don't really look like it so I do want something that'll be easy to keep making harder.)"

"Horrible forearm pain from curls I'm just starting Greyskull LP. I get horrible forearm pain in both of my arms from curls, and I was curious if there was an alternative bicep exercise that might lead to less pain (or if I should just leave bicep exercises out of my plan for now). I went to my doctor maybe 6 years ago about this when I first tried gaining weight in highschool, and he basically said I have tennis elbow in both of my arms. Unfortunately, every time I've tried gaining weight since then I have experienced this problem. I still haven't found a solution for it. I'm thinking right now that I should just leave bicep workouts out of my plan so I don't destroy my forearm muscles, but I wanted to get any advice you guys might have about this.  


Some info about my pain, I experience it both post-workout and during the workout when I release the weights. For some reason the act of releasing the weights after I finish my reps causes horrible, sharp pain in my forearm. The pain lingers after my workout is done, and as I type this my forearms are killing me :("
"How many of you actually adhere to macros when bulking? I'm getting a lot of different advice, figured I'd see what you guys do. 

I'm personally having a hard time not with bulking but staying within the macros. Someone I know who is in great shape told me that he doesn't bother tracking macros when bulking, he simply makes sure that he's getting the right amount of protein he needs but that's it. 

I've gotten meal plans, I've gotten low fat foods, and it seems like regardless of what I do, I'm always over the goal for fat. Still get an appropriate amount of protein and carbs, but the fat is irritating me. 

How about your guys?"

"Skinny guy wants some advice on how to gain mass the right way So as the title mentions: i've been a skinny guy for a while now, It wasn't always like this, I use to weight around 75-80kgs when I was 16 and fell into some ""Bad Habits"" since then I weight around 54/56.Now I know its not because i'm someone with some godly metabolism, Its because I under-eat, Frankly I find it rought on my budget to have enough meals to bulk up the way I want, So I was wondering if you guys could lend me some advice.

Im just not sure if just going hard on training is going to help me gain mass when all ill be doing is just trimming, what is already basically bone.

"[Progress] M/36/5'4: 125 - 160 lb I joined the gym in May 2017 and I recently found a picture of myself before going to the gym while scrolling through my phone. The difference between then and how I look currently is stark, and frankly surprised me. Thought y'all might enjoy.

[125 vs 160 lbs](https://imgur.com/a/TQlR37G) 

### Programs

I initially made my own linear progression, and did that for approximately 8 months maybe more? I dunno, in that range. I won't detail it because it was dumb. Don't do that. Follow literally any other linear progression and it will be better. I went from 125 - 150 lb, then back down to 138 lb during that time. After that I switched to u/utben free intermediate program for 3 rounds, all my lifts exploded and I went from 138 - 156 lb. (*People are asking for the program. To save you looking in the comments, you can find it here https://peakhd.net/p/free-intermediate-program). Amazing what intelligent programming can do. Then I did 1 round of Megazord by u/BeanchPauper, which took me into end of last year and up to 159 lb. 

I ignored conditioning during that time like a dummy, so I thought January would be good to get some of my base back and ran Tactical Barbell 2 base building, which has no heavy lifting in it whatsoever. Right at the end of that, lockdown happened, leaving me to my own devices and sitting at 155 lb. I made a 66 lb and 100 lb sandbag, did what I could with them for a month and a half, then ran a bastardized Deep Water beginner and Intermediate with them. I remained at 155 lb for the entirely of lock down. I didn't lift heavy from January until about September of this year as a result.

About a week or two after that I managed to piece enough of my home gym together to lift at home in Septemberish I believe and started the reddit novice program to get my feet wet again. I'm still running that and setting rep prs, which is both odd and fantastic to me. I am sitting at 160 lb currently.

### Lifts

All time tested: 345/210/435/135 in December 2019

Current:

Squat: 280 x 7

Bench: 195 x 7

Deadlift: 355 x 8

OHP: 110 x 7

### Diet

I eat consistently, and as a result, I don't count calories. When I want to increase weight I increase the size of individual meals by approximately 250 equivalent calories chunks and see if I'm budging the scale. So as an example, I might add a cup of rice to dinner or I may change my protein shake to having milk and peanut butter in it. When that stops working, I'll add to a different meal. Conversely, when I want to lose weight, I'll do the opposite. 

Typical current daily diet:

Breakfast 1: Beet smoothie (cup of frozen beets, cup of frozen mixed berries/pomegranate, fresh orange juice) + separate 2 scoop protein shake with 1 cup milk and 2 T peanut butter.

Breakfast 2: 4 boiled eggs

Lunch: 150g cold cut sandwich (mortadella, prosciutto, turkey breast, whatever) with greens, onions, tomatoes and mayo.

Dinner: 1/2 lb meat (all sorts of fatty meats), bunch of veggies, 2 cups rice. 

I haven't bothered to calculate how many calories this is, because I find it unnecessary to know. 

If anyone wants to know how I specifically worked up to eating this, ask me and I'd be happy to detail it.  

### Lessons

There's no fucking chance you could have told 125 lb me that I'd ever be this big. I absolutely would have not believed it and called you a liar. I honestly thought I didn't have the genetics to support that, my metabolism was way too high and that I was started at too old an age. All of that is clearly garbage, and if you find yourself thinking like that, stop. It doesn't even matter if it's true or not, because regardless, you can blast past those limitations with time, consistency and trying. Hell, I didn't even do shit correctly in the beginning, made up my own lp and it still worked out just fine.  

### Goals that I'm working towards:

I'd like to hit a 500 lb deadlift and suspect I'll have to get up to 175ish lb to do that. I'd also like to run a half marathon in 2 hours because fuck everyone who thinks I can't, and my athletic endeavors run mostly on spite damn it!"
"(M27) I'm 126 pounds but I look 110. I just want to be able to fill out a t-shirt. Never been in the gym, what is the best program for me to achieve that goal? Pic  [Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/NPWe5vw) 

I'm super skinny and I've realized I mostly wear hoodies to hide how skinny I am. There's so many programs it's confusing, can someone recommend a good one that I would see the most benefits from as a beginner?

I'm thinking of getting a trainer my first couple of times in the gym so I can make sure I'm using proper form. Is that recommended or do most people just go in and start by themselves?"
"How I made my training more bearable Hey I wanted to share three mistakes I made in my first 2 years of lifting and how I stayed at a pretty beginner level the whole time as a result of it. This is just personal so I have 0 clue if it will work but if your training isn't going where you want it try it out. 

1) I tried training 5-6 days a week, 

as a result of having this goal I usually only made it to 4 days and would beat myself up over missing that 5th day and anytime I did lift 5 days a week I would be wiped the next week and feel terrible missing more workouts and feeling worse about it. I switched to working out 4 days a week and it keeps the gym fresh and fun and keeps me super motivated to push myself to the limit every time I'm there which I think is key as I got complacent after feeling like I'm always in the gym.


2)  I chose weight as the first way to add resistance, 

Personally, this has caused 99.99% of all injuries I have occurred and I think so many lifters are guilty of this. The thing is I didn't even feel like I was ego lifting but rather as soon as I would crank out 8 reps at X weight id automatically increase maybe 5-10 pounds. Personally, this caused a lot of weight on my joints despite having reviewed and videotaped my form it just felt like it took a toll on me and as a guy in my early 20's that's a scare. 

Instead I really ""mastered"" each rep and I know it sounds cheesy but I do 5 sets of 12-15 strict reps with an extremely slow decline and you'll be able to lift 1/2 of the weight you used to and will feel like it took 120% of the effort you used to use to lift the old heavier weight. This has caused my gains to explode over a short 8 month period when compared to about 2 years of lifting the older way. In addition to this I added weighted calisthenics to this and you'll die trying to do 5X15 weighted pull-ups and dips esp if you go so slow on the decline. 

Also on the injury's side, all my nagging pains have gone away even on my problem exercises (now I also do physio and stretch a lot this new style has just not regressed my injuries its not fixing them actively I am).



3) I didn't address my injuries and take the time I needed off and worked too many front exercises

If your shoulder is nagging you then stop working out your shoulder replace it with cardio in your workouts or whatever you want. The point is immediately stop and start rehabbing and stretching the muscle and come back and start resistance bands if you can do those for a week or 2 start back in SLOWLY on the exercises I usually do 1/2 the weight and 1/2 the reps just to get the blood in there the goal is just to rehab without snapping something and having to take 8-16 months off vs 1. Lastly I worked so many chest exercises and front delts and realized I'm completely neglecting my back and it caused SO MANY muscular imbalances and injures and was a big hole in my physique too hit your rows like crazy and those rear delts I like to do 2 pulls for every push movement.



Again these were my thoughts I figured it might be good to consider lmk

"Should I try to lose body fat before trying to put on muscle mass? Hey r/gainit

I (22M) have recently decided that I want to start back up with the gym and try to build my muscle mass up some (the whole global pandemic thing kind of put it on the back burner for me for a little while). I've always considered myself a skinny guy, and before the world went crazy this year I was fairly active (college student, walking 5-8 miles every day and working out 4-5x days per week) when it came to putting on weight. I didn't have much of a plan or super strict diet at the time, but managed to go from 125 to 140 before the lockdown hit (I'm 5'8"" for reference).

However, between being at home and not living the same lifestyle that I was back on campus, I've put on a fair amount of weight, and not the good kind. I'm up to just under 160lbs, which would be great if it were lean muscle, but its definitely mostly fat as a result of my more sedentary lifestyle. The body fat calculators that I've looked at have clocked me in at a little under 20%, which is far from where I want to be. I've been incorporating more cardio into my day-to-day routines to trim this down some, and have been trying to eat healthier food and less calories, but considering I'm hoping to get back in the gym anyway, I'm wondering if I should seek to lose some of this body fat before I start trying to put on muscle mass, or if I should just go for it anyway and hope it gets evened out as I try to focus more on building muscle. I'm new to the more technical aspects of dieting and exercise planning, so I'm just trying to figure out the best way to approach this.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"Unsure of how I will gain 30+ lbs without getting fat I’ve been lifting weights seriously for around 2 years now, and I’ve always had a problem with bulking. I’ve dieted down to pretty lean levels (9-10%) with ease, but I always seem to stop my mass gaining phases quickly because I just look so much worse. I’ve tried a lean bulk with only 1lb per week gained, and even then I was looking much softer and chubbier in the face. I’m around 160 lbs right now, 5’ 11“, and I have no idea how I will be able to reach 190 lbs or so if I continue my extremely slow bulk.

How did your grocery bill change? Is it much harder to get calories now? 

How do you feel?"
"How big of a factor is digestion when trying to gain muscle? I have been lifting hard using mostly an upper/lower routine focused on compounds but am still moving very low weights even tho I've been taking fitness seriously for 1.5 years now.

I try to push myself to lift more weights/reps every workout, have eaten at a surplus for 9 months which just made me fatter but barely any stronger. After my unsuccessful bulk attempt I cut down again which probably was a good choice, I didn't lose what little strength I had. 

I have a few problems with my shoulder and lower back so I've been doing daily PT and stretching so I can go back to deadlifting and overhead pressing.

But another issue I've had for a very long time is the fact that my body seems to have problems digesting the foods I consume. Around the same time I started stalling more frequently I also started having issues with low energy, brain fog, dizziness and other weird issues.

I've always felt like I must've been doing something wrong when trying to gain muscle which lead to my poor progress, even tho I followed all the basic knowledge like lifting hard, frequently, eating and sleeping a lot, trying to improve technique etc.

Do you think my problems in the gym could be related to my other health issues or do I just have poor genetics or need to optimize my training/sleeping/diet even more?"
