&lt;p&gt;So I am moving to germany in one month and I wanted to ask what foods I can buy that are cheap and will help me keep gaining weight. At the moment I am not lifting weights because the pandemic situation but I am kind of enjoying the dad bod that I got from stopping lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I can slowly feel how I am losing weight because I am naturally skinny and if I dont eat enough, I will go back to skeleton me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a male, 29y.o. I used to weight around 90kg when I lifted weights but when the pandemic started I had to stop and now I am at around 82kg and slowly decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is more addresed to people from Germany but obviously anyone can comment. I thank you for your comments.&lt;/p&gt;

Age: 20, Sex: Male, Height: 5'10, Weight: 135-138 lbs, natural

Experience: Started seriously working out since September 2020, stopped between November till end of Jan due to personal issues. Restarted in Feb in a proper gym and have good form in main lifts such as Bench, OHP, Squart, and DL. In my 3 months or so of serious training I have gained significant progress and people have noted my size difference.

Main goals: Increase size and strength. Mix of hypertrophy and strength. But mostly appreciate aesthetics.

Current Maxes:

Bench: 125 lbs for 3 reps ( can be done for about 3 sets given 2 warmup sets and 2 sets of 115 lbs)

Deadlift: 145 lbs. Can continue to increase, not sure where my limit is but slowly increasing to avoid injury

Squat: 135 lbs. Slowly increasing, can do 3 set of 7 reps given warmup sets and others

Overhead Press: 75 lbs, slowly increasing. Can do 4 sets of 5 with prior warmup

Question regarding LM Bulking Routine:

1. I understand the exercises that are on the program, but I was wondering whether I can modify it to fit my 6 days a week workout schedule. I am also unsure about what weight to use for the workout and how to increase. For example, what should I start with now and how much should I increase per week?
2. I noticed there aren't any ab exercises in this program. I therefore assigned Wednesday's rest day as the designated abs day
3. Stiffleg deadlifts vs regular deadlifts?
4. Any app recommendations to store this program on? I am currently using the Gymshark app. But would appreciate maybe an app that contains a ""weeks"" function and another function that alters your set weights based on new max PRs.

,gainit,"Hey guys, I'm a girl in my 20s. I weigh 130lbs. Im 5'7"". I'm basically skinny fat. My butt is small but round, just not super muscular and firm. Most of my excess fat is localized in my love handles. It's really not a lot and I look skinny in clothes but I just want to be more muscular. I figure body recomp is probably useless for me because it'll take a lot longer for me to gain muscle and lose the fat.

My TDEE is about 2000 calories (I eat a lot and am always hungry so I guess I have a fast metabolism). So I think I should bulk, at about 100 or 150 caloric surplus. My question is, if I successfully gain muscle during this bulk (for about 3 or 4 months) will I lose the stubborn love handle fat naturally, just as a result of having more muscle (since muscle burns more calories at rest??). 

Also, will I gain a lot of fat during a bulk for this period of time? I don't eat processed food, refined sugar, etc.  I strictly eat paleo with the exception of potatoes to control the symptoms of my autoimmune disease. Lots of protein, lots of greens, etc.

,gainit,"BACKGROUND &amp; GOALS: I am a classic case of skinny-fat (very little muscle due to previous irresponsible crash dieting with very little weight training experience in the past, 16% body fat, look terrible with fat concentrated on my belly).

,gainit,"From August 2019-September 2020 I did little to no consistent training. I went from 230ish to 170 at my lowest. Coming back to training was really hard, and I sympathize with you if you are restarting after losing everything. I want you to know that although you may  THINK have lost all of your muscle and strength gains, they are still there just laying dormant. Years of training results in additional satellite cells being created and etched into your muscles that stick around for *decades*. 

I was 175 when I started back up. The first time I came back to the gym, I was warming up to squat and [fell backwards on my ass almost every set.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEIRK8uA7i-/?igshid=13gd8vqnv96wb) I was so mad at myself and my body. I knew how to squat in my mind, but my body just didn't have the skill anymore, it had to be redeveloped. I wasn't even as close to upset at how little weight I could move compared to actually not being able to squat. Be nice to yourself when you come back, you know how to do it, but you need to be patient with your body as it relearns. 

It has been 6ish months since I have returned to lifting and I have already set lifetime PRs and gained all of the weight I lost back. In fact, I am 245 now and that is also a lifetime PR. Here is what I did the first 2 and half months and my advice for returning to the gym:

**DO NOT test your maxes**

After I realized my body lost a ton of motor patterns, I was so upset, it is such a bad feeling. On top of that, I knew I was weak. To help protect my ego, I refused to learn my maxes on lifts, it would only cause more harm to me mentally. Ignorance is definitely bliss when you're starting again from scratch, and you have no business pushing yourself to the max at this point. You will thank yourself for choosing to ignore the truth at this time later down the road, I promise.

**Accumulate work capacity**

This should be your number one priority. Your tolerance for work capacity has dropped so far down and you need to ease back into it. Go very slow! Do not jump in the deep end right away, you have no business running a 6 day routine with 5-7 exercises a day, 2 exercises a day and some light conditioning will take you far at this stage. 

**Focus on practicing**

Those motor patterns that are 'gone' are still there, just dormant. You cannot force or rush this phase, it is a process. Focus each training session around a compound movement and do not go anywhere close to failure. You should barely be straining at first, your muscles need to relearn the movement and you need to focus on coordination. Trying to build muscle at this point is asinine and not what we are after. Your body is terribly inefficient at moving weight again but will regrow exponentially faster than the first time if you do it the right way. Keeping it light without a ton of volume is perfect, that way you get more practice than muscle damage. 

**High frequency, low intensity low volume per session**

I originally said low volume, but that's really not true on a weekly basis. I lifted everyday, but only did 2 exercises of 4-6 sets of 6-10 reps. This is all you need at first and I promise it will set you up for success. You will not be stuck training like this for long.

**How to pick weights** 

I recommend you read easy strength by dan john, as this had a lot of influence on my returning to training.

This was very simple for me, just pick a weight that used to be your first or second warmup set. It should be extremely light, like lighter than you are probably thinking right now. You can do more with light weight, you can put more force into the bar than required or change the tempo to make it more difficult. F=ma, there I just proved it scientifically. If you choose a weight that's too heavy, not only can you not do these things, but you also don't have room to progress and you might end up missing. 

**How to progress**

The first month I used a very simple double progression model, which is to say you don't increase load until 2 variables are achieved. For example, say my deadlift day starts at 3x6 (which it did). The next session I'd do 4x6. The session after that I'd do 4x8, then 5x8, followed by 5x10. Only after I reached 5x10 on an exercise would I add weight and reset to 3x6. And I usually only added 10lbs each time I reset back to 3x6. The second month, start adding in hard conditioning, hill sprints and 60/120s are my go to and will always be a staple for me. I recommend you go easy on conditioning at first though.

**When to stop and move on**

You'll know you're ready when you are confident enough to test your maxes. 2.5 months back for me was enough. I tested my maxes and about 85% of my strength was back. 

Returning after a layoff can feel daunting and is a dreadful experience, but you will pick up where you left off in a very fast time frame. You'll get those gains back so fast that you'll feel like you're on steroids. [This](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFA6RWOgKqC/?igshid=pbpl1bae3ogd) is only a few months away from [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLzvb0sAz87/?igshid=1lsfrtu2ciw55).

It’s funny because come to think of it, after my first serious girlfriend broke up with me, I remember doing a summer xc hill workout soon after and practically the same thing happening. Stress and the burden it holds can really mess up something seemingly routine in terms of your fitness imo&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hey r/gaintit,

I've been following this subreddit since November and in January, I finally started to do something about my lack of gains. January 1st, I was 150 lbs, and I'm 6'3. I take in roughly 2800-3000 calories a day. I do push/pull/legs twice a week and Sunday is rest day. I now weight 165 lbs and have been seeing some solid gains.

Since starting, I've been able to see results everywhere EXCEPT my chest. My chest feels stronger if I press it but in terms of mass size, it doesn't look any different. I currently do - dumbbell bench press, dumbbell incline bench press, inclined chest flyes and push ups (regular and wide). Push ups seem to be the only exercise where I feel my chest after the work outs, the rest feel like it works my traps more than anything.

Wanted to ask - is this normal? Is chest harder to see gains than other muscle groups? Should I try other exercises or could something be off with my form?

General info - I do not have access to a gym and probably won't for a few more months. No dip station and can't make a home one either with the stool chairs I have in my apartment. Have access to a workout bench, pull up bar, two dumbbells that go up to 40 lbs each (which I can bench press for 3x12, albeit I'm winded after) and tensions bands.

**Background:** I’ve always been small. 5’9 &amp; 140lbs. I boxed for 4 years but didn’t weight train, I decided to start lifting weights after I got diagnosed with a detached retina. 

It was a lot to learn, and I started off barely benching the bar. Even though it was embarrassing to be at the gym, I still went. 

I bulked to 160lbs during my first year, and continued cutting/bulking cycles. (This is very ineffective, and looking at my physique today, I realize that.) 

In 2019, I got deployed and dropped to my lowest weight ever at 138lbs when it was all said and done. Upon returning home I immediately got back in the gym, and muscle memory hit me like a train. Within a month I was back to 160lbs &amp; I’m currently fluctuating between 175-180lbs

MUSCLE MEMORY IS A DRUG! (I wasn’t even necessarily bulking when I came home, I was eating out constantly and just enjoying myself, but my training was very serious.) 

Overall Transformation (More at the bottom.) : [Imgur link ](https://imgur.com/gallery/5lBqwbA)

 
**Stats:** 5'9"", Male, SW 140LB, CW 180LB

**Lift Progress:** I’m aware I’m not very strong, my numbers should be higher for someone who’s trained for 4 years. But I like to focus on bodybuilding vs powerlifting. There is no shame in that! I stopped worrying about numbers a couple years ago, and I am much happier now that I don’t have that weight on my shoulders. 

**Bench:** 65LB &gt; 245LB (no lie, I barely could do the bar. My first max was legitimately 65lbs) 

**Squat:** 95LB &gt; 315LB

**Deadlift:** 135LB &gt; 375LB

**OHP:** 45LB &gt; 135LB (Most impressive in my opinion, OHP utilizes much more than just shoulder strength! Good technique can get you stronk) 

**Diet:** I tracked calories using the infamous MyFitnessPal app. I started at 2700 cals, &amp; slowly transitioned into 3200 cals. Eating this many calories has always been difficult for me, I thought I was a “hardgainer” but then I realized I was using that as an excuse as to why I’m not hitting my goals. My most successful way of thinking was forcing myself to eat 1000 cals in the morning, &amp; 800 for lunch. Dinner was easy to get calories in, because I could consume 500 cals before the gym, and whatever remained I could fit in after the gym. 

IF YOU’RE BULKING: Breakfast is a HUGE indicator on how your day will go. If you can wake up 30 mins earlier than normal, you’ll have more time to cook quality food and put a dent into the days calories. My favorite breakfast was always: 6 scrambled eggs, 2 Kodiak Pancakes, a bowl of strawberries, &amp; 2 packets of oatmeal. 

Lunch: Usually 8-12oz of chicken breast and 1 cup of rice. With a side of steamed broccoli (thank you instant pot) 

Dinner (Pre Gym): 1 pack of ramen (the sodium gives you joocy pumps.) And a banana (cus helth.) 

Post Gym: 2 scoops of protein shake (50g of protein.)

Dinner (Post Gym): Pasta noodles &amp; ground beef or steak. (Depends what I have time to cook) 

**If I didn’t hit my required calories, I would make my homemade mass gainer shake. 

MY MASS GAINER RECIPE:
-2 scoops of protein
-1 cup oats
-1 spoon of Peanut Butter 
-1/2 banana (eat the other half, it’s just a yummy snack) 
This amounted to approximately 700-800 cals, depending on your protein. 


**Routine:**

I’ve pretty much followed PPL for my whole lifting career. I tried nSuns for a bit, but I didn’t like doing 8sets of power lifts. I was more focused on doing bodybuilding movements. I’ve never done anything out of the ordinary with my training, it’s always been pretty basic and just use what I had at my gym.  


PUSH DAY: 
5x5 Bench Press (FLAT) 

4x12 Bench Press (INCLINE) 

4x15 Pec Deck (Fly’s)

4x10 Chest Press

4x10 Lying Dumbbell Skullcrushers (I noticed I get more activation out of my triceps by using dumbbells versus a EZ bar or barbell.)

4x12 Rope Push Down

4x10 Reverse Pull Down (Use a bar for these and grip the bar underhand, this is my favorite triceps exercise. I’ve never felt activation quite like this.)


PULL DAY
5x5 Deadlifts 

4x10 Barbell Row

3x10 Good Morning (usually after the 3rd set my lower back is like “nah fam” so I rarely went over 3 sets) 

4x10 Lat Pulldown 

4x10 Cable Row 

4x12 Bicep Curls

4x7 Hammer Curls (HEAVY)

4x10 Incline Dumbbell Curls 

4x21 21’s (great to finish off with.)

4x10 Rear Delt Fly


LEG DAY (.. and shoulders)
5x5 Barbell Squat

4x8 Front Squat 

4x10 Leg Press

4x15 Leg Extension (go light, work the eccentric motion. Try to take pressure off your knees, this exercise is notorious for wrecking knees.)

4x12 Hamstring Curl (go light, focus on the SQUEEZE, if you do these right you may have Charlie horses that night in bed. ) 🥴

5x5 Overhead Press 

4x15 Side Lateral Raise 

4x15 Front Raise (Dumbbell) 


***TIPS***

Buying a crock pot / instant pot is a game changer. I could throw a roast or even a steak in the crock pot, let it cook on low while I slept. And when I woke up, I had a fresh meal ready to go! 

DON’T WEIGH YOURSELF EVERYDAY (this can be counterproductive when you get tunnel vision on a number. I weigh myself on Mondays / Thursdays.. And always weigh yourself at the same time everyday. First thing in the morning is best, before you eat.) 

Getting in calories immediately after the gym is an easy way to hit your calorie numbers. Your body is taxed and can absorb more food right after (jk Idk if that’s even true but that’s what I tell myself🤔) nah but for real, it’s always easier for me to get in calories right after the gym, so I usually double scoop a protein shake. 

Creatine is your friend, take creatine. No you don’t have to hand in your natty card, and it won’t cause you to behave any differently. But it does retain water and help you become more “full looking” 

GET BLOODWORK DONE! Usually bloodwork is only recommended if your cycling steroids, but you NEED TO KNOW if your body is producing enough Test, and if certain supplements are needed for your diet!! 


Alright.. what everyone comes for.. here are the..

Current @ 180lbs: [Imgur link 5](https://imgur.com/gallery/sbEFUwK)",t2_x4ykf,False,,0,False,M (140LB &gt; 180LB) 25 Years Old - 4 Year Progress Report,[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_ly198v,False,dark,0.93,,public,53,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,53,,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614938245.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve always been small. 5’9 &amp;amp; 140lbs. I boxed for 4 years but didn’t weight train, I decided to start lifting weights after I got diagnosed with a detached retina. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lot to learn, and I started off barely benching the bar. Even though it was embarrassing to be at the gym, I still went. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bulked to 160lbs during my first year, and continued cutting/bulking cycles. (This is very ineffective, and looking at my physique today, I realize that.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I got deployed and dropped to my lowest weight ever at 138lbs when it was all said and done. Upon returning home I immediately got back in the gym, and muscle memory hit me like a train. Within a month I was back to 160lbs &amp;amp; I’m currently fluctuating between 175-180lbs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MUSCLE MEMORY IS A DRUG! (I wasn’t even necessarily bulking when I came home, I was eating out constantly and just enjoying myself, but my training was very serious.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall Transformation (More at the bottom.) : &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/5lBqwbA""&gt;Imgur link &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stats:&lt;/strong&gt; 5&amp;#39;9&amp;quot;, Male, SW 140LB, CW 180LB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift Progress:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m aware I’m not very strong, my numbers should be higher for someone who’s trained for 4 years. But I like to focus on bodybuilding vs powerlifting. There is no shame in that! I stopped worrying about numbers a couple years ago, and I am much happier now that I don’t have that weight on my shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bench:&lt;/strong&gt; 65LB &amp;gt; 245LB (no lie, I barely could do the bar. My first max was legitimately 65lbs) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squat:&lt;/strong&gt; 95LB &amp;gt; 315LB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadlift:&lt;/strong&gt; 135LB &amp;gt; 375LB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OHP:&lt;/strong&gt; 45LB &amp;gt; 135LB (Most impressive in my opinion, OHP utilizes much more than just shoulder strength! Good technique can get you stronk) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet:&lt;/strong&gt; I tracked calories using the infamous MyFitnessPal app. I started at 2700 cals, &amp;amp; slowly transitioned into 3200 cals. Eating this many calories has always been difficult for me, I thought I was a “hardgainer” but then I realized I was using that as an excuse as to why I’m not hitting my goals. My most successful way of thinking was forcing myself to eat 1000 cals in the morning, &amp;amp; 800 for lunch. Dinner was easy to get calories in, because I could consume 500 cals before the gym, and whatever remained I could fit in after the gym. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF YOU’RE BULKING: Breakfast is a HUGE indicator on how your day will go. If you can wake up 30 mins earlier than normal, you’ll have more time to cook quality food and put a dent into the days calories. My favorite breakfast was always: 6 scrambled eggs, 2 Kodiak Pancakes, a bowl of strawberries, &amp;amp; 2 packets of oatmeal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch: Usually 8-12oz of chicken breast and 1 cup of rice. With a side of steamed broccoli (thank you instant pot) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner (Pre Gym): 1 pack of ramen (the sodium gives you joocy pumps.) And a banana (cus helth.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post Gym: 2 scoops of protein shake (50g of protein.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner (Post Gym): Pasta noodles &amp;amp; ground beef or steak. (Depends what I have time to cook) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**If I didn’t hit my required calories, I would make my homemade mass gainer shake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MY MASS GAINER RECIPE:
-2 scoops of protein
-1 cup oats
-1 spoon of Peanut Butter 
-1/2 banana (eat the other half, it’s just a yummy snack) 
This amounted to approximately 700-800 cals, depending on your protein. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routine:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve pretty much followed PPL for my whole lifting career. I tried nSuns for a bit, but I didn’t like doing 8sets of power lifts. I was more focused on doing bodybuilding movements. I’ve never done anything out of the ordinary with my training, it’s always been pretty basic and just use what I had at my gym.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PUSH DAY: 
5x5 Bench Press (FLAT) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x12 Bench Press (INCLINE) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x15 Pec Deck (Fly’s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Chest Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Lying Dumbbell Skullcrushers (I noticed I get more activation out of my triceps by using dumbbells versus a EZ bar or barbell.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x12 Rope Push Down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Reverse Pull Down (Use a bar for these and grip the bar underhand, this is my favorite triceps exercise. I’ve never felt activation quite like this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PULL DAY
5x5 Deadlifts &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Barbell Row&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x10 Good Morning (usually after the 3rd set my lower back is like “nah fam” so I rarely went over 3 sets) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Lat Pulldown &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Cable Row &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x12 Bicep Curls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x7 Hammer Curls (HEAVY)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Incline Dumbbell Curls &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x21 21’s (great to finish off with.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Rear Delt Fly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEG DAY (.. and shoulders)
5x5 Barbell Squat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8 Front Squat &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x10 Leg Press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x15 Leg Extension (go light, work the eccentric motion. Try to take pressure off your knees, this exercise is notorious for wrecking knees.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x12 Hamstring Curl (go light, focus on the SQUEEZE, if you do these right you may have Charlie horses that night in bed. ) 🥴&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5x5 Overhead Press &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x15 Side Lateral Raise &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x15 Front Raise (Dumbbell) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIPS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a crock pot / instant pot is a game changer. I could throw a roast or even a steak in the crock pot, let it cook on low while I slept. And when I woke up, I had a fresh meal ready to go! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DON’T WEIGH YOURSELF EVERYDAY (this can be counterproductive when you get tunnel vision on a number. I weigh myself on Mondays / Thursdays.. And always weigh yourself at the same time everyday. First thing in the morning is best, before you eat.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting in calories immediately after the gym is an easy way to hit your calorie numbers. Your body is taxed and can absorb more food right after (jk Idk if that’s even true but that’s what I tell myself🤔) nah but for real, it’s always easier for me to get in calories right after the gym, so I usually double scoop a protein shake. &lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Recently my knees have been getting painfully sore during lifts. Its not sharp knee pain, but the area around my knee feels like its swelling/sore.

Anyone have a good workout to build strength in the knee area for heavier lifting, or advice? Is this just a ""ice them and rest them"" kind of situation or should I be doing stuff to support my knees?

,gainit,"All the stuff swirling around regarding rest days seems totally anecdotal. Lots of vague mentions of benefits that often seem to relate to the mental side of people. Maybe I'm a freak but I absolutely love picking up weight throughout the day. When I feel like I can do another set I go for it. I love the feeling of having a pump at all times.

So what's up with all these rest days? I searched for studies and the few I found seemed to be comparing one group with rest days to another without rest days... with the same total volume!

If you don't take rest days you can creep your volume up on what you would have done wasting all that time. The studies don't take that into account probably because then they are comparing apples to oranges. But it seems to me the non-rest days people are going to just get more volume in over the long haul. They will be grabbing bigger weights at the end of the month. A car not stopping every other day is going to go much father, it seems to me. All the stuff on the web refers to factors like the fact that people will apparently flake out if they have to do something every day. Well, whatever. That doesn't answer the question of whether working out continually would actual lead to greater gains. For those of you who are going to say I am obviously not working out intensely enough... I'm not so sure their 2 or 3 sessions on the same muscle group is really getting them as far as 6 or 7 would. So, can any one point me to any facts about this?

,gainit,"M / 28yrs / 168lbs. / 5' 10"" / 19% bf

Background: About two years ago, I was a very pudgy, unathletic 185lbs. when I decided to start making an effort to better my health. I learned about CICO, began tracking my calories and making sure I wasn't eating more than 1500 calories/day, as well as started training for half-marathons. This became a pretty on-and-off routine for me during the past two years. Eventually, I was able to get down to 158lbs, and felt pretty great, but I was still physically weak, with not much muscle on me whatsoever.

Five weeks ago, I decided to join a gym and shift my focus towards weight lifting and bulking for the first time in my life. My issue is, I feel like I'm gaining too much fat too quickly, and I honestly feel like shit.

When I started my bulk, I began by eating 3,000 kcal/day, which was a 500 kcal surplus from my TDEE, and I made sure I was getting 160g protein/day. As I started to notice I was putting on more than 1 lb./week,  I started reducing my daily calorie intake, and right now I'm consuming 2,500 kcal/day. But, over the past five weeks I have gained 10 lbs, and my belly is getting noticeably larger at a much faster rate than my muscles. Right now, I feel fat, constantly bloated from forcing myself to eat enough food, and because I'm always bloated I consistently feel lethargic and very low energy. I honestly felt physically better when I only ran and focused on eating fewer calories, which I know is counterintuitive. But, I want to get bigger, stronger, and start putting on muscles, and I know I can only do that by eating more calories.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently doing nSuns 4days/week, as well as running \~15 miles/week.

My typical diet right now is 340g cottage cheese + 1 scoop protein powder for breakfast / chicken breast + leftover veggies + cup of rice for lunch / dinner is usually pretty variable, but I try to keep it within my calorie and protein goals for the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm really just looking for reassurance on whether this is a normal experience, and if I need to suck it up and start raising my daily caloric intake and just accept that fat comes with muscle. I know that five weeks is not a very long time at all to start seeing any progress whatsoever, but if I'm making mistakes, I'd like to start course-correcting as soon as possible.

tl;dr title",t2_3zt9l,False,,0,False,"First time bulker worried that he's just getting fat again, and not actually getting fit at all.",[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lwzwqb,False,dark,0.85,,public,9,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,,1614794191.0,,[],{},,True,,1614822671.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;M / 28yrs / 168lbs. / 5&amp;#39; 10&amp;quot; / 19% bf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background: About two years ago, I was a very pudgy, unathletic 185lbs. when I decided to start making an effort to better my health. I learned about CICO, began tracking my calories and making sure I wasn&amp;#39;t eating more than 1500 calories/day, as well as started training for half-marathons. This became a pretty on-and-off routine for me during the past two years. Eventually, I was able to get down to 158lbs, and felt pretty great, but I was still physically weak, with not much muscle on me whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five weeks ago, I decided to join a gym and shift my focus towards weight lifting and bulking for the first time in my life. My issue is, I feel like I&amp;#39;m gaining too much fat too quickly, and I honestly feel like shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started my bulk, I began by eating 3,000 kcal/day, which was a 500 kcal surplus from my TDEE, and I made sure I was getting 160g protein/day. As I started to notice I was putting on more than 1 lb./week,  I started reducing my daily calorie intake, and right now I&amp;#39;m consuming 2,500 kcal/day. But, over the past five weeks I have gained 10 lbs, and my belly is getting noticeably larger at a much faster rate than my muscles. Right now, I feel fat, constantly bloated from forcing myself to eat enough food, and because I&amp;#39;m always bloated I consistently feel lethargic and very low energy. I honestly felt physically better when I only ran and focused on eating fewer calories, which I know is counterintuitive. But, I want to get bigger, stronger, and start putting on muscles, and I know I can only do that by eating more calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently doing nSuns 4days/week, as well as running ~15 miles/week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My typical diet right now is 340g cottage cheese + 1 scoop protein powder for breakfast / chicken breast + leftover veggies + cup of rice for lunch / dinner is usually pretty variable, but I try to keep it within my calorie and protein goals for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Not being able to get enough food down is an actual problem that a lot of powerlifters and bodybuilders often face when they’re trying to push the number on the scale. Force feeding is hard work, and can make for being extremely uncomfortable when you have to eat beyond the point of satiation. I’ve been there. The scale stops moving, calories are already extremely high, and you’re really full after every meal and even before your next meal. It can be really frustrating feeling bloated. After all, they say your gut is like a second brain. So if digestion isn’t on point, it’s not unheard of to be unhappy because of it.

I do not have a problem with appetite anymore. There is a number of strategies I have implemented to help getting the food down. I hope the tips that I have accrued throughout this offseason help you out and allow you to get more food down the hatch.

1. PROTEIN IS VERY SATIATING. I started my last prep at 280g of protein per day. That’s a lot of protein for an 82kg person. No wonder I was struggling to finish my meals (I always did though. Despite having to force it down.) The protein was too excessive for my bodyweight. However, I didn’t get my protein that high on purpose. It happened by default when I was upping my carbs. The small amounts of protein you get from carbs such as rice, potatoes and pastas all add up. When I was increasing the calories, I mistakenly kept my serving size of meat for each meal the same. This ended up me continually adding protein to my diet beyond the point of it being excessive. Even a lot of fat sources contain quite a high amount of protein. Fats like nuts and cheese add protein as well. So the approach I took this year was this. Keep protein at 1g/2.5-3x BW in kg. When upping carbs, drop volume of meat per meal to suit with the added protein I’m getting from that meals carb source. Keep in mind, carbohydrates are protein sparring, so especially in a calorie abundant environment, having a little less protein from animal sources won’t be detrimental to progress. It will be helpful, because you’ll be able to get more carbs down. Unlike protein, carbohydrates are appetite stimulating. Leaving you hungrier and ready for your next meal. Every 60 days, I readjust my Fat and Protein numbers to suit my new bodyweight. This usually only makes for a small increase of 5-8g for each. Like I mentioned in a previous blog, my fats stay right around 1g/1kg BW. So keeping fats low and protein moderate, allows me to eat the least satiating macro more, allowing for continuous calorie progression, and no feeling of bloat or distension.
2. 10 MINUTE WALKS. A common problem that people struggling to consume enough calories due to being too full is not efficiently digesting what they’re eating. The first step is to eat foods that you can digest easily. And then consider going for a brisk 10 minute walk following that meal. Improve digestion, improve appetite, also, improve metabolism.
3. Stan Efferding’s patent pending MONSTER MASH. A way I have found making very large meals less intimidating is by making it into a mash by adding roughly 30 mL of chicken broth to it. It makes the large meal SO much easier to eat. It’s almost like the meal is already chewed up for you, you just need to send it down the hatch. Chicken broth has a lot of health and immunity benefits, but it also makes for meals that sit real easy in the stomach, and somehow, probably magic, don’t fill you up. This make consuming 1,000 calories in a sitting feel like Childs play.
4. IF YOU CANT EAT ALL YOUR CARBS, THEN DRINK ‘EM! I use orange juice. 3 times a day, 500mL each. 50g of carbs, 215 calories, fucking delicious. This makes for 150g of carbs, 645 kcal a day just from liquid. It is as satiating as 500 mL of water. Go figure. Plus, loaded with micronutrients.
5. SMALLER, MORE FREQUENT MEALS. No science or research papers to back this one up. The way I see it is simple. I want to look like a bodybuilder, so, i’ll eat like one. Provide the body with a message, hopefully the body gets the message. Give the body enough cellular signalling to achieve the goals that you are intentionally providing it. If you want to fast all day and look like your hobbies include yoga and Prius conferences, then go for it. I find it difficult getting 5,000 calories in, in a 4 hour window. So my solution is simple. Do it the way the bodybuilders have done it from the start. Eat from the moment I get up, to before I go to bed.

This list is simple. Really simple. But it’s these little details that often get overlooked when assessing ones diet. Constant overfeeding, in my opinion, leads to blown-out midsections and enlarged waists. I feel like I fell prey to this after only a year of force feeding. I started the mass phase very lean, got to power-shovelling the food, ate beyond satiation, dieted back down, and my waist was noticeably larger then before. If you’re digesting your food properly, hunger levels follow as a result. If you’re NOT hungry for your next meal, instead of forcing the next one day, firstly, address why it is that you’re not hungry. If you were breaking down food efficiently, you’d be ready to eat every single time that next meal was knocking on your bodybuilding goals door. 

As a side note, Pro Tan emphasises that SHIT out of stretch marks. Blow out your waist? Better get comfortable with the stretch marks on the glutes, hips, lower back and lower abs to stick out like dogs balls.

There’s no such thing as a hard gainer. Every single person that i’ve conversed with who self-diagnosis’ themselves as struggling to put on weight, is simply put, not even close to trying hard enough. Force feeding is really uncomfortable, but it’s not the only means of getting those needed calories down. Learn to choose foods that you can eat in large quantities, pick foods that are extremely dense in calories, and address digestion issues. If the scale isn’t moving upwards, it’s not because you’re a hard gainer, it’s because it doesn’t mean enough to you. To actually illicit some change in bodyweight, you may have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It took me a while of struggling to continue the linear progression of weight gain to start implementing the five tips I outlined above, but when I did, eating became a lot more enjoyable, and easier. Like they say, “Compliance is the science.” So get to eating, but eating smart, and in a manner that stimulates hunger, and not alleviate it.",t2_8m9ciuwj,False,,0,False,IMPROVING APPETITE,[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_lweqe9,False,dark,0.98,,public,251,6,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,251,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614754149.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought this might be an interesting read for the kids on here trying to break through weight plateaus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not have a problem with appetite anymore. There is a number of strategies I have implemented to help getting the food down. I hope the tips that I have accrued throughout this offseason help you out and allow you to get more food down the hatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PROTEIN IS VERY SATIATING. I started my last prep at 280g of protein per day. That’s a lot of protein for an 82kg person. No wonder I was struggling to finish my meals (I always did though. Despite having to force it down.) The protein was too excessive for my bodyweight. However, I didn’t get my protein that high on purpose. It happened by default when I was upping my carbs. The small amounts of protein you get from carbs such as rice, potatoes and pastas all add up. When I was increasing the calories, I mistakenly kept my serving size of meat for each meal the same. This ended up me continually adding protein to my diet beyond the point of it being excessive. Even a lot of fat sources contain quite a high amount of protein. Fats like nuts and cheese add protein as well. So the approach I took this year was this. Keep protein at 1g/2.5-3x BW in kg. When upping carbs, drop volume of meat per meal to suit with the added protein I’m getting from that meals carb source. Keep in mind, carbohydrates are protein sparring, so especially in a calorie abundant environment, having a little less protein from animal sources won’t be detrimental to progress. It will be helpful, because you’ll be able to get more carbs down. Unlike protein, carbohydrates are appetite stimulating. Leaving you hungrier and ready for your next meal. Every 60 days, I readjust my Fat and Protein numbers to suit my new bodyweight. This usually only makes for a small increase of 5-8g for each. Like I mentioned in a previous blog, my fats stay right around 1g/1kg BW. So keeping fats low and protein moderate, allows me to eat the least satiating macro more, allowing for continuous calorie progression, and no feeling of bloat or distension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 MINUTE WALKS. A common problem that people struggling to consume enough calories due to being too full is not efficiently digesting what they’re eating. The first step is to eat foods that you can digest easily. And then consider going for a brisk 10 minute walk following that meal. Improve digestion, improve appetite, also, improve metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stan Efferding’s patent pending MONSTER MASH. A way I have found making very large meals less intimidating is by making it into a mash by adding roughly 30 mL of chicken broth to it. It makes the large meal SO much easier to eat. It’s almost like the meal is already chewed up for you, you just need to send it down the hatch. Chicken broth has a lot of health and immunity benefits, but it also makes for meals that sit real easy in the stomach, and somehow, probably magic, don’t fill you up. This make consuming 1,000 calories in a sitting feel like Childs play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IF YOU CANT EAT ALL YOUR CARBS, THEN DRINK ‘EM! I use orange juice. 3 times a day, 500mL each. 50g of carbs, 215 calories, fucking delicious. This makes for 150g of carbs, 645 kcal a day just from liquid. It is as satiating as 500 mL of water. Go figure. Plus, loaded with micronutrients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SMALLER, MORE FREQUENT MEALS. No science or research papers to back this one up. The way I see it is simple. I want to look like a bodybuilder, so, i’ll eat like one. Provide the body with a message, hopefully the body gets the message. Give the body enough cellular signalling to achieve the goals that you are intentionally providing it. If you want to fast all day and look like your hobbies include yoga and Prius conferences, then go for it. I find it difficult getting 5,000 calories in, in a 4 hour window. So my solution is simple. Do it the way the bodybuilders have done it from the start. Eat from the moment I get up, to before I go to bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is simple. Really simple. But it’s these little details that often get overlooked when assessing ones diet. Constant overfeeding, in my opinion, leads to blown-out midsections and enlarged waists. I feel like I fell prey to this after only a year of force feeding. I started the mass phase very lean, got to power-shovelling the food, ate beyond satiation, dieted back down, and my waist was noticeably larger then before. If you’re digesting your food properly, hunger levels follow as a result. If you’re NOT hungry for your next meal, instead of forcing the next one day, firstly, address why it is that you’re not hungry. If you were breaking down food efficiently, you’d be ready to eat every single time that next meal was knocking on your bodybuilding goals door. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, Pro Tan emphasises that SHIT out of stretch marks. Blow out your waist? Better get comfortable with the stretch marks on the glutes, hips, lower back and lower abs to stick out like dogs balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no such thing as a hard gainer. Every single person that i’ve conversed with who self-diagnosis’ themselves as struggling to put on weight, is simply put, not even close to trying hard enough. Force feeding is really uncomfortable, but it’s not the only means of getting those needed calories down. Learn to choose foods that you can eat in large quantities, pick foods that are extremely dense in calories, and address digestion issues. If the scale isn’t moving upwards, it’s not because you’re a hard gainer, it’s because it doesn’t mean enough to you. To actually illicit some change in bodyweight, you may have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It took me a while of struggling to continue the linear progression of weight gain to start implementing the five tips I outlined above, but when I did, eating became a lot more enjoyable, and easier. Like they say, “Compliance is the science.” So get to eating, but eating smart, and in a manner that stimulates hunger, and not alleviate it.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hey all,

Just wanted to drop in and say I just finished my first ever bulk. 

Started this bulk cycle at 190lb on July 1st after having lost 150lb from my peak weight of 340lb back in June of 2019.

Losing that much weight left a lot of loose skin, but I'm working on slowly filling it out with muscle.  https://imgur.com/gallery/WtJMxxE

During this time, I ate at a 500kcal surplus to put on a pound per week. Originally, I had planned on stopping my bulk Jan 1st, but was convinced by u/mythicalstrength to keep going, as there is ""never a wrong time to bulk"". So, I kept it going for an extra two months.

From Mid Jan to Mid Feb, I focused primarily on strength and powerlifting, as my gym has a 1000lb club (combined total lifts between deadlift, squat, and bench all are 1000+lb).

I figured as a home-stretch goal, I wanted to hit those numbers. At the time, however, I was about 25lb short, so I found a peaking program solely based around 4 weeks of growing your 1RM. I increase my calories, started this program, and lifted away.

I am happy to say that at the end of those 4 weeks, I managed to get my goal of hitting 1000lb. https://imgur.com/gallery/SmfFfrN

Ultimately, I'm super happy with my progress. 40lb is a lot of weight to gain, a bunch of fat, but a bunch of is also muscle, so for my first bulk, I'm super happy. Looking forward to cutting for a while to strip away excess body fat. 

Thanks for all your continued support and encouragement!  💕💕💕

EDIT: 

The mod would like food and meal info. So, here goes:

For calories, I ate a total of 3,250/day. Sometimes slightly more. Overall, just making sure I was getting enough calories. I stopped really caring about the scale, as I started weighing myself month instead of weekly, as I really just cared about eating to fuel recovery and growth.

Generally, I get about 220gr of protein a day. That's mainly greek yogurt, lunch meat, some type of lean meat like pork loin, protein scoop in my oatmeal in the morning, protein shake after lifting, and that's mainly it for consistent protein sources. 

The rest of the calories could be whatever. But usually I ate the same thing every day:

Breakfast - 1 cup oatmeal in water with a scoop of protein powder. If I was working out that day, I'd eat about an extra 100kcal of fruit.

Lunch - Two wraps on low carb bread, with 200~ calories of meat, some cheese, some mayo, veggies. If I was working out that day, I'd slam about 6 large marshmallows about 30 minutes before lifting.

Dinner - Either huge bowl of stir fried veggies on rice or with meat. Hebrew National Hot dogs... giant chunk of pork loin... whatever.

Snackies - This is where I ate most of my calories, and almost always at night. Usually ends up being about 1200-1500 calories of snacks into the late evening starting around 8p. This might be a big ass bowl of popcorn, some greek yogurt, left overs, bagels, cheese, fudgsicles, whatever. My nights are usually watching something with the wife or playing nerd games, so I'm usually snacking.

,gainit,"Alright, so I am doing sports for almost a year now (I guess around 10-11 months). I am a guy, 23 years old, I'm about 1,90m tall and weigh approximately 78kg. When I started working out, I was somewhere around 70kg (no doubt the biggest part of my weight gain is because of my diet not being perfect, though I'm not a junkfood junky at all).

In the time I have been working out, I have seen changes, but in my opinion, they aren't going fast enough. I'm doing what I think is right, but sometimes I do think to myself: ""Is this the right way? Should I be doing something else? Or maybe do something different with my weights/diet?"". Therefore, I am now asking it here, to give myself the general idea of things I'm doing wrong and things I'm doing good. Also, I have been working out at home all the time, so the only equipment I have are dumbbells and a bench which basically can't incline/decline.

To give an idea of my workout, I exercise every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. All other days I basically don't workout, at best I take a walk for about 30 minutes. Here is my schedule:

**Tuesday: Triceps/Chest/Legs - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 12kg each.**

* Bench press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Dips - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squeeze press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squats - 3 sets of 10
* Tricep Kickback - 3 sets of 8 on each arm
* Bicep Curl - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* One Arm Tricep Extension - 3 sets of 8 on each arm
* Calf Raise - 3 sets of 15

**Thursday: Legs/Biceps/Triceps - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 12kg each.**

* Push-ups - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Bench press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squeeze press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Lunges - 2 sets of 12 on each leg
* Bicep Curls - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Hammer Curls - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Squats - 3 sets of 10
* One Arm Tricep Extension - 3 sets of 8 on each arm

**Saturday: Shoulders/Back - All workouts are done with 2 dumbbells of 10kg each (my shoulders and back are a bit weaker than the rest).**

* Overhead Press - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Bent-Over - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Wide-grip Upright Row - 2 sets of 10, then 2 sets of 8
* Arnold Press - 2 sets of 10, then 1 set of 8
* Bench Bent-Over - 2 sets of 12 on each arm
* Front Raise - 2 sets of 10, then 1 set of 8 and 1 set of 6 (This one is a bit hard for me to complete all 4 sets properly)
* Shrugs - 3 sets of 15

I basically do all exercises with 30 seconds rest between sets and 90 seconds rest between exercises. Now, finally, the thing I am wondering: Is this the good way to go? For sure my diet can be changed, in fact it probably needs to be changed, but is that the sole reason that I find my ""gains"" to be too slow? Or am I taking these exercises on in a very wrong way, making it harder for myself?

I've been gaining on and off for roughly two years. Making progress and losing it due to work/stress. Now that work has finally died down I want to go full forward and gain 30-40lbs. Now my question is, is varying my calorie intake depending on what I did that day okay?

Now my 4000kcal intake is due to the nature of my work - im walking 20km a day usually, and my intake has to reflect that. On the weekends I'd much rather stomach 2800kcal and still be in a surplus, since I do very little walking, and hopefully still be gaining.

,gainit,"(Current stats and bodywhat link at end)

Title says it all- I’ve been lifting for a long time but I’ve spent a most of that time doing three things- 
1. Crash dieting to the 130-140 lb range, once to 127 lbs, sometimes maintaining this for 4 months 
2. Subsequently getting injured (stress fractures, sprained ankles and wrists, pulled muscles) and losing drive for periods of 3-4 months  
3. Allowing myself to bulk, but soon ending up as fat as before and with barely any additional 
muscle, like 20%.

Year 1, went from pretty lean , leaner than my oldest bodywhat pic, at about age 18 and 130 lbs, up to 145 lbs with higher bodyfat. I did my first cut 10-11 months into my first year, from 152 to 135. Overall my lifts went up year 1 from 90/160/115/160 ohp/sq/bench/dl up to about 120/270/190/365. Deadlift was with poor form and mixed grip.

YEAR 2-
 I hit ohp/sq/b/dl 130/290/200/420. Years 3-6 I fucked up repeatedly like above.. 2020 was the year I started to gain some common sense, being age 24. 


CURRENT STATS- 

Now, at 25, I’m stuck. My lifts are at a respectable level - s/bench/dl/ohp- estimated around 340/210/440/145. Haven’t tested bench this year though.
However , my body stats are 5’7.75” 165 lbs 21%-22% bodyfat (estimated with laser X-ray vision). 

More importantly, my damn arms and calves are tiny. I have about 13.5-14” flexed arms, 10.5” forearms, 13.25” calves, on a 7.3” ankle and 6” wrist frame. 

I train hard and end up feeling like an emptied toothpaste tube at the end of my workouts, and have an extremely good diet and sleep. I have normal to high testosterone, with all my tests ever ranging from 640-900, usually at 750 ng/dl.
I don’t know why I’m having so much trouble building muscle! It’s like I can only gain muscle on my ass, thighs, and shoulders, but even then, mostly fat.

&lt;p&gt;Title says it all- I’ve been lifting for a long time but I’ve spent a most of that time doing three things- 
1. Crash dieting to the 130-140 lb range, once to 127 lbs, sometimes maintaining this for 4 months 
2. Subsequently getting injured (stress fractures, sprained ankles and wrists, pulled muscles) and losing drive for periods of 3-4 months&lt;br/&gt;
3. Allowing myself to bulk, but soon ending up as fat as before and with barely any additional 
muscle, like 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-X4rhy_Eh8FV6XeMWTJcAwK-1Rxy7AZm2SzQm6doiJs/edit

In December, After talking with a couple people and self-reflecting I realized it wasn’t working, and started using Arnold’s basic beginner program #1 using higher weight around 40-60 depending on the exercise, and 15 pounds for dumbbells

Current day, I have to be honest with saying I’ve seen no real progression, and it pisses me off that I have wasted so much time, and I blame no one but myself for not taking time to do proper research. I’ve chalked it up to a few things:

Diet: I never was keeping track of what I was eating, and I really can’t be eating so much since Im apart of a relatively big family and can’t be eating, say 3-5 eggs for breakfast a day. I also am pretty limited to whatever my parents make for dinner. As for breakfast and lunch, I have been eating things such as oatmeal, cottage cheese, eggs, etc + breakfast at school as it’s now free where I live.

Weight, reps, sets: I mentioned the weight I’ve been using earlier, and as for reps I’ve been trying 6-8 for 4 sets, but I’m unsure if any of this is right as I find my arms giving out way to early into the sets for an exercise.

Days spent lifting: I’ve always lifted weights Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but I’m considering lifting weights 5 days out of the week instead of just three.

I'll start off with a bit of information:
I am a 16 year old male who is trying to gain weight and tone up. I am currently 6'4"" and weigh around 143 pounds (I know, I'm underweight). 

I work out 6 days a week on average and my routine consists of:

• Pushups (around 50 throughout the day)

• Crunches (2 sets of 25)

• Leg raises ( 2 sets of 30)

• One minute plank

• V sit ups (3 sets of 10)

• Bicep curls (3 sets of 8)

• Squats (3 sets of 10)

Now for the main point of this post. I obviously need to gain weight and my goal is to get to around 160 pounds or so. Should I just be eating as much as possible without taking the quality and health benefits of the food into consideration, or should I be eating nutritious meals?

,gainit,"Hi all, I humbly request advice.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a 20 year old college student. I've been ""seriously"" training since summer of 2019, so about 1.5 years now. I got my numbers up (starting from the bar) for about a semester before that first summer, but didn't really have any idea about nutrition or programming. I didn't have much sports background before, and was very skinny (5'8 138 lb), so I essentially started from nothing. I made OK progress initially (both visually and strength). I lost record of my numbers, but by September 2020, my SBD was likely around 300/190/(spent a long time practicing form for deadlifts), at 168 lb. Up till this point, I was using the nSuns 5 day routine, but had seen diminishing returns and it was getting boring, so I switched to the CoolCicada PPL routine, but kept the nSuns squat layout for the leg days. 

&amp;nbsp;

By November, I had gotten my squat to a max of 345 once (highest working set was 315x4 a week before that max attempt), and bench didn't really increase much--I did 205 with poor, grindy form once, but from September to November, general working sets for the heavier bench day only went from 155 5x5 to 165 5x5. Continued practicing deadlifts and got closer to 300 with solid form.

&amp;nbsp;

I was slightly depressed/lethargic at home for break, and did a couple of weeks of traveling with just body weight exercises, so I pretty much just maintained until January, still doing the PPL routine. Since I had been bulking for the entirety of my lifting journey and was getting a bit fluffier at 177lb, I decided to cut, and since I was not really seeing much progress with a linear program, I also concurrently began Candito's 6 week ""intermediate"" program mixed with his bench program since I needed more practice with bench. Starting that program, I entered my 1RMs at 320/200/300, since I was still feeling slightly rusty from winter break. Currently in the middle of week 5 of the program (and of my cut), and I've lost 8-9 pounds back to 168, and my strength is pretty much the same as 5 weeks before, which is fine. I have to admit, I rarely tracked calories when I bulked--I ate similar whole foods daily, and was gaining weight at a relatively slow pace. Since starting my cut, I've been eating around 2k-2.1k calories daily, about 180g P, 200g C, and 50g F, and walking to and from campus a total of 3 miles 5 days a week.

&amp;nbsp;

During the previous few weeks and last semester, I would never miss a training session, try my best during those sessions, am cognizant about improving form, would eat in a surplus with enough protein, sleep an average of 7 hours, and have done a lot of research on nutrition and training. Yet, I'm not satisfied with my progress both visually and strength-wise. Week to week, I'm not so discouraged by my strength not increasing, since I understand it takes time, but looking back at the last 6+ months, it is a bit disheartening to see minimal progress even as I (think I) put in the work. I compared a progress pictures in the same lighting, pose, and no-pump from today and October, and I can see essentially no difference. I understand progress typically slows as one trains for longer, but seeing as how I'm still so early on my journey, I expected more significant change. Obviously, I'm not giving up and will continue to train with intent.

&amp;nbsp;

Any advice or recommended resources? I'd love to hear some perspectives on how to move forward, and welcome any and all critiques as long as it's constructive. My current goals are to build a more substantive muscular base and improve strength.

I generally try to aim for 5-6 exercises per muscle group of 4 sets each and realized this may be excessive and hindering my muscle growth. I'm about 6'3 and 200 pounds but still feel pretty skinny. I've upped weights in my bench, squat, etc. over the past few months but I feel like I may be overdoing it. Recently, I realized I should be doing front delts with my push day and Rear delts with my pull day.

I always feel like I'm doing something wrong when I tell someone my workouts usually last this long and they look at me weird. I don't take obnoxiously long rest times (45 seconds-1.5 mins depending on heavy/accessory work). 

My fear is this is what my body has become accustomed to so taking it back a scale wouldn't help much.

&lt;p&gt;1) Tricep Pushdown with Rope (4 x 7-8)/Superset with Tricep Overhead Extension with Rope (4 x 7-8);        2) Tricep Dips with bench (I put my feet on another bench with plates and do 3 dropsets) (4 x 7-8);&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always feel like I&amp;#39;m doing something wrong when I tell someone my workouts usually last this long and they look at me weird. I don&amp;#39;t take obnoxiously long rest times (45 seconds-1.5 mins depending on heavy/accessory work). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fear is this is what my body has become accustomed to so taking it back a scale wouldn&amp;#39;t help much. The recommended programs I see online/here seem to only hit chest with 3 exercises on a pull day which seems light to me, especially as a weak point of mine but open to suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Been bulking for a measly two months. Using a custom (but sensible) upper/lower/rest three day cycle. Working so far as I've gained FAT, yes, but also muscle, which despite the short time period is noticeable on the leaner areas (biceps, quads etc.). Eating a 500 calorie daily surplus and intend to keep the bulk up for a total six months.

&amp;#x200B;

Two minor problems:

&amp;#x200B;

1. A little more fat gain than I'd like (need to get fat on a bulk, but to be fair I think I was a bit fat when I started, just carried it well on a tallish frame)
2. Some niggly pains at various joints/tendons/ligaments; not major, but nonetheless a sign of stress

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of resting for half a week, resuming, then seeing how I feel. If niggles persist, I will take off another half week. If still persisting, a full week. Still working on form and conditioning the body so hope that these minor pains will eventually fade. Have at times been guilty of lifting too heavy too quickly (not sensible).

During this lower intensity period I will reduce to a caloric deficit as though I was cutting, although keeping reasonably high protein for muscle maintenance.

Essentially I am initiating a (very) miniature cut/repair phase, then resuming the bulk. Depending on fat gain/joint pains, may repeat this every month (half a week) or every two months (full week).

Is this sensible? I'm a beginner, although instinct tells me this could be worth it in the long-term. Obviously concerned about losing muscle gains, and whilst I'm not really believing that this is a danger with such a minor change, would be nice to hear others' opinions.

,gainit,"Hey,

So I’ve got my breakfast routine sorted. Posted previously about breakfast prep, and since discovered burritos. 100g beef, 2 x eggs &amp;amp; peppers, 1 x hash brown, cheese, hot sauce, tortilla. Bulk prep. In the freezer. Done for the week. Awesome. Circa. 550 calories, 45g protein each. Mixed with my breakfast shake, it’s circa. 1,100 calories and 85g protein before I’ve even got to midday.

However, mind is now going to how to improve lunches and prep for them (as work full time). They’re ok at the moment, but could be better and less time consuming. Don’t want a huge lunch as would prefer to have bigger dinner after all the calories at breakfast. To fit in with my goals, lunch only needs to be around 400/500 calories and 30g protein.

One of the big things that puts me off prepping a week of lunches is I really despise the taste of reheated microwave chicken.

Are there any recipes that you can suggest that avoid this? Or any general tips? Maybe my pre-prepared chicken needs to be in a sauce / broth kind of situation to avoid / mask that awful dry / chemical taste when reheating chicken? Or maybe I should just stick with another meat? But just don’t want to be eating beef 3 x times a day as that will get old. Turkey I’m not a fan of at all. I do like ham though but not sure it’s the best meat for bulking?

The thing is that I want to lose this extra fat so I know that I should just go on a fat loss.

It may be obvious but I have a fast metabolism which means that it was always hard for me to bulk.

Starting Maxes (Estimated):

Current Maxes (Estimated):

Deadlift: 255lbs/116kg

What I Ate because this is r/gainit:

 I did shakes at the beginning but never twice a day and they never amounted over 1k calories probably because laziness. After about 2-3 months I transitioned fully into drinking half a gallon of fairlife milk a day, since then it’s basically been impossible for me to miss protein any day. If anything I tend to go way overboard and have been working on cutting back protein intake. I also made sure to get 4-8 servings of vegetables everyday (mostly spinach) because they made me feel good. Boring chicken and rice a lot but I’ve never really cared about what I ate before so it didn’t matter much to me as long as I hit my macros. I ate 3-6 eggs everyday because I read somewhere they’re filled with micros and immediately trusted that source. I work a physical job so easy access foods were important for those 8 hours, this is when I drank the milk and ate about 900 calories worth of almonds, cashews, and dark chocolate. I incorporated variety at some points but milk, nuts, dark chocolate, eggs, chicken, rice, and spinach were the most frequently consumed foods. I also tracked my calories pretty religiously for 4/5 months but in the past month I’ve gotten lazy and am still gaining around the right amount so that’s nice. 

What I do at the gym:

Slight case of fuckarounditis but I do go to the gym 5 days a week doing a PPLUL split and I train very very hard. Also did 0 direct ab training in this time.

Thoughts about gaining so far:

I can’t stress how much I prefer not having to hear how skinny I am everyday, that was pretty annoying. Other guys seem to respond better to me now, the girl response is mostly the same as before. Around maybe 10ish people in my day to day life have noticed, and like 3/4 ar the gym I go to regularly. I think I’m going to go to 160 and then cut for the summer, but that depends on my satisfaction with my lifts. For some reason I don’t care that much about the bulk belly I have or the fat I gained despite family members pointing it out all the time. Overall I would rate gaining 25 pounds as a positive experience.

,gainit,"Hi everyone, yesterday marked exactly 3 months of my fitness and gaining routine, so I thought I’d share my progress so far. 

https://imgur.com/a/7J0Ne0x (last 3 pics are within 2 days of each other, just different lighting) 

I don’t track my calories to the exact amount, but always make sure I’m getting above 3k per day, and usually around 180-200 grams of protein. My diet is nothing different than the hundreds of posts you see on this subreddit, so not gonna touch on that, but I will say that mass gainer shakes helped out immensely the first month or so when adjusting to a bigger diet. 

Lifts
——-

Unfortunately I have only had access to a smith machine so can’t really compare these numbers to a true barbell lift, but: 

Bench: 145 1rm - 215 1rm

Squat: 185 1rm - 265 1rm 

I’ve noticed consistent growth in all of the accessory lifts I’ve done as well so happy about that. 

Routine
————-
4 day split:

-Chest and Tris 

-Back and Bis

-Legs

-Shoulders, Bis and Tris

-Rest


Goals
———

Short term (Daily/Weekly)

-Weigh myself every morning to get a consistent weekly average of weight 

-Hit 3200+calories per day or more depending on weight measurements

-Gain between .5lb-1lb per week


Medium Term: (3-12 months)

-Hit a true 225 bench press

-Hit a true 315 squat 

-Hit 190 weight 

-Join a new gym with free barbells so I can incorporate deadlift and OHP into my routine 


Long term: (1 year +)

-200 lb weight

-successfully go through a gaining/cutting cycle 
-1000 lb club 


Conclusion
——————
Overall I’ve learned a lot the last 3 months thanks to this subreddit and my brother who is an advanced lifter. I’m happy with the gains I’ve made in all of my lifts and looking forward to hitting new goals that I set for myself.

I lost 30 lbs following IF 16:8 and doing some kind of physical activity daily (i.e., Greyskull LP with accessories &amp; cardio).  2 months ago I hit my ""goal weight"" and was starting to follow the LeanGains methodology to pack on some muscle.  Unfortunately, in those 2 months I haven't seen much progress; my lifting numbers and PRs have gone up, but not a lot of physical changes.  I have been eating at a very slight surplus with 1 gram of protein per body weight (i.e., 140 grams).

I'm going to start a ""classic"" bulk of 500 surplus calories daily.  Going from eating less to lose weight to eating a lot more to gain muscle has been a challenge, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.

I'm following 5/3/1 for Beginners now with a fair amount of accessories.

But getting back on subject. This is my first cut and I recently decided to cut down to 175lbs from 200lbs. Im dropping my calories from 2,300 to 1,660 and making sure I get around 130g of protein daily to help minimize strength loss.

I work out 5-6 days a week so that means I'm Benching and squatting 3-4x a week. I love the progress I have been making and the idea that I might be losing strength/ Not being able to handle the volume bothers me a little but is something I can accept.

Im sure I will be able to continue making gains on my squats and deads considering they are so low. But I'm curious about more ways to increase my bench during my cut if the volume starts to become too taxing. I want to reach a 330 Bench by july.

P.s My Deads and Squats are low because I injured my lower back due to bad form from both. I decided to drop my weight very low to focus on my form and build from there.

,gainit,"Hey guys! I \[21/M/5'9""/115 lbs\] have  been struggling for about 6 or so years now to gain weight since my  growth spurt stopped. While I have tried calorie packing countless  times, I have never really had success. However, I have recently found  myself being able to eat and drink many more calories recently. While I  don't want to dwell too much, I think that this may be due to having  online college classes and having more time than ever to cook full meals  that I enjoy. Usually, I have felt too rushed to eat much for breakfast  at all, but nowadays, I have a routine of eating a sizeable breakfast  every day (a few eggs, toast, butter, and sometimes yogurt), and I have  also started drinking 2-4 cups of whole fat chocolate milk per day  (which I hope to increase over the next coming weeks).

My  experience tells me however that I will soon probably lose the ability  to stuff myself everyday no matter how hard I try since I start to enjoy  even the thought of food less and less with how much I am eating.

Hi,

24M 5’7 135 lbs

Wanted to ask for some opinions:

I used to work out at least twice a week for my entire life (have been lifting recreationally since I’m 15) and was stable at around 145 lbs that way. Now after last March everything changed and I stopped working out almost completely.

I started having some GI problems around March too that I still have to this date. Now my question is: how realistic is it to lose 10 lbs of muscle/glycogen/water over this period?

I look at myself in the mirror today and can barely recognize myself. My legs look very skinny and my arms too. I wasn’t swole by any means, but I was definitely in decent shape (no visible abs, but solid back and arms for example).

I’ve been worried that all this weight I’ve lost has been from my GI issues, but I just realized some of it could be muscle too.

Did anyone else lose such a large amount of mass just from not working out during 2020?

Hey guys it’s me again lmao if any of you remember me from over six months ago! 

Conversions for metric people: 56-72.3kg

As usual, you guys come for the pics so here they are first

For my routine, I just roughly follow the r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine and added some dumbbell exercises with adjustable weights for progressive overload. Feel free to DM or comment to ask more haha. Also, I dance three times a week for around 2-3 hours each time. 

Honestly for me I just workout every other day before I sleep, and with school and everything I can’t be bothered to follow a full on routine with what some of you guys have here. For me I just want to establish the habit of working out and enjoying it so in the future I can take up different routines more easily and progress from there. I’m still 16 and I don’t want to put so much thought into this just yet so this is me not really taking this whole thing overly seriously. 

In the last post, (it’s in my profile still you guys can go check haha) some of you guys commented on the carb/sugar stuff so I really tried to watch that. I lost some weight after that to cut down on the fat and now I’m trying to gain weight again but I’m being more careful this time. What really helps for me recently was weighing everyday to see if I was gaining a sensible amount. 

For 2021, I really made it a point to not skip workouts or at least get something in on my workout days, since consistency is so important and it’s something I lacked last year which slowed my progress. 

Right now I’m still trying to gain weight but I’m really watching the fat and I’ll cut down once summer nears. 

I hope my post inspires someone to at least start or helps anyone low on motivation

,gainit,"Hey guys, been progressing well on lifts, including bench, and I'm always very conscious of my form on bench to prevent RC injuries, yet sometimes post sets I still feel a little inflammation/warmth coming from the RC.

My standard routine for bench is to warm up with shoulder swings, across the chest stretches, and then probably 10 reps of bench at 45, 5 reps at 95, 5 reps at 135, then whatever my rep/set-weight is.

Hi guys, back with another annual progress thread!

This is a follow-up from this post I made two years ago where you can read more about me and my story: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress\_m2159\_110lbs\_50kg\_152lbs\_69kg\_1\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress_m2159_110lbs_50kg_152lbs_69kg_1_year/)

And: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/fbs820/progress\_m2259\_110lbs\_50kg\_156lbs\_707kg\_2\_years/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/fbs820/progress_m2259_110lbs_50kg_156lbs_707kg_2_years/)

**Since the last post, I've gained another 4 lbs this year and have made huge strength and aesthetic gains.**

I still eat the exact same stuff as stated in my post from a year back. However, I sometimes incorporate pork and the odd ""cheat meal"" from time to time, which tend to cause me issues the following days. I won't be doing this anymore from now.

I've since learned that it's important to be grateful for what you CAN eat, even if it's not much. And also the fact that I live a (mostly) pain-free life without meds after my surgeries and daily routine consisting of eating the same foods and taking turmeric, Boswellia, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, propolis, Salmon fish oil, creatine, L-glutamine, working out (and lots of walking outdoors), and a regular sleeping schedule.

Before: [https://imgur.com/a/UOyRXx7](https://imgur.com/a/UOyRXx7) (110lbs / 50kg) 20 years old

Before the before: [https://imgur.com/a/HsV9fAT](https://imgur.com/a/HsV9fAT) (143lbs / 65kg) 19 years old

After: [https://imgur.com/a/gsbUxiV](https://imgur.com/a/gsbUxiV) (152lbs / 69kg) 21 years old

**CURRENT:** [https://imgur.com/a/RtW2Q3s](https://imgur.com/a/RtW2Q3s) **(160lbs / 72.5kg) 23 years old**

&amp;#x200B;

**My workout routine has changed significantly:**

* 10 sets of my max push-ups and shrugs per day (with a tiny 40lbs dumbbell held in both hands, need to upgrade asap). I do this for two days in a row. So about 350-400 push-ups and shrugs with perfect form, really taking my time to do the exercise rather than just chasing numbers.
* 10 sets of my max super wide-grip TOWEL pull-ups and bicep curls. I am going to post a pic later of how I set it up at home. So about 70-80 pull-ups and 50-60 curls with a 40lbs dumbbell. Incredible strength gains in my back, forearms, fingers, and grip overall.

That's it. I do a lot of walking for my legs and also some basic mobility exercises with a resistance band, one-legged calf ""jumping"" raises, and jumping lunges.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some word of advice after many years of doing this:**

* Do stuff that's hard. The numbers don't matter and are subjective. If you can't do more than 5 push-ups in one go, doing 50 per day is going to skyrocket your gains in the next month, then you can move on to more and more to continue offering the same challenge to your body as before
* Perfect form every single time. Humping the ground or looking like you're doing the worm will do little to help you advance along the way. 20 reps with perfect form are way better than 40 half-assed attempts
* For those with digestive issues - calculate your calories needed to bulk up, then experiment until you find your safe foods. Blood tests may be needed regularly at first to make sure you're not increasing your inflammation levels. I'm lucky to be able to eat white bread and not be gluten intolerant, I can't tolerate most fats, but I can eat a shit ton of tahini (sesame paste), so the majority of my calories come from there. The rest are from chicken and rice. I don't calculate macros, but they're probably something like 45% carbs, 35% fats, 20% protein
* If you're easily bored with long, varied routines like me (I know that's a paradox in itself) just find a few exercises that really work well for you and spam the shit out of them
* Researchers constantly come up with contradicting studies. Don't go down the rabbit hole of listening to dudes that spend more time researching the best way to gain muscle and then arguing about it over actually working out. All of those that I know irl think I'm fucking with them when I tell them that I don't go to the gym and only do push-ups and pull-ups

P.S. Can't recommend shaving your head and growing some facial hair enough! I used to be super-feminine looking but now just looking at myself in the mirror finally gives me satisfaction and a ""damn, you kinda look manly"" feeling, which I've read can actually increase your testosterone levels (the looking at yourself in the mirror with a beard part). I'll link up the study later.

&lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up from this post I made two years ago where you can read more about me and my story: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress_m2159_110lbs_50kg_152lbs_69kg_1_year/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/azvdul/progress_m2159_110lbs_50kg_152lbs_69kg_1_year/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/fbs820/progress_m2259_110lbs_50kg_156lbs_707kg_2_years/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/fbs820/progress_m2259_110lbs_50kg_156lbs_707kg_2_years/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since the last post, I&amp;#39;ve gained another 4 lbs this year and have made huge strength and aesthetic gains.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still eat the exact same stuff as stated in my post from a year back. However, I sometimes incorporate pork and the odd &amp;quot;cheat meal&amp;quot; from time to time, which tend to cause me issues the following days. I won&amp;#39;t be doing this anymore from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve since learned that it&amp;#39;s important to be grateful for what you CAN eat, even if it&amp;#39;s not much. And also the fact that I live a (mostly) pain-free life without meds after my surgeries and daily routine consisting of eating the same foods and taking turmeric, Boswellia, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, propolis, Salmon fish oil, creatine, L-glutamine, working out (and lots of walking outdoors), and a regular sleeping schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/UOyRXx7""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/UOyRXx7&lt;/a&gt; (110lbs / 50kg) 20 years old&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the before: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/HsV9fAT""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/HsV9fAT&lt;/a&gt; (143lbs / 65kg) 19 years old&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After: &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/gsbUxiV""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/gsbUxiV&lt;/a&gt; (152lbs / 69kg) 21 years old&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CURRENT:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/RtW2Q3s""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/RtW2Q3s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(160lbs / 72.5kg) 23 years old&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My workout routine has changed significantly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 sets of my max push-ups and shrugs per day (with a tiny 40lbs dumbbell held in both hands, need to upgrade asap). I do this for two days in a row. So about 350-400 push-ups and shrugs with perfect form, really taking my time to do the exercise rather than just chasing numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 sets of my max super wide-grip TOWEL pull-ups and bicep curls. I am going to post a pic later of how I set it up at home. So about 70-80 pull-ups and 50-60 curls with a 40lbs dumbbell. Incredible strength gains in my back, forearms, fingers, and grip overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. I do a lot of walking for my legs and also some basic mobility exercises with a resistance band, one-legged calf &amp;quot;jumping&amp;quot; raises, and jumping lunges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some word of advice after many years of doing this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do stuff that&amp;#39;s hard. The numbers don&amp;#39;t matter and are subjective. If you can&amp;#39;t do more than 5 push-ups in one go, doing 50 per day is going to skyrocket your gains in the next month, then you can move on to more and more to continue offering the same challenge to your body as before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect form every single time. Humping the ground or looking like you&amp;#39;re doing the worm will do little to help you advance along the way. 20 reps with perfect form are way better than 40 half-assed attempts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those with digestive issues - calculate your calories needed to bulk up, then experiment until you find your safe foods. Blood tests may be needed regularly at first to make sure you&amp;#39;re not increasing your inflammation levels. I&amp;#39;m lucky to be able to eat white bread and not be gluten intolerant, I can&amp;#39;t tolerate most fats, but I can eat a shit ton of tahini (sesame paste), so the majority of my calories come from there. The rest are from chicken and rice. I don&amp;#39;t calculate macros, but they&amp;#39;re probably something like 45% carbs, 35% fats, 20% protein&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#39;re easily bored with long, varied routines like me (I know that&amp;#39;s a paradox in itself) just find a few exercises that really work well for you and spam the shit out of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers constantly come up with contradicting studies. Don&amp;#39;t go down the rabbit hole of listening to dudes that spend more time researching the best way to gain muscle and then arguing about it over actually working out. All of those that I know irl think I&amp;#39;m fucking with them when I tell them that I don&amp;#39;t go to the gym and only do push-ups and pull-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Can&amp;#39;t recommend shaving your head and growing some facial hair enough! I used to be super-feminine looking but now just looking at myself in the mirror finally gives me satisfaction and a &amp;quot;damn, you kinda look manly&amp;quot; feeling, which I&amp;#39;ve read can actually increase your testosterone levels (the looking at yourself in the mirror with a beard part). I&amp;#39;ll link up the study later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask me anything you want!&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Bit of background….

I spent the whole of 2020 losing weight. Dropped 40lbs to 147lb (Male, 5’11”) 

Got super lean through calorie deficit and cardio, around 10% body fat which was always my goal before I started lifting (yes I know I should have started lifting sooner!)

So now I’ve been lifting 5x per week since 1st December and since 1st Jan have been on a reverse diet. 

Finished my cut on 2000 cals/day and since then I have done:

2 weeks at 2200 (still lost weight)
2 weeks at 2400 (still lost weight) 

Now coming to the end of 2 weeks at 2700 and looks like I will gain around 1lb after the 2 weeks. 

But is this long enough to confirm I’m in a surplus? My brain is telling me no, if I lost weight at 2400 over 2 weeks then I’m not going to be gaining weight at 2700. 

Where I’m still a new lifter I think there’s an element of newbie muscle gain contributing to the ‘gain’ as well as the fact that my diet is a lot more carb heavy than it was when cutting. 

Would you do another 2 weeks at 2700 and then observe the results over 4 weeks? 

I’m REALLY wanting to dial in on my maintenance calories before I dive into ‘bulk mode’ as I want to make my bulk as lean as possible so it’s really important for me to not jump to the wrong conclusions. 

My training, including cardio volume, has been VERY consistent throughout this whole reverse diet phase. 

I’m using the average method of calculating my weight but my daily weight fluctuates so much that it can be hard to make sense even of the average over 1-2 weeks. 

For example my weight this week has ranged anywhere from 145.5lb to 149.7lb - so to use an average of the week to inform a decision about whether I’m in a net surplus/deficit seems a bit dangerous and easy to draw the wrong conclusions.

First off, have checked the FAQ info, but not sure it answers my question really...

I’m looking to improve my breakfast game. I currently eat 2 x eggs quickly scrambled, and a shake (oats, blueberries, yoghurt, banana, protein powder, peanut butter, water).

However, my breakfast appetite has been increasing over the years. Feel like I could be eating more at this time.

But we all know breakfast is early and annoying to do every day. So I want to make something that can last pretty much all week (or at least a few days). Get up early one morning and just do the prep. That I can make one big pot of (I have a big Le Creuset).

I saw Alan Thrall’s mountain man breakfast and it inspired me. I was thinking: sausages, potatoes, onions, peppers, and then lots of eggs all over the top. Maybe some cheese.

,gainit,"Edit: Don't know why I didn't think of it earlier, Focalin XR lasts 12 hours, eat a big meal before 8 am and after 8 pm. And switch up the food as well.

I am somewhere between an ecto and mesomorph build wise, I am 145 (used to be 135) [trying to reach 150] pounds and I am 5' 10.5"" I have a fast metabolism and I'd force oatmeal shakes and make sure at least half the stuff I eat is healthy, I do light full body strength in the morning every day for  around 30 minutes. I used to and love running a lot and I'd force eat more depending on how much I ran, it seems it would be impossible to do on top of being a hard gained on appetite suppression medication. 

I heard Eddie Hall or Brian Shaw I forgot, but one of them said while they are eating they have to hype themselves up and listen to music to eat, because they have to eat so much to maintain their weights.

Edit: I am asking for advice on what fellow hardgainers or appetite suppressed people do it gain weight, so I can have a few more ideas. I gave traits about myself that everyone is trying to debunk or prove wrong rather than help the main issue, I said between ecto and meso morph because most of my traits are of both. I am not directly saying ecto is a bad thing or making a big excuse to stop trying to eat. I like running so I like the skinnier build, but my jobs demand more. I can handle them now, but I want them to become easier and not wear down joints as bad. So I wanted to put on 15-25 pounds.

I am aware we are technically a mix of all 3 but them 2 are more prominent for me.

And switch up the food as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am somewhere between an ecto and mesomorph build wise, I am 145 (used to be 135) [trying to reach 150] pounds and I am 5&amp;#39; 10.5&amp;quot; I have a fast metabolism and I&amp;#39;d force oatmeal shakes and make sure at least half the stuff I eat is healthy, I do light full body strength in the morning every day for  around 30 minutes. I used to and love running a lot and I&amp;#39;d force eat more depending on how much I ran, it seems it would be impossible to do on top of being a hard gained on appetite suppression medication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard Eddie Hall or Brian Shaw I forgot, but one of them said while they are eating they have to hype themselves up and listen to music to eat, because they have to eat so much to maintain their weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I am asking for advice on what fellow hardgainers or appetite suppressed people do it gain weight, so I can have a few more ideas. I gave traits about myself that everyone is trying to debunk or prove wrong rather than help the main issue, I said between ecto and meso morph because most of my traits are of both. I am not directly saying ecto is a bad thing or making a big excuse to stop trying to eat. I like running so I like the skinnier build, but my jobs demand more. I can handle them now, but I want them to become easier and not wear down joints as bad. So I wanted to put on 15-25 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware we are technically a mix of all 3 but them 2 are more prominent for me. If you only think you can be one morph, than you must share most traits with 1 morph and barely the other 2 I&amp;#39;d assume.

,gainit,"Hi guys,

I am just wondering if anyone here has has issues with general stomach issues related to eating. For me, this is general discomfort and mild nasuea when I eat, sometimes with a little acid reflux on the side.

I know there are some types of foods that are tougher on the stomach, and I have done some research on things that should be avoided. The difficulty here is a lot of those things are high calorie/fat foods that are good for bulking. I have also heard that spreading eating across smaller meals throughout the day can help, but I think it is fair to say that for most people this is difficult to do with a regular work/life schedule. I don't have a crippling problem, I don't vomit after eating or wake up vomiting from heartburn. Its just bothersome enough that I have difficulty eating 3000+ calories in a day.

I work from home from 8-5pm and gotta get OUT of this chair more!! I'm in shape but in a huge rut for 3 months.

Here's my idea:

Start an interval timer right at 8am that will **loop all day**:

* **15 minutes**: Work (day job) for 15 straight minutes without interruption \*BEEP\*
* **1 minute**: Get up and Lift/Exercise  

   * Using dumbbells right behind my chair.
   * Can be any exercise as long as I'm hustling the entire minute. Will likely alternate between either a) same exercise all day or b) alternate muscle groups every cycle
   * Lifting for 1 minute is about 8-12 reps
* **4 minutes**: Remaining 4 minutes for break/bathroom/leisure

Then loop. So I would get 3 hard minutes of exercise every 60 minutes.

**8 hour work day = 24 minutes of exercise.**

Howdy fellas, wanted to update my progress from about 6 months ago, definitely been on and off of training and eating, but also DEFINITELY been gaining mass. 
Eating less sets me back more than training less I would say, find it funny that a cheat day for me is when I only have 2 meals all day, the way my appetite is naturally.

The before photo literally scares me when I look at it, tbf I was suffering from some health issues but regardless, IF YOU’RE SKINNY EAT BIG AND TRAIN BIG, you’ll love and thank your self later.
I hopped out of the shower and literally just had to admire my progress I’m so thankful for learning about intricacies of caloric intake and workout programs on this sub. 
I’m super lean rn in terms of fat, just holding some water weight due to creatine. I’d say I’m actually about 73.5kg

Right now my numbers are going up in the weight room, but I’m only pushing 2500 calories, so I’d def say lean bulking which is exhausting- I’m sleeping for 10 hours minimum but I feel great. I’m trying to move into more intermediate/ advanced programs as I’ve just been sticking to PPL routine, any suggestions are appreciated?!

I didn't work out pretty much at all the entire summer of 2020. Gains are from basically 10 months in the gym spread out over a bit over a year. 

Lifts: 

Bench- 265

Squat- 315

Deadlift- 425

Overhead press- 145

&amp;#x200B;

Diet: Lots of pop tarts, peanut butter, cake, etc on top of the daily eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and tendies. 

Routine: Legs, back, chest. Don't really hit shoulders that much. Core mixed into leg day (sometimes). 1 day off a week. 

Going forward: up the intensity on leg day. For sure feel that I can put a few more pounds on my legs pretty easily to pick me up to 200. If I can clean up my diet but then again pop tarts taste good so probably not. Mixing in some cardio will also be nice but I like doing that from sports which are currently shut down. I May go back into rowing if I can get on the water but that won't be for a month or two. Current lifting goals are 5 plate deadlift, 4 plate squat, 3 plate bench press. Hopefully by end of summer.

,gainit,"Hello all,

I'm currently on 5/3/1, and I did one day so far. I have DL and OHP today.

I was curious about the % of TMax it has you do. For the % it has to start at 40%. I cut that out, because that's barely a warmup. 

It gets as high as 85% TMax for 1xAMRAP with a minimum of 5. For squats, that was tough, but I banged out 7. I think Squats, it worked well, absolutely killed me. 

For Bench, it was almost too easy. Sure, I felt the burn, but banging them out was way too easy. For the 85% AMRAP, I did 11. Should I increase my TMAX or retest my 1RM? I thought it was accurate, but maybe it's not. 

We'll see how DL goes today. My max DL is 425, and I've been doing 3x5 of 365lb. Switching to this, I'm worried it'll be too easy, and at the EOM when I HOPE to have added 25lb to my lifts, I'm worried, it won't have increased as much as it could.

So, my question is:

Should I increase my TMax or %'s, or will 5/3/1 in this fashion, following the plan, actually increase my 1RM, because if I had to guess going by my bench, I'd say no.

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll see how DL goes today. My max DL is 425, and I&amp;#39;ve been doing 3x5 of 365lb. Switching to this, I&amp;#39;m worried it&amp;#39;ll be too easy, and at the EOM when I HOPE to have added 25lb to my lifts, I&amp;#39;m worried, it won&amp;#39;t have increased as much as it could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I increase my TMax or %&amp;#39;s, or will 5/3/1 in this fashion, following the plan, actually increase my 1RM, because if I had to guess going by my bench, I&amp;#39;d say no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks all!&lt;/p&gt;

I used a calorie measurement tool according to which I should eat 2500 calories per day. I have been following this diet which I have shared below. However, my daily average is around 2200 calories.

I am Indian male, 5'7"" weighing 73Kgs currently. My current body fat percentage is around 23.8%. Age is 27.

When I started 5 months ago my weight was around 67Kgs, with a body fat percentage of 19%. My tummy has also increased by 4 inches in such a short time. I believe I am gaining more fat than muscles. I had to stop so I don't gain any further weight and belly.

I don't want to go on a bulk diet and then go for a cut. I will be happy if my muscles build slowly over time. I am not aiming for a bodybuilder look. Just want to look lean.

I have used three methods to arrive at the average fat percentage: Fat caliper, navy method, and Mi Body Weight scale which has a fat% measuring tool. My fat percentage is the average of the three reading given above.

,gainit,"Hey folks, what with gyms being sporadically shut down every few months because of the pandemic, I'm sure a lot of you have a fairly solid plan b at home to keep the gain train rolling during lockdowns.

I'm no exception. I developed a workout, named ""death by pullups"" that I like to do on one of my pull days during the week. It added notable width to my lats in 10 weeks and I got way stronger at hauling my body vertically through space.

A few caveats to this: 

×I recommend warming your shoulders up extremely thoroughly prior to each time you do this. Scap depressions on a pull up bar, band pullaparts, low intensity band assisted pullups. Whatever you need to do.

×Run this progression linearly for maybe 8 weeks, then take a break. Do something else for your back work for a month. Then go back to it if you like. This can be stressful on the forearms and could lead to tendonitis of you do it for too long. I don't have a multi grip pull up bar at present, I suspect that if one did you could run the workout progression for longer.

*I do not recommend running this if you aren't already quite good at pullups. This is meant as a method to add goals for the intermediate ""puller"" to progress size and strength in a short period of time. Good form is of course a pre requisite, be honest with how you count reps. 

*The volume below may seem daunting. Trust me, if I can do it with very average genetics, you can too . Just remember to work hard and get that one more rep. As the plan dictates that you start with high weight and move down as the reps increase, the CNS is so fired up that the lighter weights seem so much easier even when the muscles are fatigued. 

×I don't recommend doing much else in the gym on the day you run this. Your lats are shattered, your grip is cooked, your bis are sautéed. 

Test your all out max bodyweight pullups /chinups before your run this. Then again after. I'd be shocked if you honestly don't add 10-12 reps. 


The programme is as follows:

5 rep sets:
-Start off with your weaker grip (overhand/underhand). 
-Pick a weight where the first set is an RPE 8ish
-Try your best to get 5 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, rinse and repeat. 
-If you get all 50 reps, add a small amount of weight next week. 

8 rep sets:
-Go back to your weak grip. 
-Pick a weight where you can get 8 reps, again RPE 8.
-Do 4 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, do 4 sets. 
-if all sets are completed, add a rep to as many sets as you can next time (only increase weight on these sets once you can do sets across with 10 reps). 

Bodyweight:
-You're beginning to see a pattern? 
- 3 sets, 12 reps on weak grip. 
-Rinse, repeat, strong grip. 

Band assisted 
-1 burnout set with your weak grip. 
-1 burnout set with your strong grip.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m no exception. I developed a workout, named &amp;quot;death by pullups&amp;quot; that I like to do on one of my pull days during the week. It added notable width to my lats in 10 weeks and I got way stronger at hauling my body vertically through space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few caveats to this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;×I recommend warming your shoulders up extremely thoroughly prior to each time you do this. Scap depressions on a pull up bar, band pullaparts, low intensity band assisted pullups. Whatever you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;×Run this progression linearly for maybe 8 weeks, then take a break. Do something else for your back work for a month. Then go back to it if you like. This can be stressful on the forearms and could lead to tendonitis of you do it for too long. I don&amp;#39;t have a multi grip pull up bar at present, I suspect that if one did you could run the workout progression for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*I do not recommend running this if you aren&amp;#39;t already quite good at pullups. This is meant as a method to add goals for the intermediate &amp;quot;puller&amp;quot; to progress size and strength in a short period of time. Good form is of course a pre requisite, be honest with how you count reps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*The volume below may seem daunting. Trust me, if I can do it with very average genetics, you can too . Just remember to work hard and get that one more rep. As the plan dictates that you start with high weight and move down as the reps increase, the CNS is so fired up that the lighter weights seem so much easier even when the muscles are fatigued. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;×I don&amp;#39;t recommend doing much else in the gym on the day you run this. Your lats are shattered, your grip is cooked, your bis are sautéed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test your all out max bodyweight pullups /chinups before your run this. Then again after. I&amp;#39;d be shocked if you honestly don&amp;#39;t add 10-12 reps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 rep sets:
-Start off with your weaker grip (overhand/underhand). 
-Pick a weight where the first set is an RPE 8ish
-Try your best to get 5 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, rinse and repeat. 
-If you get all 50 reps, add a small amount of weight next week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 rep sets:
-Go back to your weak grip. 
-Pick a weight where you can get 8 reps, again RPE 8.
-Do 4 sets. 
-Switch to your stronger grip, do 4 sets. 
-if all sets are completed, add a rep to as many sets as you can next time (only increase weight on these sets once you can do sets across with 10 reps). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bodyweight:
-You&amp;#39;re beginning to see a pattern? 
- 3 sets, 12 reps on weak grip. 
-Rinse, repeat, strong grip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Band assisted 
-1 burnout set with your weak grip. 
-1 burnout set with your strong grip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re done. Leave the gym. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s simple, it&amp;#39;s hard, it&amp;#39;s not terribly fun but it gets results. I went from bodyweight+25kg for 5 rep max sets on chinups to adding 37.5kg. Bodyweight chins went from 17 reps to 33.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hey,

Been messing around I’m the gym for about a year (3 x 30min sessions a week, machines / cables) and have actually seen nice progress with my body.

However, feel i could genuinely look about 3 times better if I took it more seriously e.g. 4 hours a week and did proper compound lifts with free-weights.

But, I’m not going to lie, the free-weight section intimidates me a bit. I was thinking I could ask a PT to do a few sessions with me to ‘ease me in’. But wouldn’t want to (read: can’t afford) to continue. Would they do this? And even worth it in your opinion? Could help psychologically, but also in terms of doing the actual exercises properly. Or should I just stop being a p__sy?

Bonus question: any super simple compound lift guide? I’ve heard of the 5x5. I want to focus on (mainly) upper body. Would this work?

,gainit,"Hi! I've got a question... 

My current routine is chest+back/rest/arms+legs+shoulders/rest/repeat. 

Do higher volume and I like to do one drop set per muscle group at the end of every workout, I like the pump and the burn and the control with the lower weight at the end..... 

 My chest and back day consists of 4 compound movements each, 4x pushing 4xpulling. At the last exercise of chest and back I strip the weight off and do drop sets. So the volume and the stress on the muscle is fairly high. Then 48 hours later when I train arms, I have two exercises for bicep and two for tricep, on the second exercise, again, I do drop sets. 

That means arms are getting hit with pretty high volume every other day. 

I like that routine, but sometimes I think if I would just do push/pull, each arm muscle would have 4 days of rest, vs 48 hours, getting hit directly and indirectly all the time.

I&amp;#39;ve got a question... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current routine is chest+back/rest/arms+legs+shoulders/rest/repeat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do higher volume and I like to do one drop set per muscle group at the end of every workout, I like the pump and the burn and the control with the lower weight at the end..... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My chest and back day consists of 4 compound movements each, 4x pushing 4xpulling. At the last exercise of chest and back I strip the weight off and do drop sets. So the volume and the stress on the muscle is fairly high. Then 48 hours later when I train arms, I have two exercises for bicep and two for tricep, on the second exercise, again, I do drop sets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means arms are getting hit with pretty high volume every other day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that routine, but sometimes I think if I would just do push/pull, each arm muscle would have 4 days of rest, vs 48 hours, getting hit directly and indirectly all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My arms aren&amp;#39;t that great by the way. Do you think I should switch to push pull at a frequency of every other day?&lt;/p&gt;

Since quarantine/lockdown keeps getting extended I'm finally deciding on getting some adjustable dumbells for bulking up! I currently have a bench with a 7kg barbell and some light plates, but it's all outside in my open garage and we've just had our first snowy weather come through. This has resulted in the weather being below at least -1 degrees Celcius which is simply too cold for me to even bother working out. The stuff is also some old rusty stuff from my dad's past job that we picked up.

I'm severely underweight, (18 years old, 183cm/46kg), and I don't have space for a squat rack inside our home. Therefore I thought, that a pair of adjustable dumbells would be good enough for a 6-day ppl routine while staying at home. Is that true?

I live in Denmark/Europe and I'm willing to pay whatever price for them as long as they are the best I can get. I don't care about the cost as long as they are able to get me from my current weight and up +10kg at least if lockdown keeps going for long enough! I've already trained 1 year before but an eating disorder hit me and I lost from 64kg (March 2020, lockdown start) to my current weight of 46kg (This date).

I also have a bench that is kinda old, but it goes from decline to 90 degrees with a removable lock mechanism.

Currently i’m 6’3” at ~182 lbs. Not sure on my bodyfat %. 

With quarantine round 2 happening its given me time to reassess where i’m at and I figure it’s a good time to plot my plan for when gyms reopen to stop fucking around since this time off from the gym has made me reflect on my gainit goals and given me all the motivation to grind hard for it when they reopen.

I’ve just been spending quarantine eating at a maintenance calorie wise with high protein to try and preserve the bit of muscle I have built over the years while doing some resistance band stuff. But when I can get back into my gym and have access to actual decent gym equipment (which should be soon), i’d love some advice on any routines you can recommend and any other advice for gaining hypertrophy. 

My focus for the next year at least is to try and put on some serious size and I definitely am focused on hypertrophy since my goal is primarily (and pretty much exclusively) aesthetics. Prior to this most recent lockdown in my area I had 4 months of gym time and I was doing a 4 day split made for me by an online trainer and I was making some decent progress on that. Just trying to debate whether I continue on that once my gym reopens or if I should switch to a program that any of you with similar goals to me have had great success with. 

I find I tend to get a bit of analysis paralysis when it comes to routines and customizing them to my goals or areas where i'm lacking so I could definitely use some advice there. Also, how long should someone stay on a specific routine for? Sometimes I see people say no longer than 12 weeks, othertimes it's when you stop progressing. See, there's my analysis paralysis again lol. Am I overthinking things? A common piece of advice I see is ""the best routine is one you can stick to"" but then on the other hand I see info about how you shouldn't stick to a specific routine for too long. So, i'm a bit confused.

Currently &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/qFk50lL""&gt;I look like this,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/2uA5igI""&gt;I want to look like this.&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/malhxsn0mxp51.jpg?width=950&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=827f7109fd7adb79c630c8cef11dc21c5bf2d043""&gt;like this.&lt;/a&gt; What can I do to get there (besides tanning lol)? Currently i’m 6’3” at ~182 lbs. Not sure on my bodyfat %. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With quarantine round 2 happening its given me time to reassess where i’m at and I figure it’s a good time to plot my plan for when gyms reopen to stop fucking around since this time off from the gym has made me reflect on my gainit goals and given me all the motivation to grind hard for it when they reopen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just been spending quarantine eating at a maintenance calorie wise with high protein to try and preserve the bit of muscle I have built over the years while doing some resistance band stuff. But when I can get back into my gym and have access to actual decent gym equipment (which should be soon), i’d love some advice on any routines you can recommend and any other advice for gaining hypertrophy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My focus for the next year at least is to try and put on some serious size and I definitely am focused on hypertrophy since my goal is primarily (and pretty much exclusively) aesthetics. Prior to this most recent lockdown in my area I had 4 months of gym time and I was doing a 4 day split made for me by an online trainer and I was making some decent progress on that. Just trying to debate whether I continue on that once my gym reopens or if I should switch to a program that any of you with similar goals to me have had great success with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find I tend to get a bit of analysis paralysis when it comes to routines and customizing them to my goals or areas where i&amp;#39;m lacking so I could definitely use some advice there. Also, how long should someone stay on a specific routine for? Sometimes I see people say no longer than 12 weeks, othertimes it&amp;#39;s when you stop progressing. See, there&amp;#39;s my analysis paralysis again lol. Am I overthinking things? A common piece of advice I see is &amp;quot;the best routine is one you can stick to&amp;quot; but then on the other hand I see info about how you shouldn&amp;#39;t stick to a specific routine for too long. So, i&amp;#39;m a bit confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice you guys can share would be awesome I seriously do need it. Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hello lifters.

I'm coming off a cut and will be getting back into the gym for the first time in damn near a year. I'm planning on running the series of programs outlined by u/MythicalStrength ([6 Months of Eating and Training For Mass](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/j5q2ez/6_months_of_eating_and_training_for_mass_laid_out/))

I'm curious if there's anyone here who would like to run the program with me. Feel like it would be a lot more fun to run a program with a group of people rather than alone -- also I miss human interaction.

In any case, if you're interested drop a comment below. Planned start date is Monday, March 1st.

deadlift: 100 for reps to 245 for reps

squat: 85 for reps to 200 for reps

One issue I've ran into throughout my journey is my grip strength feels really weak. My 1rp in Dec 2018 was 300lbs, but my callus peeled off during this rep and it hurt a lot, even though I felt like I could have lifted 315 at least. Yesterday I was deadlifting 255 x 5 and my callus started to peel off again, so I had to stop. I feel like my grip is the limiting factor, because my the hardest part about standing up during the lift is not the standing its making sure the bar doesn't fall out.

Are straps a good idea? I feel like I'm still at a relatively low weighted deadlift for them and don't want to become dependent on them. I don't use a belt either for that reason.

,gainit,"Hi,

So, I've been bulking since the start of the year and I've gone from 152 lbs to 156 lbs over the past month. Over the past week my lifts haven't been going up. Rather than feeling fresh, I feel tired and sore when going into a workout.

Currently, I am eating between 2600-2800 cals a day. I am 25 years old, 156 lb and 6'2. At 152 lbs I was 7.1 % bf, but I don't know about now. I eat over 200 grams of protein a day.

I've been gaining on my current calories, just because I only get any exercise when I go to the gym. Otherwise, I am sitting down from the moment I wake-up.

My workout routine is a modified version of the 6-day reddit PPL.

**Push day (A/B):**

4x5-8 Bench press/OHP

3x8-12 OHP/BP

3x8-12 Incline

3x8-12 DB press

3x8 Skullcrushers ss w/ lat raises

3x8-12 tricep extension machine ss w/ lat raises

**Pull Day:**

3x8-12 Pullups 

4x5-10 Pendlay row 

3x8-12 Wide pulldowns

3x8-12 Chest supported row

4x8-12 Face Pulls ss w/ barbell curls

4x8-12 DB preacher curls

**Leg day:**

70 Bw squats

4x8-12 BB Squats

4x8-12 Stiff legged Deadlifts

3x8-12 burpees as high as possible

&amp;#x200B;

Every other day I hit abs, with 3xmax leg raises followed by 4x8-12 cable crunches.

Right now I can do bench for 125x7, squats for 135x12, deadlifts for 205x12

**Is that too much volume, or are my calories just too low? I am confused, because I've been gaining weight and I can see a physical difference, but my lifts have not been progressing. My cals seem rather low, when I compare my calories to other's bulking cals.**

I'd prefer to keep up with the volume, because I really look forward to going to the gym. The only thing that is sucky is that I am not progressing in the weights I've been doing, and I am sore before starting a workout.

&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#39;ve been bulking since the start of the year and I&amp;#39;ve gone from 152 lbs to 156 lbs over the past month. Over the past week my lifts haven&amp;#39;t been going up. Rather than feeling fresh, I feel tired and sore when going into a workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am eating between 2600-2800 cals a day. I am 25 years old, 156 lb and 6&amp;#39;2. At 152 lbs I was 7.1 % bf, but I don&amp;#39;t know about now. I eat over 200 grams of protein a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been gaining on my current calories, just because I only get any exercise when I go to the gym. Otherwise, I am sitting down from the moment I wake-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My workout routine is a modified version of the 6-day reddit PPL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push day (A/B):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x5-8 Bench press/OHP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 OHP/BP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Incline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 DB press&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8 Skullcrushers ss w/ lat raises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 tricep extension machine ss w/ lat raises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull Day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Pullups &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x5-10 Pendlay row &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Wide pulldowns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 Chest supported row&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8-12 Face Pulls ss w/ barbell curls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8-12 DB preacher curls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leg day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70 Bw squats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8-12 BB Squats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4x8-12 Stiff legged Deadlifts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3x8-12 burpees as high as possible&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every other day I hit abs, with 3xmax leg raises followed by 4x8-12 cable crunches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I can do bench for 125x7, squats for 135x12, deadlifts for 205x12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that too much volume, or are my calories just too low? I am confused, because I&amp;#39;ve been gaining weight and I can see a physical difference, but my lifts have not been progressing. My cals seem rather low, when I compare my calories to other&amp;#39;s bulking cals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d prefer to keep up with the volume, because I really look forward to going to the gym. The only thing that is sucky is that I am not progressing in the weights I&amp;#39;ve been doing, and I am sore before starting a workout.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"First of all i would like to thank everyone thats gonna read this. Its a huge help for me and i dont take it for granted in the slightest.  I will list my shit, and at the bottom i will write a couple of questions. Also i tried to format it nice, so u can read it better. I hope this helps.

Okay so im **6'5""** and i started to really eat way more like 3 months ago. Since then ive gained like 10 pounds, so now im at **175lbs**. I believe these are called noob gains tho. 


**My diet:**


My Tdee should be somewhere around 3000 and i pretty much eat somewhere around 4000kcal every single day.

These consists of:

600 oat cereals


700 pbj


600 for a snack (burritos, walnuts, or egg sandwiches)


700 for dinner (most of the time i eat rice or pasta with some extra shit like beans or turkey and some vegetables)


1200 shake with oats, banana, ice cream, milk, chia seeds and olive oil



I think this is considered a dirty bulk. 



**My workout:**

Its kinda scuffed i think. Due to lockdown i train at home, but i train 6 days of the week. I am doing low intensity and high rep workouts, as i only have 2 dumbbells, each with 22pounds. My routine is to start Monday with workout A, then B, then A, then B, then A, then B, then rest.





**Workout A:**

4x 25 pushups


4x 15 bicep curls


4x 15 dumbbell benchpress on the ground (22lbs each)


4x 6 shoulder dumbbell shoulder raises (22lbs each)


4x 15 dumbbell rows (22lbs each)


4x 15 weighted bench dips (44lbs on thighs)


**Workout B:**

4x 15 weighted squads (22lbs on each shoulder)


4x 15 sumo deadlifts (44lbs)


4x 15 romanian deadlifts (44lbs)


4x 15 (per leg) weighted bulgarian split squads, (22lbs)


4x 15 lying hamstring curls (22lbs)



On all days im doing 3 kinds of planks 3 times for 30 seconds






**So my questions are:**

1. how good is my diet, and do i have to eat more after gaining some weight?
2. how is my workout, and how far will low weights get me?
3. is gaining around 15pounds in the next 6 months a realistic goal?

Okay, now to the main question/issue:

I've been trying to find ways to consume more of my calorie carb split (I do 35 prot 35 fat 30 carb) as complex/low GI carbs, since I find that the simple stuff (maltodextrin-heavy mass gainer shakes) makes me really lethargic when I consume it in high doses (plus I'm prone to prediabetes so I wanna avoid that y'know). Issue is, all the complex carbs I try to consume in the same amount as the simple ones are just so fucking tiring to eat. Like a solid hour of eating oats, or lentils, or brown rice, like jesus christ it's so slow. I think the fibre just makes it so time consuming to eat, and yeah it might be more healthy but fuck. Also it fills me up which makes eating more hard since I have GERD/acid reflux. lol.

Also, I don't wanna be eating like 400% of my daily fibre and having rock solid shits every few hours.

,gainit,"Hey all

I recently maxed my deadlift at 425lb and my bench at 215lb. 

Today, I hit 335lb for squat. That puts me only 25lb away from joining the 1000lb club at my gym. Pretty good for 7 months of lifting.


Until today, I have been primary lifting for hypertrophy. However, I have one month left until I start my cut. 8 months of bulking is enough for now.

I would like to hit that extra 25lb between now and the end of the month, which means focusing my lifts and eating on strength gains. 

First, is it possible to add that last 25lb in one month? Second, on top of a three day strength program, should I add another 500kcal to my daily diet?

I'm at a surplus of 500kcal right now and eating 3,250 ATM. This would put me at 3750.

,gainit,"Hey all, 

Been lifting hard for 7 months since July 1st. June of '19 to July of '20 was basically just cutting and running to lose weight. 

Dropped to 189lb, and was ready to physically start packing on muscle. So I ate at 500cal surplus, dropped to a 250kcal surplus, then went back, when I realized that ""hey... I need to eat more food"".

At a 3,250kcal intake right now. Usually get slighty above that, just make sure to never be below it. 

Strength gains definitely saw an increase after the increase food. 

My 1RMs are currently:

Bench: 215lb - Definitely my weakest lift. I have a training weight of 160lb for 4x8. I could definitely be doing better, but it's my first year lifting so whatever. 

Squat: 280lb - This is just a guess, since my training weight is 245lb for 5x5. I don't generally lift for strength, just hypertrophy. This and DL are there to make me stronger. I'm scared to try a 1RM for squat. Which is silly, because I have my safety rails right there.

EDIT: 1RMed the other day at 335. Super happy.

Dead Lift: 425lb - This, while not as amazing as it could be, is my strongest lift. I definitely had more progress on DL than anything else, and I love doing it. Currently, my training weight is 365lb for 3x5, and my 425lb was a very wobbly lift, but I got it up. Started using a belt recently. Made a huge difference.

As the title says my 14YO started lifting in our home gym recently. We are all for it, it's great.

However I'm a bit concerned with his repeated requests for different supplements. First it started with protein powder which we had no problem with, then witamins, fish oil - which was fine as well. EDIT - the supplements I mentioned above I'm totally fine with. Those below worry me a bit. 

However now he's asking for creatine and caffeine because he 'needs energy when doing his morning workout'. For the time being we said no to that. He claims that he's done all the research, however I wanted a second opinion.

On top of that there's a niggling thought in the back of my mind saying: 'he's trying to solve every problem he has with a supplement'.

Are we just being overprotective or is this a legit concern.

,gainit,"Disclaimer:  Even though my opinion doesn't matter, I am going to give it to you anyway.  I'm not some record breaker or an overly successful entrepreneur.  I'm just some dude next door that lifts.

Are you a goal-oriented lifter?  Sure you are, you plan your training in advance and probably have a specific way to make sure you're recovering enough e.g. calories, macros, sleep.  The first thing we should ask ourselves in the gym is why are we doing this?  If it does not serve a specific purpose then discard it, Jim Wendler taught me that, but he also taught me AMRAPs, but what purpose do they serve?

AMRAPs serve 2 purposes that I can think of: To do the exercise to complete exhaustion and to measure a repetition max.  I will be focusing on the first one, as going for a rep PR is testing, and training is different than demonstrating. I spent a solid year testing my lifts all of the time and seeing what I could put up instead of lifting what I KNOW I could put up.  This resulted in negative progress and it's a lesson you don't have to learn the hard way, I already did that for you.  

So we are taking a movement to at least technical failure, which is usually done on the last set of an exercise., but how often are you doing that?  Every week?  Every workout? At the end of every exercise?    There are clear benefits we get from training to failure, but you should ask yourself if the pros outweigh the cons.  You will benefit similarly by training close to failure, but it won't cost you as much.  Say you AMRAP the last set of your first exercise in the gym, what do you think that costs?  What did it cost today?  What about the rest of the week?  How many sets or reps did you lose because of it, and likely more importantly, how badly did the quality of the rest of your work suffer?  Well the answer can't be zero or nothing unless it was an isolation movement done at the end of a workout, but I will bring that up later. I want to focus on AMRAPs for compound lifts you do early in training.  If you AMRAP the last set of bench, what happens to your OHP next?  Some people think they're getting away with it, but everything costs something.  

I'd like to get back to goals, and I am an extreme believer in specific goals and specificity in general.  As I mentioned before, you likely have your training written down already, and you know exactly what exercises you will be doing with how many sets logged before you even touch a barbell.  Even if you are using rate of perceived exertion, you have a specific number of reps you want to hit beforehand.  To me, this is undervalued.  Knowing exactly what will be asked of you from the exercise before you approach it is huge; it mentally preps you and tells you the exact amount of effort you will need.  This leads to higher quality sets.  AMRAPs are aimless, you might have an idea of where you'll land, but it's not specific enough, and when things aren't specific enough, they can burden you psychologically. I'm not sure the best way to word it, but if you have trained using AMRAPs I'm sure you know what I mean.  Instead, train with intention, train on purpose, know exactly what you need to ask of yourself so you can do it with intent.  AMRAPs have an unsure element to them, and when you are unsure, then what exactly is your intent?  You are doing something unspecific, you simply cannot have intentions that are specific enough.  This leads to uncertainty.  Training with uncertainty introduces doubt, which is EXTREMELY self-destructive. Doubt is to the soul what pain is to the body.  Set a very specific target and hit it EVERYTIME.  Prescribing yourself reps and hitting all of those reps builds confidence, so you won't have a good reason to doubt yourself.  Your body can only do what your mind tells it to, so train that too.

There is a secret great goal setters have, they know exactly what they want, when they want it, and how they're going to get there.  Saying ""I  want to gain weight"" is good, but we can do better.  ""I want to gain 15lbs by June"", now THAT puts some iron sights on your m4.  Furthermore, you put more on the line with specificity, you know exactly how to approach it.  You can break it down by the month or even week to get more specific and this holds you more accountable more often, especially with a deadline.

Now is AMRAPing your last set of tricep pushdowns or lateral raises going to damage your recovery enough to matter?  Probably not, but I would still argue that having a more specific purpose in ALL of your training is more beneficial to you psychologically, which is definitely the most overlooked thing when it comes to training in general.  

AMRAPs are fine as a metric, as a way to find a repetition max when you are testing.  I do not think it should be a strength training staple though, I find it to be poor mental hygiene.",t2_fb0wp,False,,0,False,Should AMRAPs be a strength TRAINING staple?,[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_l9e369,False,dark,0.64,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1612134618.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer:  Even though my opinion doesn&amp;#39;t matter, I am going to give it to you anyway.

Saying &amp;quot;I  want to gain weight&amp;quot; is good, but we can do better.  &amp;quot;I want to gain 15lbs by June&amp;quot;, now THAT puts some iron sights on your m4.  Furthermore, you put more on the line with specificity, you know exactly how to approach it.  You can break it down by the month or even week to get more specific and this holds you more accountable more often, especially with a deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is AMRAPing your last set of tricep pushdowns or lateral raises going to damage your recovery enough to matter?  Probably not, but I would still argue that having a more specific purpose in ALL of your training is more beneficial to you psychologically, which is definitely the most overlooked thing when it comes to training in general.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMRAPs are fine as a metric, as a way to find a repetition max when you are testing.  I do not think it should be a strength training staple though, I find it to be poor mental hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Greetings Once Again Gainers,

After another 5 day stretch of weird shifts at work with lots of downtime, I've been pouring through the archives over at Physical Culture Study (fantastic website) and read through every single article on weight gaining.  I wanted to pass on some of that knowledge to you in an easy to parse through topic here on the r/gainit.  I cannot personally vouch for any of these approaches, as I've not had the time to employ them, but they come from some of the best in the business and, if nothing else, can serve as a contrast from the now standard ""eat X amount of carbs, Y amount of protein and Z about of fats"" that many of you are failing to find success with.  

Without further ado...

,gainit,"Hi, hope every is doing well. A while ago I posted a progress update on how I went from 54KG to 72kg over a year. I am now 74kg. And I have been stuck here for a while. Obviously, I know to gain weight and break the plateau, but I simply wonder if it's worth it at all. I am hovering at around 3300 calories to maintain. I naturally don't have a big appetite, I had to discipline and force myself to be where I am at today, but I think I reached my breaking point. 

I simply can't take any more food. But on the other hand, I'm still not satisfied with my physique. Well, mostly. If you remember I also ranted about my legs being the only part not developing on par with my upper body so that's why I kept bulking up at 72kg. I thought I could reach 80 but seems to me now insane with how much food I'd have to chuck to get there. So I suppose my legs have to wait a little more.

Now here is what I was thinking and need your advice on this. I'm thinking of doing a cut to re-adjust my calorie intake. Cut back to 70, 68kg. And slowly re-bulking from there. My first bulk was aggressive and that's why I think my calorie intake is so high right now. So I was thinking if I cut and take things slowly again, my calorie intake would readjust. (Idk if I'm brosciencing this lmao.)

,gainit,"Hi,

I am 23M, height 190cm (6ft 3in), 52kg (115 pounds). My BMI is 14.3 which is severely underweight.

Since last week I have started to focus on my diet and I am keeping an account of calories consumed. I was able to consume 2500+ calories/day and my weight increased from 50kg to 52kg in 7 days.

I have gained this weight on a healthy vegan diet - bananas, rice, tofu, soy milk, nuts, veggies, and seeds. On an average per day, I'm consuming high carbs (simple and complex) in excess of 330g, around 60-80g protein intake, and 38g fiber, 40g fat and 99g of sugar. I take Vitamin B12, D3, Omega-3 DHA supplements daily. 

I have done minimal workout at home for 3 days which included squats, plank exercise (tried push-ups but could not do). I am mostly home these days doing desk job, so not much movement. But I go for a walk after dinner. 

My main goal is to reach a healthy BMI (68 kg) first and then increase my weight to the ideal: 80 kg. I do not want to turn all the food I'm consuming into body fat. Therefore, I would like to join the gym and channelize the protein intake into muscle growth. Since I'm quite skinny, I can see bones protruding from my joints and shoulder. Therefore, I am looking to have solid arms, shoulder and calf muscles, for now. Later on I can work on other parts of my body. 

**What do you suggest should I join the gym immediately or do I bulk up for now, hit the 68kg mark, do minimal workout at home, and then later join the gym once I'm in normal BMI region?**

I'm 24M, currently 82.9kg as of this morning, 182cm tall. According to a FitTrack scale I own, I currently sit at 17.4% BF. I was I believe around mid 20s% when I first started losing fat. Recently I've been focusing on also building muscle in the last few months.

As of this coming weekend I am at the end of a 5 week cut, eating initially 2000, now down to 1900 cals a day, 180+g protein, under 50g of fat (usually well under), the rest carbs.

I'm very keen to bulk and get bigger. I don't want to come off a cut and instantly put all that fat back on, but I also want to maximise my muscle growth from the time, energy and effort I'm putting into my workout and diet routine.

People's opinions differ hugely on if I can bulk or not. Many say if you're above 15% BF, which I am, then you need to keep cutting. Some say cut, maintain, cut, maintain, until you're below 15%, then again, bulk. Others say a small, lean bulk over a long time can cause body recomposition.

My question is: In my situation, what would you do? Switch into a lean bulk? Keep cutting, and if so, until when?

Greetings, guys

I can see that everyday some of you good folks make really impressive progress and every single one of you has been an inspiration of mine through this process. So, first of all THANK YOU.

&amp;#x200B;

Little backstory,

I used to be really obese, by obese I mean I was around 100kg of pure fat, no exercise, wasn't moving my body at all and spent my entire days in house playing video games as a teen.

Decided that I have to stop my negative habits if I didn't plan to die by 25 of heart disease or diabetes.

Have to admit that it was really tough process losing all of that weight, not that much physically as mentally challenging it was.

Days, weeks, months went by and eventually with all the hard work I lost that weight. I lost around 66lbs if I recall correctly.

And there came the new phase, the new ""SKINNY ME"".

Pretty much, the only thing about being skinny that I liked is that every clothing piece suited me pretty decent in comparison and the fact that I made it to goal that I set for myself.

Being skinny for some time actually brought up that feeling of being really weak, felt really low with libido too. Didn't feel that strong at all.

So, I decided to step up my game and gain some muscle. And, oh boy, I didn't even realize how hard it actually was. Like, the eating part is probably the hardest. Forcing your body to eat and shoving that food up your mouth is really the worst. Peanut butter is life savior in that case tho.

After few months of peanut butter and feeling sick I came to realization that I actually gained pretty decent amount of weight and when I think about it, now I feel really really strong in comparison when I was skinny.

Don't really like that part where I gained a bit of fat, but the fact that I feel a lot stronger and physically better is compensating in that case.

Overall, I'm pretty happy where I'm at right now.

Keep up the good work guys!

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure many of the reviews/testimonies I see online claiming people gain weight extremely quick via shakes may be borderline unreasonable and fake too.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"I am seeing a lot of submissions asking if they should do X if they only have very little weight. While this is not optimal (hate that word, especially for lifting), there are dozens of ways around this.

I usually train with light weights, because I get most of my programming from the 5/3/1 Forever book, and Jim has you base your numbers off of your training max, which is 85% of your 'actual' 1rm. So most of my strength work is around 55-85% of my real 1rm, so it's absurdly light given the rep scheme. This allows me to put a lot of focus into each set and do every rep with intention. I never have the ""let's just get this over with"" attitude, and you won't either if you do your work with intention. Move the bar with a purpose.

**Tempo**
This is my go to; my favorite dance move. I incorporate brief pauses or purposely slow down the eccentric to make the set more challenging. I also like to put a lot of force into the concentric, so if I were to put 20 more pounds on the bar it would still fly up. 

**Rest periods**
Cut them shorter. I was doing 10x5 squats a couple weeks ago and I decided I was going to rest only 30 seconds because it felt very light and I was on my game. I don't use this one as much, because resting let's me visualize the next set and helps me train on purpose. But it's effective and just another form of progressive overload.

**Increase Frequency**
Have you heard of easy strength by dan john? If you don't know who that is then go read about him, he has an old school approach to lifting and is incredibly wise. But easy strength is essentially picking 5 movements and doing them everyday. Ultra high frequency, low intensity and volume. It worked very well for me after I took a hiatus from lifting and returned. 

**Increase volume**
This is an easy fix to low intensity, but I always add a set before increasing reps because it's easier and ensures you're doing more quality work than if you just added a rep to each set. You don't want your 2nd-5th set suffering because you burned yourself out on the first set by jumping the reps too fast.

There are many more approaches to getting stronger/bigger with limited weights such as drop sets or rest:pause, but these are my go tos, and in this specific order.

Will post new photos after I finish this program.

# Back story

I've been skinny my whole life (still am, albeit better than before haha). I'm also in terrible shape (being skinny **does not** equal being fit...and fit I am not...I've gotten sore for days helping a friend move a few moving boxes). It's not that I have an eating disorder or anything, I eat really whatever I want whenever I want to. It's just that ""whenever I want"" seems to be naturally less than most. I don't think about food, I don't crave food...if anything, eating is kind of a nuisance for me. There are countless times I've worked an entire day and have completely forgotten to eat. My friends all ""hate me"" because I ""eat whatever I want"" but in all reality, they're just seeing me at at that moment and not seeing all the other times when I put absolutely zero emphasis on food or making an effort to eat it....I'm just generally not hungry, and when I am, I eat something (""something"" being the operative word, as I don't make an effort to eat either healthy or unhealthy...just ends up being food). I think that's probably my biggest issue (although I didn't know it until I began this whole thing). The reason for saying ""my biggest issue"" is that I've tried gaining muscle (unsuccessfully) a multitude of times throughout my life, all with little to no success. I just assumed I was one of those people who ""can't gain muscle"" and left it at that.

# Why I Began

With the whole pandemic going on, I've been seeing a lot of my face on conference calls and the like. I've had a minor issue with my smile (two teeth are a bit crooked). I figured what better time to get Invisalign than now...I'm not physically at work, when I go out I have to wear a mask, etc. Once I got my trays I thought ""well, what else can I change? I've got to wear these things for 8 months, maybe I can ""tie another goal"" into this one"". I landed on making one last attempt at gaining muscle, but figured I'd go all out (both in researching nutrition and the equipment I'd be using). I figured if after the pandemic is over I can have a nice straight smile and look better physically I could essentially treat the pandemic as my personal ""cocoon"" from which I could emerge a...well, I don't want to call myself a butterfly, but you get the gist yeah?

# Why P90X?

Because I was overwhelmed by all the ""at home lift routines"" and wanted something that I could just simply follow, immediately, and not wonder what to do next.  Also because, probably more importantly, as mentioned previously, I'm in terrible shape. I *wanted* to get straight into a lifting program, but deep down I was pretty damn sure I'd hurt myself almost immediately and that'd be the end of it. I wanted to start with ""Body Beast"" but I figured before starting a lifting regimen I should probably get myself into some sort of shape first. Let my nervous and muscular systems ""learn"" how to work together, learn movements, learn ""form"", etc. Not to mention building some cardiovascular endurance. I've read a LOT about P90X, and while it gets a bad rap from some, it still seemed like overall most people endorse it. Now that I've completed P90X I've moved onto Body Beast.

# Nutrition

I have no problem following a workout program, so I knew that wasn't the crux of my problem (I've followed them religiously in the past and gotten no results...and that lack of results caused me to abandon working out altogether as I relegated myself to the ""permanently skinny club""). I researched a ton and landed on doing a 40/30/30 split (protein/carbs/fat) on about 2300 calories a day. Given my aversion to giving food any amount of effort or time, I needed to make things as simple as possible. So I decided on simply eating the exact same thing, every day, with the exception of dinner (I did make sure that my dinner was always a meat, a starch and a fresh vegetable, but it gave me enough daily variation to have at least one thing different). Every single day my routine went (and is back to going):

* **6:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, quarter cup steel cut oats
* **7:30am** \- workout
* **8:30am** \- 1 scoop whey protein powder, 1 cup chocolate milk, 1 egg, 2 slices bread
* **12:00pm** \- 1/2 cup cottage cheese, homemade salad (romaine, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers), homemade tuna salad (on top of the salad, which consisted of tuna, hard boiled eggs, onions, mayonnaise)
* **2:00pm** \- homemade smoothie (1 cup mixed fruit \[strawberries, blueberries, raspberries\], orange juice, 1% milk, 3ozs mixed nuts \[cashews, walnuts, almonds, pecans, brazil nuts\])
* **5:30pm** \- dinner
* **8/9pm** \- 1 scoop casein protein powder

I ate (and am back to eating) that exact thing every single day. Some of my friends think it's crazy and that they could never do that...but as it turns out, my indifference to food actually helps me on this point. Because I don't really care what I'm eating, *I never care what I'm eating.* It makes no difference to me that it's the same thing, every day. If anything, it's easier, because I don't have to think about it. I ""meal prep"" on Sundays (cut/chop everything for a weeks worth of salads, make a weeks worth of tuna salad, pre-make my smoothies and freeze them in foodsaver bags). The only thing I make ""on the fly"" is my dinner each night.

**If you have a look at the graphs in the photo** I linked to in the beginning of the post, you'll see me immediately begin to lose weight after November 31st (which was the date I finished P90X and then stopped eating the above and working out regularly).

# Equipment

I wanted to put a fair amount of money into this, as yet another reason to keep me sticking with things (if I'm going to spend over $1,000 on something, it'll keep me motivated on days where said motivation might otherwise be lacking). I bought a Wyze scale, an adjustable weight bench, smoothie machine, 3 months worth of protein powder, BeachBody subscription, water bottle and two 71.5lb AtivaFit adjustable dumbells.

# How it Went

Well, personally, I'm happy with the outcome. I only missed 4 days of the workout program, but otherwise stuck with it ""as prescribed"". Some interesting and entirely unexpected things happened that I'm quite happy about. My skin looks a thousand times better...a few wrinkles have all but disappeared. I had a few areas of eczema on my leg and face as well, and they have **completely** vanished (and they've plagued me for years...I purchase hydrocortisone cream once every month or so...and it's literally gone without a trace now). To say ""I feel a thousand times better"" would be a massive understatement. My energy levels are through the roof, I sleep like a dead body, my relationship has benefited from it (wink wink)...it's, well, amazing.

# What Next

After the roughly month I took off (and the weight I unintentionally lost during that time) I decided to give ""Body Beast"" a shot, now having more confidence that I wouldn't injure myself almost immediately. I'd like to see if I can get to 180lbs and then cut some fat off...I'm noticing that while gaining muscle, my body fat percentage climbs right along with it so presumable if/when I can get to 180lbs, I'll have a fair amount of fat to shave off at that point.",t2_z73am,False,,0,False,"[Progress] M/35/5'11"" - 136-&gt;157lbs - 3 Months of at Home Workouts",[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_l4y1lz,False,dark,0.97,,public,220,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,220,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1611638893.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 month progress photo (before and after) - &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/5Lx1Nar.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/5Lx1Nar.jpg&lt;/a&gt; .

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have a look at the graphs in the photo&lt;/strong&gt; I linked to in the beginning of the post, you&amp;#39;ll see me immediately begin to lose weight after November 31st (which was the date I finished P90X and then stopped eating the above and working out regularly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Equipment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to put a fair amount of money into this, as yet another reason to keep me sticking with things (if I&amp;#39;m going to spend over $1,000 on something, it&amp;#39;ll keep me motivated on days where said motivation might otherwise be lacking). I bought a Wyze scale, an adjustable weight bench, smoothie machine, 3 months worth of protein powder, BeachBody subscription, water bottle and two 71.5lb AtivaFit adjustable dumbells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How it Went&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, personally, I&amp;#39;m happy with the outcome. I only missed 4 days of the workout program, but otherwise stuck with it &amp;quot;as prescribed&amp;quot;. Some interesting and entirely unexpected things happened that I&amp;#39;m quite happy about. My skin looks a thousand times better...a few wrinkles have all but disappeared. I had a few areas of eczema on my leg and face as well, and they have &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; vanished (and they&amp;#39;ve plagued me for years...I purchase hydrocortisone cream once every month or so...and it&amp;#39;s literally gone without a trace now). To say &amp;quot;I feel a thousand times better&amp;quot; would be a massive understatement. My energy levels are through the roof, I sleep like a dead body, my relationship has benefited from it (wink wink)...it&amp;#39;s, well, amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What Next&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the roughly month I took off (and the weight I unintentionally lost during that time) I decided to give &amp;quot;Body Beast&amp;quot; a shot, now having more confidence that I wouldn&amp;#39;t injure myself almost immediately. I&amp;#39;d like to see if I can get to 180lbs and then cut some fat off...I&amp;#39;m noticing that while gaining muscle, my body fat percentage climbs right along with it so presumable if/when I can get to 180lbs, I&amp;#39;ll have a fair amount of fat to shave off at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

Squat 1RM: [https://imgur.com/a/w6Znd1o](https://imgur.com/a/w6Znd1o)

Like most people here I wanted to fit into my clothes better and was getting tired of people commenting on how skinny I was. For the past year I've been running a PPL routine that i've put together with some basic research with one rest day per week. I work out in the morning monday-friday and eat right after I get back from the gym. I am trying to find a new routine focused on powerbuilding as I love trying to push Squat, Bench, and Deadlift while continuing to focus on hypertrophy. I started out in my apartments gym and once I felt I needed more resistance after a month I signed up for a gym membership around mid February and then Covid shut down the gym until June. During that time I just focused on doing light cardio work 3-4 times a week.

Food wise i am rough tracking calories by eating a shake in the morning that is just over 1k calories and then 3-4 small meals throughout the day after that consist of a mix of chicken and past egg and tortilla rollups, salmon/veggie burgers and protein oat peanut butter mix throughout the day. When I've tracked calories it comes out to 2800-3000 calories per day. I am planning on cutting around April, but right now I don't mind the excess belly fat.

Shake Recipe every morning is below:

* 2 cups of milk
* half a frozen banana
* 1 scoop chocolate protein

Before:

* Bench 135
* Squat 185

Push day

* Flat Barbell Bench 5 set of 3-5 reps
* Incline Dumbell bench 4 sets 8-12 reps
* flat bench close grip bench 4 sets 8-12 reps
* Tricep push downs 4 sets 8-12 reps
* Cable flys 3 x8 low 3x8 high
* diamond pushups to failure 3 sets \*dips 3 sets to failure mix between chest and tricep focus

* Lat Pull down 4 sets 8-12
* bentover barbell rows
* preacher curls 4x8 or 21's x 3

,gainit,"Hey everyone, sorry if this post gets a little long. 

So basically, I've been working out for about 5 years now, and I don't look it. I'm a PT student so I have a lot of knowledge, good nutrition, consistency, etc. but one major roadblock throughout the entirety of my training has been form. 

I can recognize good/bad form in others, but I am horrible about it when it comes to myself. I can't see myself from all angles, so it's hard to focus on when I'm actually in the gym, but sometimes when the gym is empty I will set up my phone as a camera to check. 

I did that the other day as I hit some DLs, and upon review my back curved A LOT (this explains my recent back pain). Now I'm upset because all the progress I thought I made (finally hit a 1rm of &gt;300) was made with sloppy form. Back to 135 again, I guess. This has happened several times. 

I have decided to do nightly stretches and exercises to strengthen my hip flexors, but one thing has been bugging me. I want to bulk, because after all these years I'm still 185 lbs at ~16% bf. But I can't bulk with bad form...and I cant drop weights and expect to put on muscle either. So...

Do I drop the weight on key lifts for now, and go heavy on isolation exercises where my form is better? Do I drop weights, and get lean while I focus on form? Or do I maintain until I have my form perfected? I'm at an impasse and tired of spinning my wheels.

,gainit,"A couple of months ago I was 185 and I’m shocked to see that I’m currently 199 exactly (6’2). 

Because of life, there have been many days where I don’t even come close to my daily goal, but despite that I’m gaining at a good pace and I don’t really understand how or why.

On an ideal day I eat 3 meals and drink my shake that rounds out to about 990 calories with rarely any snacking throughout the day.

Mornings are usually 3-4 eggs, toast, with some variation of a side , then I make my shake which I drink throughout the next few hours. Lunch has typically been a double wrap burrito from chipotle at LEAST 3 times a week. It’s expensive but hopefully it’s paying off. Dinner is whatever my mom makes, which I appreciate since I’m busy with school. It’s honestly hard to keep track of my calories for things like homemade food not prepared by me, but I typically stuff myself with whatever food is there and hope for the best which you will probably flame me for, but it seems to be working so far. I also drink half a gallon of water throughout the day and that’s it.

As I’ve mentioned there are just days where I simply don’t get it done. It’s usually the weekends, where I have a time commitment from the very early morning to almost mid afternoon. I eat breakfast (Bacon Egg and Cheese + Coffee from Dunkin’) those days, and will probably eat a late lunch (Moes or Chipotle) after I’m done with my obligations. But by the time I get home on weekends (after legs on Saturday especially) I find myself having been too tired to go and make my shake/figure out dinner. I just shower and crash until the next day. Let’s assume I get 1600 calories on those weekend days from my two meals.

Sorry for rambling, but my main question revolves around whether or not the “calorie goal” is as strict as people make it seem. Is there supposed to be room for error? I figured when people stress the daily aspect, it’s for a reason.

On average I may have 4 great days of eating a week, one solid, and two where I know I didn’t eat enough. Despite that though, I’ve had gained steadily.

Hey y'all, back with a 2nd year update. 30 lbs gain in 2 years, def not all muscle but super happy about my progress. Recap: I've struggled with being under weight and having a myriad of GI issues for my entire adult life. I had never weighed above 130 lbs. Only recently have my eating habits felt ""normal"" and holy moly what have I been missing the past 15 years of my life. For the first time \*ever\* I finally feel ... right/normal. I can actually eat a full plate without feeling or needing to throw up. I have enough energy to make it through the day. I don't have to fight off dozing off during work or while driving. I'm not sure exactly what clicked after 28 years, but I know I started consistently working out 2 year ago and other aspects of my health and especially my GI issues started improving drastically.

DIET:

I don't follow a diet plan other then eating somewhat healthy and eating a complete breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. Again, being able to eat more then a bowl of cereal in a day without feeling full is a new experience for me so I honestly just try and eat as much as I can.

ROUTINE:

I \*had\* been hitting the gym 4 days a week generally doing a variation of PPL and little cardio, but since the pandemic I've been doing what I can in my garage ""gym"" - I have an adjustable dumbell set that's done a admirable job. I still get in 45 mins or exercise everyday and tend to stick to a ""at home"" variation of ppl

,gainit,"So I've just reached the 1 year progress point and thought I'd post on reddit which has been my main place for motivation and advice. I haven't made major progress but I'm happy with where I'm at.

I haven't been to the gym once since I started my fitness journey. At the start I just wanted to do some home workouts with dumbbells and build a foundation to then go to the gym, but then the pandemic came. Because of this I have never done any barbell lifts and I haven't attempted a pull up ever. I can't get a pull up bar as I am too afraid of damaging the door frames in my rented apartment.

# Before and After Pictures

1 Year progress, going from 155lbs to around 175lbs at the moment. Height is around 6'2"".

[https://imgur.com/a/H6seKZz](https://imgur.com/a/H6seKZz) \- **0,4,8,10,12 Month Progress**

# Training

I started out with a dumbbell full body workout that I found on Simeon Panda's YouTube that had some basic exercises that consisted of:

* **Pushups, Bent Over Rows, Bicep Curls, Tricep Kickbacks, Overhead Press, Squats, Stiff-Legged Deadlift, Leg Raises**

In the beginning I couldn't do one push up and used very light weights, doing 2 sets of 8-12 reps. After a month or two I started doing 3 sets. I would do this workout whenever I felt like it, sometimes everyday for a week and other times just once or twice a week.

After a few months of that I progressed into a PPL dumbbell split that I've been doing ever since. My dumbbells only go up to 45lbs so I can't do anything crazy.

Dumbbell PPL Routine:

Day 1 -

***Chest, Shoulders &amp; Triceps***

* **Pushups / Floor Press - 4 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Flys - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Overhead Press - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Dumbbell Side Raise - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Diamond Push Ups - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **Tricep Kickbacks / Skullcrushers - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**

Day 2 -

***Back &amp; Biceps***

* **Dumbbell Bent Over Row - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**
* **One Arm Dumbbell Row - 5 Sets, 8-12e. Reps**

* **Dumbbell Hammer Curl - 3 Sets, 8-12 Reps**

I do a version of that ab workout every day or two with some variations now and then. Admittedly I've skipped a lot of leg days, they are just not as enjoyable as the upper body days. Maybe once I get under the squat rack I'll enjoy them more.

Now I can do around 15-20 pushups in one set and feel much more comfortable doing them. I add weight to the dumbbells each week to try and make progress but it's hard since I only have a limited amount of weight to add.

# Diet

When I started working out I had just started learning how to cook so I was having 3 meals everyday and probably getting around 2500 calories in most days. I bought a mass gainer powder that I'd have 3 scoops of with 700-800ml of milk after a workout.

As for my diet right now, I try to get in 3000-4000 calories. I succeed most days but its not always the cleanest food. I usually get between 120-180g of protein. For breakfast I have 3 Weetabix with chocolate soya milk, a banana and a glass of fruit juice every morning, around 700kcal. My lunches vary. I was making a green smoothie with fruit juice, an avocado, spinach and peanut butter that was around 700kcal but it was too expensive so I've stopped making it. I'll usually have a sandwich and a couple clementine's or Baked beans on toast, lets say 500kcal. Dinner is usually around 800-900kcal, my go to meals are Tuna pasta, Chicken fried rice with chicken breast and 2 eggs, Beef burgers, Chicken breast with a sauce, rice and broccoli, etc. About 30 minutes to an hour after my dinner I'll have a protein smoothie that's around 700-800kcal. 400ml milk, 1 banana, 1 or 2 tbsp. of peanut butter, 1tsp. Nutella, 1 scoop whey protein. Around 10 or 11pm I'll have something else to eat, usually another sandwich or a couple pb&amp;j sandwiches. That's about all I eat + some other snacks and unhealthy foods in-between. I'm going to start having a glass of whole milk with my lunch and later meal to get some more calories in. I definitely have more space to eat as I have a big appetite it's just I don't really enjoy eating and don't know what to eat without being super unhealthy.

I don't take any supplements or creatine, except protein powder.

Hopefully the world returns to normal soon and I can make some real gains in the gym. I'm pleased with the progress I've made though and hope to continue gaining weight this year.

Advice and tips on what I could change and improve on are appreciated. Also feel free to post your favorite meals for lunch and dinner to give me some more ideas on what to have.

**YOU MUST DO CARDIO.**

Cardio &amp; Conditioning Work is not optional, and it's not a suggestion. It's a MUST-DO. This is a non-negotiable.

- ""But I'm only trying to build muscle, I have no interest in building endurance""...

- ""I'm already a hard-gainer as it is. I don't want to burn the additional calories""...

- ""I just don't have time to do cardio, it's boring; I mean really, really boring"" etc.

Have you ever said any of these things? These are the most common excuses for skipping cardio &amp; conditioning.

Never mind the manifold health benefits for cardio. Never mind the fact it can help boost appetite significantly. 

Let's look at this instead through the lens of this metaphor: YOUR BODY IS AN ENGINE. (Well, *you* are the *vehicle,* and your muscles are the engine, rather). You are much like a finely-tuned machine that creates movement and work. And how does a motor accomplish this? It's the pistons firing up &amp; down that drive the transmission, which translates into rotation of the wheels. We all understand that the force of the internal combustion engine is what moves the car or truck along. Are you with me so far?

Well, how would you build a stronger engine, an engine with more torque or more horsepower? The fastest route is through a simple increase in DISPLACEMENT. (I say ""simple"", but it's anything but that. It requires a great deal of machining to do this. Honestly, it would be faster to just swap out engines altogether. But I digress). So what would that look like? You would bore out each of the cylinders to a larger diameter, and swap out the pistons with larger ones. In a nutshell, you would increase the total cubic inches of volume wherein the combustion happens. Does that make sense?

*More displacement equals more fuel/air mixture equals bigger boom equals more force.*

In a limited sense, this would be a way to achieve ""engine hypertrophy"". You make a bigger engine.

But in practice, can you do (only) this? Can you simply make your internal combustion chamber larger and have it work?

**NO.** No it's not enough to have a larger engine block. And why is this? Because there's a host of other mechanical mechanisms that also need to be in place to support an increase in displacement. You would also want to re-machine the valve openings and install larger valves (to let fuel in, and let exhaust out more rapidly). The engine would also require larger diameter intake &amp; exhaust manifolds. It would also likely require a higher-flow fuel pump. It would also overheat easier, which would necessitate a more robust cooling system (higher pressure &amp; higher volume of engine coolant) etc.

All these requirements are based on the fact that a larger combustion process requires more air to match the increase in gasoline which fuels the process. A larger engine also results in a higher volume of exhaust gases after the explosion. The combustion of a larger engine runs hotter, which means the cooling requirements are greater. The whole point of this allegory is YOU CAN'T SIMPLY MAKE A LARGER ENGINE. All the supporting systems will need to be upgraded too.

Again, this is just a metaphor. But the thrust of my post is thus: *If you build bigger muscles through lifting, you're also going to need to upgrade your supporting physiological processes!* So stop thinking of ""cardio"" as for ""endurance"" only. Instead, envision cardio as HELPING YOUR MUSCLES **BREATHE.** Your ability to lift a meaningful volume of challenging sets within a reasonable time depends on your muscles ability to get adequate fuel, to dispose of metabolic wastes efficiently, and to oxygenate all of the tissues that are involved in performing the lift itself.

Is resistance-training enough to improve your resistance training? No, it's not. Lifting in &amp; of itself doesn't burn a ton of calories, and it doesn't really ramp up mitochondrial activity. Supplemental cardio &amp; conditioning work will increase your total energy in the gym. It will make higher-rep sets easier to hit. It will help you be ready for the next set sooner. It will reduce muscle soreness in the days following each session. It will help get glycogen &amp; nutrients back into the muscle and tendon, to repair them faster and more efficiently. It will increase insulin sensitivity significantly etc. etc.

If you're bulking in a massing phase, you should be doing even *more* cardio than when you're cutting!

If you want to minimize fat accumulation on a bulk, you need to be doing more cardio &amp; conditioning!

If you're having difficulty recovering, but you're eating &amp; sleeping enough, you likely need more cardio!

Cardio/Conditioning can be as simple as adding a couple of brisk walks every single day. Two 10-minute walks are quick, easy, require no special equipment, and can be done right outside your front door. You don't need to suit up, drive to the gym, and sweat out on a stairclimber for an hour (unless you enjoy that!). Simply add brisk walks a couple times per day, every day. If you ever feel drowsy after a big meal, go for a walk. It tends to energize you, and pick you right back up.

Another favorite of mine is skipping rope. For a small investment ($12-15 bucks), you can get a jump rope and skip for 5-10 minutes per day (this is in addition to the brisk walking). I like intervals (skip for 20 seconds, pause for 10 seconds, repeat). Or shoot for a total number (100 skips, 500 skips, whatever). Just get better at it, and build up volume over time. A little bit every day, every other day, adds nothing to your allostatic load. It's not really fatiguing whatsoever.

What else can be done with little/no equipment? HILL SPRINTS. (Find a hill, run up it, walk back down, sprint back up. Repeat a few times). The goal with the heavier conditioning like this is to get winded; you *want* to get out of breathe, and continue to keep pushing into it. If you have a backpack, you can fill it with books and/or a couple dumbbells, and walk with that for distance, hopefully uphill! Wrap those weights in a blanket or pillow, and walk for 30-45 minutes. A canvas bag can also be purchased for little cost, and filled with sandbags. This can be used for front carries etc.

Look, I know cardio is additional work. But if you want to make the most of a bulking phase, ADD CARDIO.

Just move more every day, and make a point of getting winded/gassed/totally-out-of-breath a couple times per week.

Your total energy will go up, your focus &amp; attention will improve, your gym aggression and recovery will increase.

There's like 20 different reasons to add cardio/conditioning work, but I can't think of a single reason NOT to.

,gainit,"I’m 21M and last I checked 80kg 189cm.

I am pretty skinny, almost skinny fat tho I’d say. I stumbled upon this subreddit after wanting to bulk up and gain muscle mass for a long while. And finally thought I would something about it.

MFP recommended about 3000 calories but all the TDEE calculators have recommended about 3500ish so I went with that. I normally eat large portions anyway so it’s not that much of an issue to eat more tbh. I am planning to workout 5 days a week following a dumbbell only workout plan (Link:[Workout Plan](https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/workouts/dumbbellworkout5day_0.pdf)

And this is what I’ve been eating this week:

I wake up at 5 and do my workout/attempted yoga and meditation for my mind. Finish somewhere around 6:30 for the lot.

Then I have my breakfast at about 8ish after getting to work:

Berroca + 1 pint/1L of water.
60g mornflake oats
Crave dale full fat milk 250ml
1 tbsp peanut butter KP
1 tsp honey
1 black coffee
Multivitamin

Then at about 12-1ish I have lunch.

This week it’s been:
100g basmati white rice
25g baked oven crisps
1 Pepsi max 
1 wagon wheel
1 tbsp Nando’s Perinase 
50-100gram tenderstem broccoli 
100g green beans
350g chicken breast

Dinner varies as other people in my family eat differently but an example meal would be:

4 Thick pork sausages
100g peas 
400g mash
150ml gravy

Snacks
50g Bombay mix
1 apple 
1 banana 

I’m have about 3L water a day (hopefully)


What do you guys think this day in particular macro wise was 

2869 calories 
175g Protein
98g fat
(35g saturated fats)
309g carbs

I am planning buying the extreme gainer protein powder from my protein as I get 50% off and it looks decent. And having that after workouts with oats peanut butter honey and full fat milk.

&lt;p&gt;I am pretty skinny, almost skinny fat tho I’d say. I stumbled upon this subreddit after wanting to bulk up and gain muscle mass for a long while. And finally thought I would something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MFP recommended about 3000 calories but all the TDEE calculators have recommended about 3500ish so I went with that. I normally eat large portions anyway so it’s not that much of an issue to eat more tbh. I am planning to workout 5 days a week following a dumbbell only workout plan (Link:&lt;a href=""https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/workouts/dumbbellworkout5day_0.pdf""&gt;Workout Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what I’ve been eating this week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up at 5 and do my workout/attempted yoga and meditation for my mind. Finish somewhere around 6:30 for the lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I have my breakfast at about 8ish after getting to work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berroca + 1 pint/1L of water.
60g mornflake oats
Crave dale full fat milk 250ml
1 tbsp peanut butter KP
1 tsp honey
1 black coffee
Multivitamin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then at about 12-1ish I have lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week it’s been:
100g basmati white rice
25g baked oven crisps
1 Pepsi max 
1 wagon wheel
1 tbsp Nando’s Perinase 
50-100gram tenderstem broccoli 
100g green beans
350g chicken breast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner varies as other people in my family eat differently but an example meal would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Thick pork sausages

,gainit,"Hello,

I (18M 5’10.5” 148lb) have been currently trying to bulk since mid-late December. My routine is usually as follows:

Monday: Pull day

Tuesday: HIIT workout

Wednesday : Leg day

Thursday: Running if possible

Friday: Push day

Saturday: HIIT workout 

Sunday: Indoor cycle if possible 

(On my running days, I do interval sprints for 45 minutes-1 hour or so. On cycle days, it’s about the same. On HIIT workouts, it’s usually a 35 or 40 minute workout from Fitness Blender.)

My main question is: am I doing too much cardio that ruins my muscle growth? I go as hard as possible on lifting days, so that’s not a problem. However, (especially with running), I feel that I do too much cardio and it’s ruining my gains. I also try to eat more calories than I burn and usually eat chicken, pasta, steak, fish, and other high-protein foods in my meals, as well as a protein bar, frozen fruit protein shake, a banana, a mandarin, and a spinach salad with eggs, bacon, and eggs everyday.

Since August 2019, my 5 rep exercises have gone from:

1 set, 5 reps:
Deadlift: 150lbs, 305lbs

Everything else is 5x5:

Squat: 135lbs, 270lbs

Bench press: 95lbs, 165 lbs

Overhead press: 55lbs, 115lbs

Barbell row: 85lbs, 165lbs

Keep in mind these second numbers are just what I’m currently progressing through on PPL (through the Clank app), not like an official max or anything. 

I just don’t know where to go from here. I want to be, you know, jacked, but don’t know if I get there through bulking (I’ve pretty much been on a bulk since I started), or cutting then bulking again. I included pics where I’m flexing but also just passive to show how far my stomach can extend. I’m 180lbs, 5’8”, 18 y/o. From the front, my arms seem kind of lacking but then in other pictures they look okay. Don’t really know where to go to get where I wanna be, through switching programs, cutting or bulking, etc. Been eating 3500 cals almost everyday, definitely getting enough protein.

Perhaps you guys can help me a little bit of a dilemma I've been having. This indecisiveness has been bugging me for the last couple of months.

&amp;#x200B;

27M, 175 cm, 73-75kg, Natural (for now?)

I've been lifting seriously and consistently for almost 5 years, mainly focused on hypertrophy. In this time I have put on some weight (+10-12kgs) and I am quite content with the results. 

My routine is usually Chest/Back/Legs/Shoulders/Arms , and sometimes I switch to something more similar to PPL. I try to choose weights that allow me to get to 10-12 reps before failure, I might throw in some supersets and dropsets here and there. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've been wanting to take up boxing (or maybe muay thai/mma) and I've been struggling to figure out how to make it fit with my current weightlifting routine without sacrificing too much on that front. 

I understand some sacrifice needs to be done, but I don't even know where to begin, and how to adapt my current weightlifting routine to fit with this new high-intensity gain-killing activity I want to take up. AND how to do it without getting injured !!

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I would be able to maintain my current muscle mass without improvement in size, and make significant improvement in Boxing / MMA. Is this a realistic goal? Or am I being too optimistic?

,gainit,"Greetings Once Again Gainers,

Like many of you gainers, I work an office job in front of a computer at a desk that has minimal physical demand and lots of sitting.  This allows for unique opportunities for gaining, IF one is willing to take a few unique actions in order to maximize the potential contained within.  I wanted to share some tips I’ve picked up along the way so that you can make the most of your situation.  This should work for those of you that are stuck in an office OR for those of you that are full time students, but even those of you with less sedentary lifestyles may be able to pick something up from it.

---

**THINGS TO BUY** 

* INSULATED LUNCHBOX.  Having a way to bring food to the office is key to ensuring you have food to eat.  You don’t want to eat out for every meal, as it’s costly and you have minimal control over food quality.  You also run the risk of losing your parking space if you leave for lunch.  AND, if you bring food, you don’t run the risk of working through lunch, which is typical for you workaholics.  My wife bought me [this one]( https://www.amazon.com/Performa-Punisher-MealPrep-Bag-Accommodate/dp/B077GRQFQN/ref=sr_1_35?dchild=1&amp;keywords=punisher+insulated+lunch+box&amp;qid=1611162229&amp;sr=8-35) for my birthday, and it’s really awesome, but you can get something simple.  The other benefit of having your own lunchbox is you can keep your food in it and next to you vs using the office communal fridge, which prevents food thieves from eating your lunch and leaving you hungry.  And, of course, I keep writing “lunch”, but in truth, I pack a LOT of food for work.  I literally eat something every hour that I’m at work, and that lunchbox goes a long way to ensure that I have enough food to get me through my shift.

* STAINLESS STEEL WATER BOTTLE.  I like a [half gallon size]( https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Bottle-AOZEX-Insulated-Leakproof/dp/B085S6M2TR/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3QOFYWV32ZGIW&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=stainless+steel+half+gallon+water+bottle&amp;qid=1611162464&amp;sprefix=stainless+steel+half+gall%2Caps%2C179&amp;sr=8-8) like that one.  If you’re gaining, you’re eating a lot of protein.  Protein, as a macronutrient, requires more water for digestion than any other macronutrient.  It’s why most “survival food” has minimal protein in it and much more fats and carbs.  But you don’t run the risk of dying of dehydration in an office IF you’re keeping hydrated.  The other perk about drinking a lot of water while working is that it will force you to get up more frequently so that you can go use the bathroom, which can prevent the maladies associated with remaining in a seated position for so long.  I aim to fill and drink this 3 times in a shift, getting in 6 liters of water a day.  Oh yeah, and steel tends to have less toxins associated with it compared to drinking from plastic bottles, and this is environmentally friendly compared to junking a bunch of single use plastic bottles, so that’s cool too.

* GLASS FOOD CONTAINERS. [This]( https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Storage-Containers-Piece-Proof/dp/B082SN4QH6/ref=sr_1_4?crid=X03R665LMPQ6&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=glass+storage+containers&amp;qid=1611162677&amp;sprefix=glass%2Caps%2C196&amp;sr=8-4) is the set I have, but there are a ton out there.  That lunchbox I linked came with containers, and I still use them for veggies and sandwiches, but when it comes to food that needs reheating or has sauces/staining elements to it, glass is the way to go. Zapping plastic in the microwave never sits well with me, and if you put something with pasta sauce in a plastic container the stain never gets out.  I also find that food tends to stay fresher in glass containers, which is great if you make things in bulk and eat them throughout the week.  I’ve had leftover last MUCH longer once I switched from tupperwear to glass containers. 

* GRIPPERS.  [Captains of Crush are King]( https://www.amazon.com/IronMind-Captains-Crush-Hand-Gripper/dp/B0094WEFJM/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=captains+of+crush+grippers&amp;qid=1611165376&amp;sr=8-4), but I have heard good things about heavy grippers as well.  These are great toys to have at the office whenever you have some downtime and wanna get in some sort of training.  People tend to neglect their grip a lot in their training, and these dudes will right fix that.  Make no mistake: these aren’t sporting goods store grippers that you’re going to mindlessly click for a million reps: this is a real workout.  

* PLASTIC OR BAMBOO SILVERARE.  If you’re fortunate enough to have your own desk, make sure it has a lot of ready to go silverware in it.  Nothing is worse than packing a whole bunch of food for work and then finding out you have no way of eating it because you forgot to pack THAT.  Consequently, I picked up some [bamboo silverware]( https://www.amazon.com/Bamboo-Utensils-Cutlery-Set-BEWBOW/dp/B07MGVXFWJ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&amp;keywords=bamboo+silverware&amp;qid=1611162990&amp;sr=8-9) that is attached to my lunchbox now so that I know I’ll never be without.  Also great when there are surprise office birthdays, because people always remember the cake and always forget the forks.

* SLOW COOKER/INSTANT POT.  I’ve written about all this already in my post on [bachelor bulking]( https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ijjm9h/bachelor_bulking_quit_making_shakes_learn_how_to/), but seriously, get some sort of way to make a lot of food with little effort, put it in the BIG glass container, then transition it to the little glass containers and put that in your lunchbox for the day.

**THINGS TO DO** (workouts before work, full sessions, conditioning sessions, tabata)
* WORKOUT BEFORE WORK.  One of the best things you, as a gainer, can do is to workout BEFORE you get to work.  Why?  Because training makes you hungry, and if you’re struggling to gain, increasing appetite before you get to work is a GOOD thing.  Sure, it also helps make you awake and is good for health and all that, but we’re talking about gaining here.  You can either do a full on lifting workout, a 10-20 minute conditioning workout, OR you could even do a simple short Tabata style workout.

If you’re unfamiliar with what Tabata is: [here]( https://www.t-nation.com/training/tabata-method) is a great article on it by Dan John.  Yeah, it talks about fat loss, but since we’re using it to TRIGGER appetite and THEN eat, it works well for our purposes.  Burpees are a great movement to use this on, as they require no equipment and you can knock it out stupidly quick.  If you have MORE than 4 minutes, look for some Crossfit WODs or just do a simple circuit workout.  You could do something like 5 burpees-10 push ups-20 squats for as many rounds as possible in 10-20 minutes.  Either way, get in the training BEFORE work and then spend the entire time you’re there eating out of that lunch box.  And speaking of eating…

*OFFICE DRONE SNACKS**
These are the foods you should have at your desk, ready to go at a moment’s notice to get your gain on.

* PROTEIN BARS.  I’m a big fan of [Quest](https://www.questnutrition.com/collections/protein-bars), but there are tons of great brands out there.  Costco sells a knock off of Quest that is quite good and cheap, and I buy a lot of those as well.  These are perfect to keep at the desk or in a backpack/pocket for when you need to get on a protein fix.

* NUTS.  I’m not going to link you to nuts: you can figure that out.  But nuts have just TONS of positive qualities associated with them due to their healtful fats, and they are very calorie dense.  Have a jar at your desk.

* DRIED FRUIT.  Raisins, prunes, dates, figs, whatever.  These things don’t spoil and are packed with calories, along with nutrients.  Another fantastic snack.

* NUT BUTTERS.  Peanut butter, almond, cashew, etc.  This, combined with your plastic or bamboo spoon, is absolute money for a quick and easy snack.  I’m actually really into the brand [Nuts N More]( https://nuts-n-more.com/collections/online-store), which is a peanut/almond butter mixed with a protein powder for a slightly better macro breakdown, but as long as you stick with the natural stuff that requires stirring you should be just fine.

* INSTANT OATMEAL.  I like [this brand]( https://www.betteroats.com/), because it coming with it’s own measuring pouch is pretty cool, but again, there are a lot of choices out there.  Instant oatmeal is a real treat on a cold day, and you can use your office microwave or coffee maker to get some hot water to make this quick. 

* POP TARTS.  Man I love pop tarts.  That said, you probably shouldn’t eat them.  …but man I love pop tarts.

It’s why most “survival food” has minimal protein in it and much more fats and carbs.  But you don’t run the risk of dying of dehydration in an office IF you’re keeping hydrated.  The other perk about drinking a lot of water while working is that it will force you to get up more frequently so that you can go use the bathroom, which can prevent the maladies associated with remaining in a seated position for so long.  I aim to fill and drink this 3 times in a shift, getting in 6 liters of water a day.  Oh yeah, and steel tends to have less toxins associated with it compared to drinking from plastic bottles, and this is environmentally friendly compared to junking a bunch of single use plastic bottles, so that’s cool too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLASS FOOD CONTAINERS. &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Glass-Storage-Containers-Piece-Proof/dp/B082SN4QH6/ref=sr_1_4?crid=X03R665LMPQ6&amp;amp;dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=glass+storage+containers&amp;amp;qid=1611162677&amp;amp;sprefix=glass%2Caps%2C196&amp;amp;sr=8-4""&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the set I have, but there are a ton out there.  That lunchbox I linked came with containers, and I still use them for veggies and sandwiches, but when it comes to food that needs reheating or has sauces/staining elements to it, glass is the way to go. Zapping plastic in the microwave never sits well with me, and if you put something with pasta sauce in a plastic container the stain never gets out.  I also find that food tends to stay fresher in glass containers, which is great if you make things in bulk and eat them throughout the week.  I’ve had leftover last MUCH longer once I switched from tupperwear to glass containers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRIPPERS.  &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/IronMind-Captains-Crush-Hand-Gripper/dp/B0094WEFJM/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=captains+of+crush+grippers&amp;amp;qid=1611165376&amp;amp;sr=8-4""&gt;Captains of Crush are King&lt;/a&gt;, but I have heard good things about heavy grippers as well.  These are great toys to have at the office whenever you have some downtime and wanna get in some sort of training.  People tend to neglect their grip a lot in their training, and these dudes will right fix that.  Make no mistake: these aren’t sporting goods store grippers that you’re going to mindlessly click for a million reps: this is a real workout.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLASTIC OR BAMBOO SILVERARE.  If you’re fortunate enough to have your own desk, make sure it has a lot of ready to go silverware in it.  Nothing is worse than packing a whole bunch of food for work and then finding out you have no way of eating it because you forgot to pack THAT.  Consequently, I picked up some &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Bamboo-Utensils-Cutlery-Set-BEWBOW/dp/B07MGVXFWJ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=bamboo+silverware&amp;amp;qid=1611162990&amp;amp;sr=8-9""&gt;bamboo silverware&lt;/a&gt; that is attached to my lunchbox now so that I know I’ll never be without.  Also great when there are surprise office birthdays, because people always remember the cake and always forget the forks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLOW COOKER/INSTANT POT.  I’ve written about all this already in my post on &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ijjm9h/bachelor_bulking_quit_making_shakes_learn_how_to/""&gt;bachelor bulking&lt;/a&gt;, but seriously, get some sort of way to make a lot of food with little effort, put it in the BIG glass container, then transition it to the little glass containers and put that in your lunchbox for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THINGS TO DO&lt;/strong&gt; (workouts before work, full sessions, conditioning sessions, tabata)
* WORKOUT BEFORE WORK.  One of the best things you, as a gainer, can do is to workout BEFORE you get to work.  Why?  Because training makes you hungry, and if you’re struggling to gain, increasing appetite before you get to work is a GOOD thing.  Sure, it also helps make you awake and is good for health and all that, but we’re talking about gaining here.  You can either do a full on lifting workout, a 10-20 minute conditioning workout, OR you could even do a simple short Tabata style workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with what Tabata is: &lt;a href=""https://www.t-nation.com/training/tabata-method""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a great article on it by Dan John.  Yeah, it talks about fat loss, but since we’re using it to TRIGGER appetite and THEN eat, it works well for our purposes.  Burpees are a great movement to use this on, as they require no equipment and you can knock it out stupidly quick.  If you have MORE than 4 minutes, look for some Crossfit WODs or just do a simple circuit workout.  You could do something like 5 burpees-10 push ups-20 squats for as many rounds as possible in 10-20 minutes.  Either way, get in the training BEFORE work and then spend the entire time you’re there eating out of that lunch box.  And speaking of eating…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OFFICE DRONE SNACKS&lt;/em&gt;*
These are the foods you should have at your desk, ready to go at a moment’s notice to get your gain on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROTEIN BARS.  I’m a big fan of &lt;a href=""https://www.questnutrition.com/collections/protein-bars""&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt;, but there are tons of great brands out there.  Costco sells a knock off of Quest that is quite good and cheap, and I buy a lot of those as well.  These are perfect to keep at the desk or in a backpack/pocket for when you need to get on a protein fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NUTS.  I’m not going to link you to nuts: you can figure that out.  But nuts have just TONS of positive qualities associated with them due to their healtful fats, and they are very calorie dense.  Have a jar at your desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DRIED FRUIT.  Raisins, prunes, dates, figs, whatever.  These things don’t spoil and are packed with calories, along with nutrients.  Another fantastic snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NUT BUTTERS.  Peanut butter, almond, cashew, etc.  This, combined with your plastic or bamboo spoon, is absolute money for a quick and easy snack.  I’m actually really into the brand &lt;a href=""https://nuts-n-more.com/collections/online-store""&gt;Nuts N More&lt;/a&gt;, which is a peanut/almond butter mixed with a protein powder for a slightly better macro breakdown, but as long as you stick with the natural stuff that requires stirring you should be just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSTANT OATMEAL.  I like &lt;a href=""https://www.betteroats.com/""&gt;this brand&lt;/a&gt;, because it coming with it’s own measuring pouch is pretty cool, but again, there are a lot of choices out there.  Instant oatmeal is a real treat on a cold day, and you can use your office microwave or coffee maker to get some hot water to make this quick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;POP TARTS.  Man I love pop tarts.  That said, you probably shouldn’t eat them.  …but man I love pop tarts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing earth shattering here, of course, but hopefully some of the information contained within here can help you office drones make the most of your gaining experience.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hi all,

So im currently a noob lifter and have been working out on a 4 day split,

- Monday and Thursday
 - flat barbell press 4 x 10
 - deadlifts 5 x 10
 - Overhead press 5 x 10
 - Incline dumbell press 4 x 10
 - dips 4 or 5 x 5 to 10


Tuesday and Friday
 - pull ups or Lat pull down 5 x 10
 - Squats 5 x 10
 - Dumbell seated rows 5 x 10
 - Seated reverse fly 5 x 10
 - Bicep Curl 5 x 10

So this is my 4 day plan... I keep track of my weight and keep them at a range of around 1 maybe 2 from failure. 

The biggest issue I have is that unless i take long breaks by the time I reach the 5th exercise Im pretty rooted and have been finidng that the exercise is super lack luster... 

Last few weeks Ive been cutting the 5th out all together as im pretty flat. 

Im wondering if this is because im new? Starting lifting with my brother (not super structured around 6 months ago) And my body will adjust as I do it more? 

My weekly sets arent crazy high for anything, chest is top with 16 total but that's within the 10 to 20 range i keep hearing.

I posted in thr r/loseit sub and the response i got was to check sleep and diet.

Sleep i aim for 8 hours but get closer to 7. (Rogan and Mathew walker set me on a straight and narrow path on that)

I’ve lurked this subreddit for years and up until about two and a half years ago, I honestly never thought I could bring myself to finally get up to a healthy weight. 

I’m gonna preface this by saying I’ve struggled with body dysmorphia a lot in the past, partly due to my autism and partly due to being called skinny my entire life. HOWEVER, I’ve been relentlessly working on my self-respect and my mental health in general, so it’s leveled out a lot for me.

I should also say, this isn’t a super dramatic transformation and I’m well aware. As I’ll talk about later, I honestly didn’t even set out with gaining weight as a goal until recently, so most of this is just the consequence of living better, not getting fucked up all the time, and eating (a little) better. YMMV. Anyway-

As with so many of you guys, I thought the whole time that it was just my metabolism, and that things would never get better. Well today, I got a memory on my phone of an old shirtless picture. I swear to god y’all my jaw almost hit the floor. I didn’t remember being THAT skinny. So I took another picture of myself today to compare, and that really helped me check my dysmorphia. I have so much trouble actually understanding how I look to other people, but when I saw the pictures back to back it just hit me like a ton of bricks how much healthier I am these days. 

If I’m being real, I didn’t do much to change my weight (at least from a training standpoint). I started doing calisthenics about a year ago and before that I took a job doing electrical work. I’ve also been incredibly lucky to find a partner that loves cooking and eating healthy, and she’s been really helping teach me better habits on that end. After seeing those pictures side by side though, I’ve decided to go all in. I want to feel my best and be as healthy as I possibly can be.

Waist: ~25 to 28.5""

My wrist and ankle circumference are 6"" and 7.5"" respectively.

#2.1. Training  (part 1 June 2019 - August 2020)

So when I first started working out, I didn't know anything about how to exercise. At the very beginning I couldn't even do a normal push up I was so weak. I didn't even know pull ups were a thing or the fact you had to actually train your back. I didn't start working to get jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. And the only exercises I knew were push ups, sit ups and squats. I didn't have any equipments, neither did I have time or money to go to a gym. I first started with an app called 30 Day Home Workout Challenge or something like that. It had different variations of push ups and sit ups. It took me about 3 months to build up to 10 normal push ups. During this time I was watching a lot of YouTube videos about bodyweight workouts and fitness in general. I didn't have a pull up bar. So I did my pull ups first on a door ledge and then on a collapsible gate with towels wrapped around it otherwise my hands would bleed. The first time I did negative pull ups, after mere 3 reps I had incredible pain in my elbows that lasted almost a whole week. I could neither fully straighten or bend my arms. However I kept going and slowly, very slowly got better until I could do it for some reps without pain.

I had also stopped using that app and was trying things myself. However I didn't know what I was doing. I thought I knew everything from watching YouTube videos but clearly that was not the case. I was following AthleanX and was doing 17 different curl variations with my 25lbs red resistance tube. Most of my exercises were of the same intensity (didn't change the progressions to make it harder) and I always did everything to failure. Was trying out different things like density training, drop set everything, mechanical drop set everything and what not. I was the perfect example of doing fuckaroundities.

Around last year March it slowly occurred to me that I was not moving forward. There was no progress. In fact, I made all the progress in the first 5-6 months and for almost a year I didn't make any progress. Neither strength not physique wise.

I was now following a workout app called Calisthenics. It's not too bad except it used ridiculously high volume and hardly any change in intensity. I was exhausted after each session, but no substantial progress was made... (to be continued)

● Strength level during this period - 10-12 pull ups, 25 push ups, 12 dips (all max)

#2.2. Training (part 2 August 2020 - Now)

I was becoming suspicious of what I was doing and the advice I was getting. During this time (May-June 2020) I read the book Power to the People by Pavel Insulin and it almost completely changed the way I looked at exercising. It was something very new and interesting. I started getting more and more curious about the concept of strength training; started reading more about it on the internet, frequently visiting Powerlifting related forums and getting more knowledge about bodyweight training. Then I got the book ""Science and Practice of Strength Training"" by Vladimir Zatsiorsky and ""Building the Gymnatics Body"" by Christopher Sommer.  And it changed everything. 

I started building and following my own routine and made huge changes to my training (this is around August-September). The major changes was making the rep range 3-5, upping the intensity, taking more rest time, reducing the number of exercises and focusing compound movements while applying the concept of progressive overload. And my strength increased rapidly!

It's important to know that all this while I was training at home at around 3am (then I used to sleep at daytime and stayed up all night). And for equipment I only had a light red resistance band. I used the kitchen counter to do dips and used an old backpack + some bricks for extra weight in pull ups and dips. In June I bought a pair of gymnastics rings which I hung from the gate. And in late October I started going to the park very early morning (5am) worked out there. I also bought a heavy band (50-70lbs) this November.

● Current strength level - max weighted pull ups is approx 25kg (with a brick between my legs), max weighted dip would be around 30kg (I can do about 4-5 reps with the same brick mentioned above). Chest to Wall Handstand Push Up 5 reps (still can't balance a handstand). 3-4 one arm push ups on each arm (clean form). I can hold a straddle front lever for 5-6 seconds but I'm not training Front Lever anymore so that I can fully focus on one arm chin up training. For one arm chin up I can do band assisted (same light band) OAC with 1 finger distance from the ring and where I hold the band. For back lever (supinated) I can hold about 10s of advance tuck open hips, I feel like I'm almost ready for straddle. I'm also training for bent arm planche on Rings where I'm at around 12-15s with advance tuck open hip position. I'm working on my handstand but still can't balance it. I can hold an L Sit on the floor for 20s. Max bodyweight pull is 15-16. I can also do about 5-6 full Dragon Flag however I never trained for it.

#3. Routine

I follow a template, not a fixed routine as exercises keep changing as I move up the progression ladder. It looks somewhat like this -

Day 1. 

A. OAC Progression 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B1. Back Lever 3-4 sets of 3-5/5s-15s superset with 
B2. 10 Reverse Hyperextension (3 min rest)

C1. Weighted pull up 3 sets of 6-8 (2 min rest)
False Grip Hang 3 sets of max hold superset with 
C2. Bicep curls with that ~25kg brick to failure (1m 30s rest)

Day 2. 

A. The hardest pushing exercise that I can do (right now it is RTO Dips with Rings 90° turned out through out the whole movement) 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)

B. Elevated Dominik Sky style pike push up 4 sets of 5-8 (3 min rest)

C. Bent Arm Planche progression on Rings 3 sets of 10s-20s (2 min rest)

D. Weighted Dip + heavy band 3 sets of 5-8 (2 min rest)

E. Bodyweight Triceps Extension 3 sets of 10-12 (1m 30s rest)

Then repeat day 1...

Along with these I also train handstand for 20-30 min a day and flexibility + mobility for an hour but different time of the day. Everything combined it takes me about 3 hours a day for a full training.

#4. Nutrition

For hypertrophy or weight gain (and loss) diet is one of the most important factors. However I'm helpless in this situation. I can't afford enough food to get big. I eat what is cooked in home. I don't track my macros or calories. I eat rice twice a day (as lunch and dinner) with curries, a glass of milk, I'm not a vegetarian but I rarely eat meat because it's expensive, I also don't eat fish because it tastes very bad, I eat 1 banana before training right after waking up, 2 eggs, loads of potato and for breakfast or snacks in the evening I eat bread with peanut butter. I also drink sattu which contains a good amount of soy protein (about 20g in 100g/2 glass). I have only gained about 10lbs this year which speaks volume about my diet however there is nothing I can do about that.

#6. About me

If you are still reading this (wow lol) and if you are curious about how I got into that low weight in the first place, here's a brief history of me. When I was 9 months old I had a deseas called Steven Johnson's Syndrome (Toxic Epidermal Nacrolysis stage). It's a very rare (like one in a million in US) and severe deseas (Google for more info). I didn't die but I had permanent damage to my eyes. I'm visually impaired, have photophobia/light sensitivity (that's why I used to sleep at daytime) and dry eyes. I was in a blind boys hostel from the age of 6-12 where I didn't eat enough. My weight was very low. I used to poop like once in 2 weeks. Not to mention I incredibly weak I was. My parents got separated when I was like 10 and I stayed with my mom. I started working out not to be jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. 

And I'm totally aware of the fact that my progress is very slow, objectly it's very bad. I'm almost 2 years into it what do I have to show for it, freaking elbow lever? I can't even do a handstand or a muscle up which is nothing short of embarrassment at this point. I want to be very good at what I do, and clearly I'm showing no signs to indicate that. If I keep training hopefully this year will be better and I may have something better to show for next January.

Waist: ~25 to 28.5&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wrist and ankle circumference are 6&amp;quot; and 7.5&amp;quot; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2.1. Training  (part 1 June 2019 - August 2020)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I first started working out, I didn&amp;#39;t know anything about how to exercise. At the very beginning I couldn&amp;#39;t even do a normal push up I was so weak. I didn&amp;#39;t even know pull ups were a thing or the fact you had to actually train your back. I didn&amp;#39;t start working to get jacked or anything, I just wanted to look normal. And the only exercises I knew were push ups, sit ups and squats. I didn&amp;#39;t have any equipments, neither did I have time or money to go to a gym. I first started with an app called 30 Day Home Workout Challenge or something like that. It had different variations of push ups and sit ups. It took me about 3 months to build up to 10 normal push ups. During this time I was watching a lot of YouTube videos about bodyweight workouts and fitness in general. I didn&amp;#39;t have a pull up bar. So I did my pull ups first on a door ledge and then on a collapsible gate with towels wrapped around it otherwise my hands would bleed. The first time I did negative pull ups, after mere 3 reps I had incredible pain in my elbows that lasted almost a whole week. I could neither fully straighten or bend my arms. However I kept going and slowly, very slowly got better until I could do it for some reps without pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had also stopped using that app and was trying things myself. However I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was doing. I thought I knew everything from watching YouTube videos but clearly that was not the case. I was following AthleanX and was doing 17 different curl variations with my 25lbs red resistance tube. Most of my exercises were of the same intensity (didn&amp;#39;t change the progressions to make it harder) and I always did everything to failure. Was trying out different things like density training, drop set everything, mechanical drop set everything and what not. I was the perfect example of doing fuckaroundities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around last year March it slowly occurred to me that I was not moving forward. There was no progress. In fact, I made all the progress in the first 5-6 months and for almost a year I didn&amp;#39;t make any progress. Neither strength not physique wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was now following a workout app called Calisthenics. It&amp;#39;s not too bad except it used ridiculously high volume and hardly any change in intensity. I was exhausted after each session, but no substantial progress was made... (to be continued)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;● Strength level during this period - 10-12 pull ups, 25 push ups, 12 dips (all max)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;2.2. Training (part 2 August 2020 - Now)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was becoming suspicious of what I was doing and the advice I was getting. During this time (May-June 2020) I read the book Power to the People by Pavel Insulin and it almost completely changed the way I looked at exercising. It was something very new and interesting. I started getting more and more curious about the concept of strength training; started reading more about it on the internet, frequently visiting Powerlifting related forums and getting more knowledge about bodyweight training. Then I got the book &amp;quot;Science and Practice of Strength Training&amp;quot; by Vladimir Zatsiorsky and &amp;quot;Building the Gymnatics Body&amp;quot; by Christopher Sommer.  And it changed everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started building and following my own routine and made huge changes to my training (this is around August-September). The major changes was making the rep range 3-5, upping the intensity, taking more rest time, reducing the number of exercises and focusing compound movements while applying the concept of progressive overload. And my strength increased rapidly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to know that all this while I was training at home at around 3am (then I used to sleep at daytime and stayed up all night). And for equipment I only had a light red resistance band. I used the kitchen counter to do dips and used an old backpack + some bricks for extra weight in pull ups and dips. In June I bought a pair of gymnastics rings which I hung from the gate. And in late October I started going to the park very early morning (5am) worked out there. I also bought a heavy band (50-70lbs) this November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;● Current strength level - max weighted pull ups is approx 25kg (with a brick between my legs), max weighted dip would be around 30kg (I can do about 4-5 reps with the same brick mentioned above). Chest to Wall Handstand Push Up 5 reps (still can&amp;#39;t balance a handstand). 3-4 one arm push ups on each arm (clean form). I can hold a straddle front lever for 5-6 seconds but I&amp;#39;m not training Front Lever anymore so that I can fully focus on one arm chin up training. For one arm chin up I can do band assisted (same light band) OAC with 1 finger distance from the ring and where I hold the band. For back lever (supinated) I can hold about 10s of advance tuck open hips, I feel like I&amp;#39;m almost ready for straddle. I&amp;#39;m also training for bent arm planche on Rings where I&amp;#39;m at around 12-15s with advance tuck open hip position. I&amp;#39;m working on my handstand but still can&amp;#39;t balance it. I can hold an L Sit on the floor for 20s. Max bodyweight pull is 15-16. I can also do about 5-6 full Dragon Flag however I never trained for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;3. Routine&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow a template, not a fixed routine as exercises keep changing as I move up the progression ladder. It looks somewhat like this -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. OAC Progression 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B1. Back Lever 3-4 sets of 3-5/5s-15s superset with 
B2. 10 Reverse Hyperextension (3 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C1. Weighted pull up 3 sets of 6-8 (2 min rest)
False Grip Hang 3 sets of max hold superset with 
C2. Bicep curls with that ~25kg brick to failure (1m 30s rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. The hardest pushing exercise that I can do (right now it is RTO Dips with Rings 90° turned out through out the whole movement) 5 sets of 3-5 (3 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. Elevated Dominik Sky style pike push up 4 sets of 5-8 (3 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C. Bent Arm Planche progression on Rings 3 sets of 10s-20s (2 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D. Weighted Dip + heavy band 3 sets of 5-8 (2 min rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E. Bodyweight Triceps Extension 3 sets of 10-12 (1m 30s rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then repeat day 1...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with these I also train handstand for 20-30 min a day and flexibility + mobility for an hour but different time of the day. Everything combined it takes me about 3 hours a day for a full training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;4. Nutrition&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hypertrophy or weight gain (and loss) diet is one of the most important factors. However I&amp;#39;m helpless in this situation. I can&amp;#39;t afford enough food to get big. I eat what is cooked in home. I don&amp;#39;t track my macros or calories. I eat rice twice a day (as lunch and dinner) with curries, a glass of milk, I&amp;#39;m not a vegetarian but I rarely eat meat because it&amp;#39;s expensive, I also don&amp;#39;t eat fish because it tastes very bad, I eat 1 banana before training right after waking up, 2 eggs, loads of potato and for breakfast or snacks in the evening I eat bread with peanut butter. I also drink sattu which contains a good amount of soy protein (about 20g in 100g/2 glass). I have only gained about 10lbs this year which speaks volume about my diet however there is nothing I can do about that.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"The advice in this post is by no means groundbreaking, but I thought it might be helpful for newcomers to the sub who are self-proclaimed ectomorphs/hardgainers and are struggling to put on weight.  

In the morning, in addition to your normal breakfast you're going to make a high-calorie protein/mass-gaining shake.  I'd say aim for \~1000 calories in it (this can vary depending on your calorie needs), and use whole foods, i.e don't drink some store-bought massgainer filled with sugar and other crap. I'm not going to dump a recipe in this post because there are plenty of different shakes to be found by searching on this subreddit or elsewhere.  However, I do have my own recipe that's worked very well for me so if people want to know what it is I'd be happy to share in the comments.  

Again, this isn't a replacement for your normal breakfast or another meal.  Instead, you're going to drink this throughout the day, in between meals or during meals, whenever, as long as you get it down.  This is even easier to do now since many people are still working/taking classes from home.  If you are out of the house for a while during the day, get one of those big hydroflask etc. bottles that will keep it from getting gross and drink it throughout the day.  You can drink it in one sitting if you prefer, but I sometimes feel too sick after doing that.  

This was a game-changer for me the first time I was serious about gaining weight in college a few years ago.  It's much easier to consume/digest a shake than adding an extra big plate of chicken/spinach/rice, and you can get even more calories anyway.  If you spread out your consumption throughout the day you barely notice how much extra food you're getting on top of your normal 3-4 meals.  

Some of you new guys may have already started doing this, and if so props to you because you're on the right path.  Also, this is definitely not something you must do.  You don't need any liquid calories to gain, but if you feel like you're already eating as much as you can, then add this to your diet and I guarantee you will see results.

,gainit,"Mythical Strength recently made a post talking about GOMAD and pushed me to make a post sharing my experiences, as I've been doing it since 2018 (with a 10 month break because I stopped training). [Here is his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/kug8ma/the_gallon_of_milk_a_day_gomad_doing_it_right). He specifically stated GOMAD is not sustainable and I'm going to go over why that's wrong. I'll include some tips that winners do as well.

Disclaimer: You don't do this for health reasons, I am in no way advocating you should drink a gallon of milk every day to get more vitamin D. You do it because of the calories, macros, price, and most of all it's so fucking easy. If you can tolerate milk and have trouble gaining weight then I have no sympathy for you. Also I'd like to point out that my opinion doesn't matter, but I'm gonna give it to you anyway.

I'm 6'3, before I started lifting I weighed 165lbs. My peak is 240lbs. I took a long break from lifting and dropped down to 170ish by the time I returned, which was this past August. I am now back to 230 with most of my strength back. I don't know why I feel compelled to say this, but if your activity level goes way down, stop drinking so much milk.

Always whole milk, anything else and you're just pulling your pud. Also, put the empty pints away, drink it straight from the jug or you'll spend all day pouring and doing dishes. 

Much like training, you don't start out pounding a gallon of milk in one sitting. That is one of my goals, but I always chicken out after a half gallon. I started out at 3 gallons a week, and I wasn't even trying to do GOMAD, it was just how much milk I drank. I jumped to 4 very quickly after that and that's when I realized how little effort it took to gain weight versus actually having to chew so much damn food. From there it just felt intuitive and I drank it like water. If you want to reach a gallon a day, progressively overload your milk intake, you will hardly notice it once you have achieved a gallon a day/enlightenment. When you are drinking that much milk, drinking it is refreshing. If I ever get nausea, milk is the first thing I reach for. When I use to go to commercial gyms, I would bring a big ass thermos that held about a quarter gallon of milk with me and drink it between sets.

Maintaining for the long term works great assuming you don't develop some sensitivity towards lactate. Here are three questions people ask me when they find out I drink a lot of milk:

**Won't that make you really fat?**- It can if you don't use your body for anything. 

**Isn't that really unhealthy?**- It's probably not the healthiest thing you could be doing, but it's not as bad as you might think. I've had plenty of checkups with my doctor and blood tests. The only thing that was abnormal in my blood tests is creatinine levels, which are elevated because that's what they do when you exercise. Also, there are people that drink soda everyday and I rarely feel the need to ever drink any because I slam so much milk.

**Doesn't that get crazy expensive?**- No. Think of all of the other things you don't have to buy because so much of your intake is coming from milk, then compare how much that costs to milk. It's pretty damn efficient moneywise. You don't need to buy whey either, protein powder is just derivatives of milk anyway so it's redundant. 

I'm closing, GOMAD isn't a meme. Weighing less than 200lbs as an adult male is, and maxing out your bodyweight squat/deadlift while taking 3 different supplements + mass gainer then complaining about being skinny is. Adding raw weight to your body and lifts isn't.  It is sustainable and will probably make your life easier, as a big chunk of your macros and calories are predetermined. In fact, it's really well suited as a long term approach.

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: You don&amp;#39;t do this for health reasons, I am in no way advocating you should drink a gallon of milk every day to get more vitamin D. You do it because of the calories, macros, price, and most of all it&amp;#39;s so fucking easy. If you can tolerate milk and have trouble gaining weight then I have no sympathy for you. Also I&amp;#39;d like to point out that my opinion doesn&amp;#39;t matter, but I&amp;#39;m gonna give it to you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 6&amp;#39;3, before I started lifting I weighed 165lbs. My peak is 240lbs. I took a long break from lifting and dropped down to 170ish by the time I returned, which was this past August. I am now back to 230 with most of my strength back. I don&amp;#39;t know why I feel compelled to say this, but if your activity level goes way down, stop drinking so much milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always whole milk, anything else and you&amp;#39;re just pulling your pud. Also, put the empty pints away, drink it straight from the jug or you&amp;#39;ll spend all day pouring and doing dishes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like training, you don&amp;#39;t start out pounding a gallon of milk in one sitting. That is one of my goals, but I always chicken out after a half gallon. I started out at 3 gallons a week, and I wasn&amp;#39;t even trying to do GOMAD, it was just how much milk I drank. I jumped to 4 very quickly after that and that&amp;#39;s when I realized how little effort it took to gain weight versus actually having to chew so much damn food. From there it just felt intuitive and I drank it like water. If you want to reach a gallon a day, progressively overload your milk intake, you will hardly notice it once you have achieved a gallon a day/enlightenment. When you are drinking that much milk, drinking it is refreshing. If I ever get nausea, milk is the first thing I reach for. When I use to go to commercial gyms, I would bring a big ass thermos that held about a quarter gallon of milk with me and drink it between sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining for the long term works great assuming you don&amp;#39;t develop some sensitivity towards lactate. Here are three questions people ask me when they find out I drink a lot of milk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Won&amp;#39;t that make you really fat?&lt;/strong&gt;- It can if you don&amp;#39;t use your body for anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that really unhealthy?&lt;/strong&gt;- It&amp;#39;s probably not the healthiest thing you could be doing, but it&amp;#39;s not as bad as you might think. I&amp;#39;ve had plenty of checkups with my doctor and blood tests. The only thing that was abnormal in my blood tests is creatinine levels, which are elevated because that&amp;#39;s what they do when you exercise. Also, there are people that drink soda everyday and I rarely feel the need to ever drink any because I slam so much milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that get crazy expensive?&lt;/strong&gt;- No. Think of all of the other things you don&amp;#39;t have to buy because so much of your intake is coming from milk, then compare how much that costs to milk. It&amp;#39;s pretty damn efficient moneywise. You don&amp;#39;t need to buy whey either, protein powder is just derivatives of milk anyway so it&amp;#39;s redundant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m closing, GOMAD isn&amp;#39;t a meme. Weighing less than 200lbs as an adult male is, and maxing out your bodyweight squat/deadlift while taking 3 different supplements + mass gainer then complaining about being skinny is. Adding raw weight to your body and lifts isn&amp;#39;t.  It is sustainable and will probably make your life easier, as a big chunk of your macros and calories are predetermined. In fact, it&amp;#39;s really well suited as a long term approach. It works, and it works a lot better if you&amp;#39;re working hard enough to warrant it.&lt;/p&gt;

I still have a long ways to go, but I’ve enjoyed my time in this sub, thanks for everyone who has helped! I know none of this stuff is revolutionary, and I am not as good of a writer as some poster on here, but this is what I would have told myself 10 weeks ago:

-Don’t go “all in” right away. I think this is a common mistake, I realized I really needed to put on weight, got a little scared, and ended up eating the most food I had had in a single sitting. I felt like crap for the next 2 days. I felt full for these days and in turn, probably ended up eating less.

-I was eating a lot less than I thought I was. Again, I think this is pretty common, I thought I was eating a lot, but when you don’t eat for 6,7,8 hours after breakfast, it’s almost impossible to get in enough calories. 

-I feel so much better, in almost all aspects of life. I no longer feel tired all the time, I’m getting better sleep, and despite it being counterintuitive, I am literally running faster than I ever have in my life. I was hesitant to “bulk” as a distance runner, because a low body weight is so emphasized in the sport. But too little is probably worse than too much, I look forward to running so much more, and have a new love for the sport. 

-I don’t care if I put on a bit of fat. I definitely had some body image issues going on, and thought I wouldn’t like how I looked bigger, it’s the complete opposite. I look more full, and yes I have some fat, but that’s honestly for the better in my case. 

-I’m weak as hell. This is more of a goal looking to the future, as I have made major progress, but still can’t really lift to save my life. I’ve been running Westside for Skinny Bastards, and seriously enjoyed it. 

In the end, I may not have put on as much weight or even as much muscle as I probably could have. I missed meals, messed up workouts and so on.

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I may not have put on as much weight or even as much muscle as I probably could have. I missed meals, messed up workouts and so on. But I&amp;#39;m doing what makes me feel the best and be the happiest and don’t regret any of it. I feel so much better than I did beforehand, and plan on only getting stronger and better. If anyone has questions I am happy to answer. Thanks again gainers for all your posts, they’ve really inspired me&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hi all! I am 32, 170cm (~5ft 7"") 70kg (~154b)

Two months ago, after losing enough body fat, I started a bulking phase (for the first time in my life). As I read everywhere, I started increasing bit by bit my caloric intake, however I kept losing weight, so I ended up reaching 3000 calorie/day, and now I am finally gaining weight.

However, according to my scale (which, although not very precise, is quite consistent), the rate at which I am gaining seems, at least to me, quite slow.

When I started the bulking, I was around 68kg (~150lb). After two months (the first one I was adjusting the caloric intake, and then Christmas came...), while in an upper/lower workout routine for 4 days a week + some cardio after upper training + 1 specific cardio day, I am at 70kg (~154lb). According to the scale, I gained approximately 1kg of muscle, and 2 points of bf percentage.

My caloric intake atm is approximately 3000 calories, divided in 100 fat / 350 carbs / 180 protein (dancing a bit around those numbers).

,gainit,"I've been lifting seriously for around 3-4 years.

I weigh 78kg or 173lbs and am around 16% bodyfat @ 5ft 8/173cm/1.72 m

My nutrition is great and I always hit my macros.


I usually train one body part a day and always push myself very hard. I don't really reserve energy and go to failure in all my working set. 

Monday: Chest
Always start with heavy dumbell press 5 sets of 5 reps, 4 sets of failure for upper and lower chest on incline dumbell press, 5 sets of cable or dumbell flys

Tuesday: Biceps
15 minutes of light weight, trying to activate my bicep and get good mind muscle connection (biceps are terrible)
Usually superset weighted pullups into seated bicep curls and then a burn out with lower weight. I repeat these 3 exercises 4 times with around a minute and a half rest time between

Wednesday: Back
Back really isn't an issue for me as I have decent genetics for it. Seated row machine for 5 sets of failure reps into 4 sets of bent over rows, and then 4 sets of rack pulls to failure

Thursday: Shoulders
Shoulders are similar to my back, where I have decent genetics. I usually start with something like a seated shoulder press doing 10+ reps to failure for 4 sets and then doing the same with rear delt flys. I will then usually do a burnout drop set

Friday: Legs
Begin with heavy squats, 5 sets of 5 into 4 sets of 10+ reps to failure on leg press. 4 sets of machine leg extensions to 10+ reps failure and the same with hamstring curls. Then I finish off with calf raises with weight to failure for 8 or so sets. My calves suck...

So I've been running the FAQ 6 day PPL program which has me deadlifting once a week.

From June 2018 to January 2021

Disclosure: I had a little weight training experience from college so some of these gains were ""muscle memory-esque"". Really never looked anything close to impressive in college though, and I feel I hit college level after a month or two of lifting again.

There was one cut between these photographs. It was from 213lbs to 187lbs and I would consider it a failure considering how much muscle/strength I lost.

My routine started as a high volume high intensity ""fucking around"" routine where I focused on mind muscle connection and doing what I wanted. Gained some good size doing that, but lost a bunch from my cut.

I eventually decided to start tracking my lifts and following an actual program and have been doing the following routine for about a year and half: https://rippedbody.com/intermediate-bodybuilding-program/

I modify the program to fit my needs in many ways though. It's more of a skeleton. It has been quite successful for me.

I eat a ton of food, usually only focusing on protein goals. I take creatine and sometimes whey protein. Chicken, rice, canned fish, sweets, fruits, milk, nuts, stews, etc. Gaining weight through the 220s was very slow going and tough.

I hope it doesn't need to be said due to my size and conditioning, but I am very much natty.

,gainit," Hey there. I'm 17 and have been going to the gym properly for around about 1 year now. Starting off, I did the whole eat big to get big thing and ended up getting a bit fat so I decided to do a body recomposition after about 6-7 months. I did a decent amount of research on how to do it, however after the first two months the physique didn't really change. The past 3 months have seen some changes, I've lost around 4kg and my body fat went from approx 22% to around 17-18% (according to the scales) and I've put on some muscle. Essentially, I'm a bit leaner and a little bit bigger then before I start working out. Because of the slow progression, I've been debating undergoing a proper cut, getting lean, before beginning to seriously bulk. Some advice on whether or not do this would be greatly appreciated.

Before I forget, I do track my calories as best I can (eating a slight surplus on the days I workout and a deficit on rest days) as well as tracking my progress in the gym. I did start off quite physically inept having embarrassingly low one rep maxes on the main 3, despite this, they've now risen to mind blowing highs of: 75kg for bench, 90kg for squat and 120 for deadlift. My progression in the gym and lack thereof in the physique is my reason for the post, so some wise words would be awesome.

Hey everyone, I wanted to ask you guys what are some realistic strength goals to set for the new year, and what may be good programs or programming ideas to achieve these goals 

Here [https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/workouts/stevedensitystrength.pdf ] is my current program, I’m on week 14 of 16, and I really like it, and I’ve been making good progress (+5 pounds every week on all my barbell lifts) 

I’ve attached my current estimated ORM’s (estimates by symmetric strength, I’ve also included the lifts I imputed to calculate those maxes, or in some cases estimates done by me), it’s important to note before running my current program I did all stupid self programming and really only wanted to gain strength in weights Dio’s and chins ups, so I have terrible strength imbalances. I didn’t even start OHPing until about may of 2020. I was a big idiot. Some imbalances are also because I train from home and have limited equipment so I was not or currently am not able to train certain movements. 

I am 18, 5’10 and weigh 210lbs, I first started working out with basic calisthenics almost 3 years ago, my estimated maxes are 

Bench: 260-270 (225-230X5-6)
OHP 180 (165X3)
Deadlift:315X6-8
Barbell Hack squat (don’t have a squat rack) 315X6-8
Weighted dip +135X8-10 
Weighted chin up: +90X3-5
Cheat row:255X8-9

*if it changes anything, I do my OHP from my bench by putting the pegs at the highest slot, and then turning and facing the wall while seated, but no back support. 

*DIps and chins numbers were from lifts from when I was a little lighter, though I’m fairly certain as I’ve gained weight I’ve kept the same weight added. 



I really look forward to getting stronger, I’d like to build up my bench, OHP, and deadlift a lot, but I also would like to continue in strengthening my Dips and Chins. Should I re run my current program or maybe look into something new? Maybe try something totally different or invest I chains or a sling shot?

,gainit,"Howdy Gainers,

**INTRO**

The infamous ""GOMAD"" approach to gaining weight has been around for about a hundred years now, with pioneers such as Milo Steinborn and Joseph Curtis (JC) Hise leading the charge on it in it's infancy and other great men of strength such as Paul Anderson and Doug Hepburn continuing it's momentum.  It's been written about by authors such as John McCallum and Randall Strossen, and even advocated by more modern types such as Chase Karnes and Matt Reynolds.  HOWEVER, as is often the case with great ideas, the telephone game (I'm dating myself there I'm such: do kids call it the textmessage game now?) has been in effect, and much of the truth behind this method has been lost.  I figure it's worth having a discussion on the subject.


**MY BACKGROUND/EXPERIENCE**

I did the gallon of milk a day approach to gaining back in 2006, while I was in college and on a meal plan, which definitely made things easier.  I paired it with the ""Super Squats"" program, as that is where the idea was heavily emphasized.  You can read about that program [here](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Super+Squats&amp;qid=1610290584&amp;sr=8-1).

In the 6 weeks I drank the gallon of milk a day and ran the program, I also ate a diet that consisted of a LOT of food, and ended up putting on 12lbs in 6 weeks.  I drank 2% milk, as we did not have whole milk in our dinning hall.

Prior to drinking a gallon of milk a day, I had legit not had milk as a beverage since my childhood.   This required a re-acclimation to milk, which I will discuss momentarily.

**WHAT GOMAD IS NOT**

* Healthy.  Understand that from the forefront.  That's not the point of it.  If your goal is maximal health, you should NOT be drinking a gallon of milk a day.  

* Sustainable.  This is a blitz approach, paired with extreme training, to get extreme results.  You won't be doing this for life.  6 weeks was right for me.  Some folks run it for longer. 

* A first resort.  A lot of trainees want to jump onto GOMAD right away, but this is something that's done AFTER you have real nutrition sorted out.  If you're living off weight gain shakes and don't know how to boil water, do NOT do GOMAD.  Learn to cook.  [Try here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ijjm9h/bachelor_bulking_quit_making_shakes_learn_how_to/)

**WHAT GOMAD IS**

* A way to get in an extra 2000+ calories a day with a ton of protein on TOP of a already heavy diet.  The reason milk is advocated is because liquid tends to ""fill in the cracks"" left behind when you have a full stomach.  Basically, you always have room for milk, so while you're mainlining solid calories you can use the milk to get in even MORE restorative calories to recover from VERY intense training.  And that's the thing: don't just drink a gallon of milk a day and run Starting Strength.  You need to be training hard enough that you NEED all those extra calories.

* A last resort.  Maybe not THE last resort, but things should definitely be squared away on the rest of the nutritional front BEFORE you do this.  A gallon of milk a day on top of a terrible diet is going to mean terrible results.

**MISTAKES PEOPLE MAKE**

* If you are like me and NOT a regular milk drinker, do NOT just jump into a gallon of milk a day overnight.  Super Squats and Brawn both talk about how one needs to ease into milk consumption.  I started off by drinking a glass of milk at night before bed for a week.  It was a great way to get in a few extra calories before sleeping, and helped get my gut used to milk while I was too busy being unconscious to feel it's effects.  I then started working a glass of milk into one of my meals of the day on top of the glass before bed.  Eventually all meals had a glass of milk with them, and then I was ready to fully commit to the process.

* On the above, I don't discount that people ARE lactose intolerant, but I also imagine some folks are just not accustomed to drinking milk, and easing into the process will help redevelop that tolerance.  If you ARE lactose intolerant, this is, of course, a terrible idea, and you should not do it.

* Drinking the milk too quickly.  Don't try to get your gallon knocked out so it's ""out of the way"": drink it over the course of the day.  You'll feel much better.

**IF I DID IT AGAIN**

I'd go with something like fairlife or raw milk personally.  As I get older, I'm trying to put better things in my body.  But for a broke college kid, ""free"" milk was awesome.

I have been tracking my weight daily for about a month now and it has only gone down about 2 pounds. I don't really know where to add more food to my day, especially the days that I work. I work at a fast-food restaurant (let's just say we are pretty popular here in the Midwest). I work from 5:30am-2pm four days a week. I don't eat breakfast before I leave my house seeing as I leave quite early. I eat my breakfast on my break at 8am and my lunch at 2:30pm when I get home. My schedule and calories is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

**Breakfast: (about 400 cal)**

handful or 2 of cheerios before leaving home, coffee on my drive, packed breakfast of apple, 1/2 pb and j

**Lunch/pre-workout meal: (about 400 cal)**

wrap made of tortilla, meat, mayo and mustard, veggie straws on side and usually a little caffeine boost for pre-workout

**Post-Workout: (150 cal)**

1 scoop ON protein powder with 1 cup of almond milk

**Dinner: (800-1000 cal)**

whatever my mom makes that night. usually consists of meat, potatoes, veggies. varies night to night, but I always eat 2 helpings

**Snack: (300ish cal)**

somedays I eat a bowl of cereal before bed, other nights I make a banana shake that totals about 300 cal. 

**Total each day:** about 2300-2400 cal

&amp;#x200B;

I know this number is below what I should be consuming, but the thing is I don't know where to add more food. I can't eat at work during my shift, so there's a long time period where I go without food. Once I get home I eat a quick supply of carbs and protein then go to the gym. I come home, have my shake, then eat dinner about 20 minutes later. 2 hours after dinner I eat another 300-400 cal snack then go to bed shortly after. I feel full after I eat, so I'm not saving any room or anything. 

I have been lifting on GZCLP for about 4 straight months now, and my gains are leveling off. I know I need to gain weight, but I am having trouble. I track calories religiously, and I read this subreddit till my eyes cross. I am obsessed with lifting, fitness, food, and gaining weight. I feel I may have an ED but I am unsure.

Throwaway-ish because I don't want any medical information associated with my main account.

Over the past several years, I've been dealing with some odd medical issues that have culminated in a tremendous amount of kidney stone passages, muscle weakness, fatigue, and other negative physiological symptoms.

I'm in my early 20s, the prime time to be putting on some muscle, so this threw a bit of a wrench into my plans.

I'm going to be be on a low-protein (\~.8-1 g/kg) + high alkaline (fruits and veggies) diet, absolutely zero creatine supplementation, and lower-calories overall (no more high-calorie surpluses, so close to  maintenance).

I ask for no sympathy, and am only posting this to remind everyone to keep maximizing your gains while you can - one day you might not have the option!

I know this subreddit usually leans towards *maximizing* gains, but any recommendations on *optimizing*  gains with a restricted diet are greatly appreciated. Of course, I'll talk to my doctor further, but the ""collective wisdom of the crowds"" in a subreddit often offers interesting ideas!

,gainit,"https://oatsandwheytoday.blogspot.com/2021/01/feed-conversion-ratio-simple-fact-of.html

What is the FEED CONVERSION RATIO, and does it have any relevance to hard-gainers? Yes, so tuck in for a long read. You need to know that foods you eat are not 100% utilized. You do not digest everything you eat. Some of the calories you eat slip out the other end. **Digestion is never 100% efficient.** How can we know this? Well, pardon the ""yuck""-factor, but if you've ever seen corn or peas in your stool, you know it. If lactose makes you gassy, that attests to this. The very fact that 30% of nuts you eat are eliminated, if not well-chewed, is also proof of this. THIS is why I often say, ""You're not a hard-gainer, you're a hard-digester"". This is often the result of mal-absorption.

**See, it's not how much you can eat, it's how much you can digest.** And some people are just ""not as good"" at digestion. This isn't your ""metabolism"", this is poor food utilization. Additional factors contribute to our ability to process the foods we eat. Food calories can be lost in other ways, to other physiological processes. But we want to maximize the conversion of our calories into weight gain, correct? This is why I wanted to take a moment to have a closer look at this concept of Feed Conversion Ratio. Where does this ratio come from? And does it have any relevance to a hardgainer simply trying to put on good weight?

This Feed Conversion Ratio comes from the livestock industry. These are the folks who fatten up pigs and cattle, to get them to market. These are the people who are highly invested in getting their animals quickly to a certain weight. The animal's gains are literally the farmer's profits. And it would be ideal if each pound of feed produced a pound of meat. But it's nowhere close to this number! The ratio averages 3:1 in the example of a pig. It takes roughly 3 pounds of feed to yield 1 pound of weight. As an example, you might feed 665 pounds of feed to a pig in the weeks it weighs between 40 pounds and 280 pounds. You would calculate the ratio as ""665 pounds of feed divided by 240 pounds of weight gain for a score of 2.77"". You could thus say ""the Feed Conversion Ratio is 2.77:1"" in this instance.

Now, every animal has a different score for feeding efficiency. For beef cattle, FCR calculated on live weight gain of 4.5–7.5 was in the normal range with an FCR above 6 being typical. Some data for sheep illustrate variations in FCR. An FCR (kg feed dry matter intake per kg live mass gain) for lambs is often in the range of about 4 to 5 on high-concentrate rations. As of 2011 in the US, broiler chickens has an FCR of 1.6 based on body weight gain, and mature in 39 days. A lower first number in the ratio is desirable, as less feed is required to yield the same amount of meat.

If it requires 6 pounds of feed to make each pound of beef, versus 3 pounds of feed to produce a pound of pork, versus only 1.6 pounds of feed to grow a pound of chicken, then it's obvious that chicken is more economic in the simple sense that you spend less on animal food to grow the animal for market sale. But even on a species-by-species basis, there is variance within the species breed-by-breed. Sure, the average for a pig is 3:1. But some breeds of pigs might require 3.5 pounds of feed, on average, to gain a pound of weight, while another breed of pig only needs 2.6 pounds of feed to gain that same pound of pork. The latter breed gains weight &amp; muscle with less food.

By this logic, we must extrapolate a conclusion that even among human people, there is not an equal ability to convert food into weight with an identical efficiency. We cannot assume that everyone responds to food (calories) in an identical manner. Is this due to ""metabolism""? Largely, NO. Studies in metabolic wards have confirmed that although some people do have higher basal metabolic rates (resting metabolism), the effect is very slight. It's on the order of about 150-200 calories. Of people with identical height, weight, and body composition, one person might burn 150 more calories in a day. That's really not a lot. So what's going on with hardgainers who swear up &amp; down that they're eating so much more than everyone else? Is this really happening?

First, can we even find a Feed Conversion Ratio for humans? It doubtlessly exists. But that would be beyond the scope of this article. Moreover, it would be highly impractical as well as unethical. For starters, we aren't eating an iso-caloric pelletized food kibble for all of our food intake needs. We also aren't looking at basic-rate growth from infancy-to-adulthood based on per-pound of feed; we're looking in the particular context of weight gain in response to resistance-training hypertrophy. But we don't need to know a rate of efficiency. It's enough to know that the absorption &amp; assimilation of food is variable. And it's affected by other variables, besides enzymatic digestion.

Environment and Temperature can have a big effect on appetite. A pig’s environment can affect its food consumption and conversion. The ambient temperature of the pen must be kept in the thermo-neutral range or it will have a negative influence on a pig’s appetite. Pigs that are cold will eat more feed. Pigs that are hot will eat less. High humidity can also reduce appetite, as can poor ventilation. As a human goes, I can personally attest that I don't want to eat as much when it's too warm, or too stuffy. If ""poor appetite"" is a complaint of yours, this could be one explanation: Your environment is simply too warm for you to get the signal to eat for warmth! A meal should make you warm, due in part to the thermic effect of food. Digesting food requires your body to ramp up, and if you're already warm, hunger may be blunted or muted altogether. And conversely, if it's far too cold, animals will eat more, but also burn more, for heat. Some calories will be lost to heat, when they could have been used for growth.

Are we pigs in a pen being raised for food? Certainly not. But is it unreasonable to assume ambient temperatures play a factor in appetite, as well as metabolism, in the human? Burning body fat for heat is an element of ""calories out"", and it's the largest component of non-exercise energy expenditure. Are you guilty of insisting on wearing a T-shirt in the house during Winter, instead of bundling up a little bit indoors? Not-eating when too warm can impair appetite some of the time, coupled with over-burning when exposed to cooler temperatures and needlessly burning calories for heat another part of the time, can both contribute to impaired weight gain for two different reasons.

Animal Stress also factors into appetite strength. If the density of pigs in the pen is too high, they will experience stress which results in eating less. I'm aware that only so many extrapolations can be made from our pig-farming corollary here, but this also bears legitimacy: People, too, often eat less in times of stress (some are known to eat more, but that's not our demographic). Common stress can play a big role in appetite impairment. So it goes without saying, you might be experiencing stressors in your life, even if unbeknownst to you. Making time to relax before eating a meal might help unlock some of that. A simple 10-minute walk to clear your head and get some fresh air can work wonders in giving your appetite the boost it needs. Mindfulness &amp; meditation may also promote de-stressing.

To shift back to another topic, there is also an effect that results in poor food utilization, which I call the ""Novel Meal Phenomenon"". This is the result of an excessively varied diet, to which the body does not have sufficient time to adapt. This is something you can observe if you've ever had a dog: They acclimatize to their particular brand of dog food and this produces a firm healthy stool. But if you switch food brands suddenly, they'll typically have loose stools for the next couple of days while they adjust to the different macro composition and nutritional profile of the food. This is why it is recommended to mix a little of the new food with the food the dog is already accustomed to, in order to gradually transition the dog to the new food over a couple of weeks, rather than switching all at once. This gives your canine companion some time to re-calibrate its own production of digestive enzymes.

When you are exposed to many of the same foods on a regular basis, your body starts to anticipate them and becomes more efficient at processing them. And although there's still not 100% conversion to usable calories for energy, repair, and growth, more of the total food value is harnessed. If you are often troubled by loose and sloppy bowel movements, it might be due to the novel foods that you've eaten; you've thrown your gut biome a curve-ball. (It's not that those foods are necessarily ""bad"", and had you eaten only those meals, you likewise would have adapted to them over time, by modifying your endogenous enzyme profile). It's a demonstrable fact many people are enzyme-deficient. Some have a poor stomach pH, and will not absorb foods the same way as someone else can. But this is easily remedied. There's a limit to what enzymes you can make, but not to which enzymes you can take.

This is why I'm continually recommending either supplemental digestive enzymes, or enzyme-rich food sources, or both, if you're trying to gain meaningful mass. If you provide digestive support, you will convert more of the foods you eat into mass. If you're hell-bent on running GOMAD (Gallon of Milk a Day), but milk always makes you gassy and crampy, Dairy is probably not a desirable candidate food. (Though if you're determined to attempt it, it would behoove you to either drink only lactose-free milk, or take a lactase-containing digestive supplement alongside it each time. What sense is there throwing a food into the mix, if you're unable to process a component of the food?) Additionally, there is value in probiotics for gut biome support. 

Simply lowering the stomach pH (making it more acidic) can also help. Eating more citrus fruits, berries, and fibrous greens is another tactic to improve digestion. You'll be getting necessary vitamin C, valuable polyphenols and other micro-nutrients, but the biggest value is in digestive support. They also contain fermentable carbs that nourish the gut biome. These are the intestinal bacteria that help digest your other foods. Some of the things you cannot digest, your gut flora will digest for you. Then, you digest the gut flora, and the circle is complete. A thriving gut biome is absolutely necessary not only for raw digestion, but for overall health. At times, I've also kept a bottle of lemon juice in the fridge (not lemonade, but un-sugared, un-watered-down pure lemon juice), of which I drink a Tablespoon-sized shot after a large and bloating meal; it greatly assists in breaking down foods.

Further, this is also why I recommend sticking to 3 or 4 of the same meals which comprise 90% of your bulking diet. Find a handful of meals you don't mind eating all the time. Beef &amp; rice, chicken &amp; pasta, chili &amp; cornbread, beef &amp; bean burritos, tuna sandwiches, whatever your jam is. Rotating through the same small selection of meals will make food prep easier, it will make calorie tracking easier, and it ultimately helps take the guesswork out of what to eat next when it's time to eat again. But equally important, your delicate gut biome will become more adept and adroit and maximizing food absorption. More of the calories you consume will convert into usable energy, primarily in the form of meaningful weight gain. Try thinking of your stomach &amp; intestines as a living creature you have to take care of, like an exotic pet. And when you provide for all the needs of this magical animal, it returns the favor by nourishing and growing YOUR body in return. When it is happy and healthy, it will bestow great gains upon you!

&lt;p&gt;What is the FEED CONVERSION RATIO, and does it have any relevance to hard-gainers? Yes, so tuck in for a long read. You need to know that foods you eat are not 100% utilized. You do not digest everything you eat. Some of the calories you eat slip out the other end. &lt;strong&gt;Digestion is never 100% efficient.&lt;/strong&gt; How can we know this? Well, pardon the &amp;quot;yuck&amp;quot;-factor, but if you&amp;#39;ve ever seen corn or peas in your stool, you know it. If lactose makes you gassy, that attests to this. The very fact that 30% of nuts you eat are eliminated, if not well-chewed, is also proof of this. THIS is why I often say, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not a hard-gainer, you&amp;#39;re a hard-digester&amp;quot;. This is often the result of mal-absorption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See, it&amp;#39;s not how much you can eat, it&amp;#39;s how much you can digest.&lt;/strong&gt; And some people are just &amp;quot;not as good&amp;quot; at digestion. This isn&amp;#39;t your &amp;quot;metabolism&amp;quot;, this is poor food utilization. Additional factors contribute to our ability to process the foods we eat.

,gainit,"I've recently developed a tendinous injury in the tricep tendon where it connects to the olecranon in the elbow joint. I notice this pain on my push days, originating with my bench press and becoming gradually worse after incline dumbbell press and peaking during tricep machine pushdowns. This leads me to believe my bench form is off, causing me to push mainly with my triceps rather than pecs. 

Besides lightening tricep load, I want to fix my form on these three exercises. I changed a lot in my bench press. First, I adopted a wider grip to emphasize the pecs, and also tried a bulldog grip with my hands. I also made sure to keep my elbows about 70-75º and not flare them out or into my torso. Finally, I'm more mindful of my upper body position: squeeze my scapulae together, push my chest out, and move the bar in a diagonal path rather than straight up and down. 

As for the tricep pulldown, I'm not sure what to change. I keep my elbows near my torso and my ROM is pretty wide, starting slightly above 90º and pushing down until my triceps stretch all the way. For some reason, this exercise hurts my elbow the most.

,gainit,"Hi,

I’m quite tall (191cm) and I weigh 65kg. I’m 22 years old. I’m very thin and I dream of weighing about 80 to 90kg (with muscles). I don’t think I’ll ever reach that anytime soon but in the meantime my mindset is to gain as much weight as I can.

In November, for about a month, I tried to have a proper diet : basically I multiplied by ~2 the quantity of food I usually eat. It was a difficult diet, both physically (it’s not easy to force myself when I just want to throw up) and financially. I didn’t try to « optimise » the diet by selecting only certain types of foods but instead, as I said, I just ate more of what I usually eat. Instead of having 100grams of pasta I would have 250grams. Instead of eating 3/4 of a pizza I would eat it all plus add 100grams of extra mozzarella. Same goes with other foods like chicken.

I must have had about 140 grams of proteins per day and more carbs than I needed (forgot the average quantity). I also have weights at home and did on average 20mins of workout per day. Despite this diet I didn’t gain a single gram (I weighed myself every evening before bedtime). It just makes no sense. I ate way more than I used to, so logically I should’ve been able to at the very least notice a small difference, right ? What’s more I did that during lockdown so my only physical activity were my workouts.

I stopped the diet not because I decided to give up but for ""logistical"" reasons (I went back to live with my family and I have very little authority in the kitchen ^^).

I was hoping someone could give me some advice on what to do now that I’m gonna go back to live alone and become independent. Any actionable tips? Maybe a secret life hack! I’m trying to find motivation to start again.

I was also wondering: considering I probably wouldn’t have any trouble burning fat (although I never experienced having fat in my entire life) would it be such a bad idea to eat a lot of junk food? I mean soda, sweets, chocolate bars and so on. I keep hearing people who avoid that sort of food because they’re afraid of getting fat. So why shouldn’t I just eat what fat peoples avoid eating?

Background info - 6’0” and started at 10 stone (140lbs), was tired of being super skinny and decided to do something about it February/March of 2020.

Diet - During this time I lived with my parents so I would eat what they provided, I’ve always had a small appetite and most of the time couldn’t finish the meal in front of me. I calculated that I need to eat an excess of 2700 calories a day for me to gain weight. When I saw this number I was initially blown away because I couldn’t believe that I would be able to reach that especially with my appetite. But then after working out my appetite became larger and I was more hungrier throughout the day. I would eat all my meals which would consist of mostly chicken, rice, beef burgers, sausages, bananas, pasta and omelettes. Only as of recently I’ve started integrating sardines into my diet. It goes without saying that I couldn’t of gained as much weight as I have if it wasn’t for high calorie protein shakes, I would combine this with all sorts of fruits and yoghurt and peanut butter to bump them calories up. 
I didn’t track my calories and only ate more if I wasn’t satisfied with my weight the next week.

Routine - When I started working out, it was peak lockdown so everything was closed. No gyms to go to so I had to do workouts at home. I had one Dumbbell that my father had and only applied 5 kgs to it to start. I did bicep curls, hammer curls, pretty much everything I could do with a single Dumbbell until failure and did press-ups to end the workout. This went of for only a few weeks until I bought some resistance bands and smaller dumbbells to do laterals. I continued this workout every other day whilst still eating well until gyms opened up again in August. I’ve never actually been into a gym to workout before so all the machines were alien to me, I did some research and found a full-body workout plan that I have decided to follow and am still following now.

WORKOUT A -
Squat - 60kg
Bench - 50kg
Barbell Row - 40kg
Overhead Press - 30kg
Skull Crushers - 10kg 
Barbell Curl - 30kg
Lateral Dumbell Raises - 6kg

Lat Pulldowns - 55
Incline Dumbell Bench - 16kg
Dumbell Row - 20kg
Tricep Pushdowns -

The workout alternates between A and B every other day.

,gainit,"So I try to gain weight. I know ideally it is nice to have a meal/shake before working out and then after. 

However, my stomach is smol. I don't even attempt to eat before working out. But I did try to drink a cup of shake. Waited like 20-30 mins and then worked out. Felt nauseous afterwards. Then I tried to just drink water and no shake before working out. When the workout ends, I feel so exhausted that I feel nauseous and no appetite to drink shakes or eat. Hmmm :l 

Any ideas? 

Note, I do have gastric problems. And also I am VERY sensitive to smells and flavors and especially when I feel exhausted and nauseated- I don't want anything, just plain water. 

I suspect the exhaustion makes me nauseated. But how to avoid feeling this way? Besides I don't even workout as in holy shit type of workout- just glutes and beginner back muscles exercise that is very simple (but I believe effective in time). I feel like I lack stamina?

I know ideally it is nice to have a meal/shake before working out and then after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my stomach is smol. I don&amp;#39;t even attempt to eat before working out. But I did try to drink a cup of shake. Waited like 20-30 mins and then worked out. Felt nauseous afterwards. Then I tried to just drink water and no shake before working out. When the workout ends, I feel so exhausted that I feel nauseous and no appetite to drink shakes or eat. Hmmm :l &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, I do have gastric problems. And also I am VERY sensitive to smells and flavors and especially when I feel exhausted and nauseated- I don&amp;#39;t want anything, just plain water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect the exhaustion makes me nauseated. But how to avoid feeling this way? Besides I don&amp;#39;t even workout as in holy shit type of workout- just glutes and beginner back muscles exercise that is very simple (but I believe effective in time). I feel like I lack stamina? Where to get it if I can&amp;#39;t ingest food/shakes before the workout?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance :)&lt;/p&gt;

https://i.imgur.com/Ix89CRo.jpg

Overview: Like many here I had always been very skinny, and while I generally did a lot of physical activities (running, hiking, etc.) I had never lifted before late Jan 2019. At that point though I decided to start lifting. My starting weight was about 118 lbs and I am currently at 142 lbs though I have been a little higher at times during 2020. I got a barbell rack in 2019 which helped a lot maintaining lifting through the virus.

Routine: From Jan 2019 - Nov 2019 I did stronglifts 5x5. While some say it isn't a super balanced program, I thought it was good to be able to focus on the core barbell lifts for a while. In Nov 2019 I switched to Reddit PPL which I have been doing up to the present. Any machine-related exercises in Reddit PPL I substituted with some sort of dumbbell exercise.

Diet: I did not generally track calories other than occasionally to see how I was doing. Most common foods were the normal oatmeal, protein powder, whole milk, chicken, rice, peanut butter. I most likely would have made more progress if I had tracked more often.

Current lifts: I haven't tested 1 RM but these are my current working weights (I don't know exactly where each started in 2019 but much lower):
-Deadlift 1x5 300# 
-Squat 3x5 235#
-Barbell Row: 5x5 155#
-BP: 5x5 150#
-OHP: 5x5 85#

,gainit,"Hi guys,

For a little bit of background, I am 21m
172cm (5'7)
70kg (154 lbs)

I have been physiqually active almost throughout my whole life. I have been doing rock climbing, crossfit, runnining, cycling and gymnastics and other sports at some point of my life. I have always been around 65kg (143lbs) but never actually looked skinny. In fact since I am short, I was looking rather fine. I never bothered to gain weight because I was already feeling in a great shape and being Light helps for climbing. I could always do 20 pull ups, run 10km, do 50 push ups at any point.

Then, 2 years ago I had to start a night shift job and it all went away. I was eating like shit, feeling like shit all the time, was not working out, ordering pizza, barely doing something active on my days off. At some point, my weight was 90kg (198lbs). It was not only 90kg, but 90kg of pure fat ! So when October came I got my shit together and décided to do a hardcore version of sober October. I cut off sugar in ANY form, bread (and all bread-like stuff) and alcohol. I also started running occasionally about 2, 3 or 5 km and doing some push ups, bodyweight squats etc. and Now I am back to 70kg and I am maintaining this weight for the last 1 month. it feels great! I am starting to get my old form one step at the time. The thing is, I would like to gain some weight. My mental goal is 80kg (176lbs) but what I am afraid of is that by gaining it, I will eventually lose my explosivness, agility, endurance.

So yes, I know that this is not easy at all but would you please give me your two cents on how do u think I could gain weight, improve my explosivness and endurance at the same time?

I don't have a lot of photos of myself. This is one from yesterday. It's not very seeable. It was taken on 7 degrees water bath but you can get a vague idea. Haha

,gainit,"I hope something like this is appropriate for this sub. I'm not super strong  but I think my experience was unique enough to warrant a post.

**Background**

I was recently reunited with my weights after a 3 month hiatus where I did very little exercise and no weights.

I was inspired to run the program because of [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/jnz7zu/locked_down_only_have_a_barbell_and_limited_time/) write up by /u/mythicalstrength. His posts are honestly all gold but this one just really pushed me to try.

I followed the program as best I could with the equipment I had. I don't have plates below 5kg/11lbs, I don't have a squat rack, my only bar is a 5ft axle, and I train outside. This being in Ireland, that usually means pissing rain. But I think I stuck pretty closely to the base program and I even did pullovers!

Because I don't have the smaller plates I figured I would start at 20 and add reps every session. If I got 30 I would increase weight.

**The Program**

I won't explain the whole 6 week program, if you're interested I would buy the book. It's cheap, entertaining, and pretty convincing. I got my copy [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Super-Squats-Pounds-Muscle-Weeks/dp/0926888005)

I ran it in an A/B format. On Day A I did Behind the Neck Press, Zerchers, Pullovers, and Pullups. On Day B I did Dips, Zerchers, Pullovers, and High Pulls. I needed to get good at cleans to press anything which is why I did the high pulls.

I also did curls twice.

**Results**

   | Metric Before| Metric After| Imperial Before| Imperial After
---|---|----|----|----
**BW**| 86kg| 93kg| 190lbs| 205lbs
**Zerchers**| 60kgx8| 70kgx25 | 132lbsx8| 155lbsx25
**BtN Press**| ???| 50kgx3x8| ???| 110lbsx3x8
**Dips**| 86kg+10kgx6| 93kg+20kgx12| 190lbs+22lbsx6| 205lbs+44lbsx12
**High Pull**| 60kgx5| 70kgx8| 132lbsx5| 155lbsx8

\*Pictures Removed\*

I'm 186cm/6'1.

**Nutrition**

When I started I thought eating would be a total chore, but actually the appetite just really came to me. 

I ate 4 or 5 meals a day, usually eggs for breakfast, bacon or beef for lunches, dinner was whatever. I would say 95% of those meals involved me cooking something rather than just eating out of a packet. I was very conscious of getting enough vegetables into my diet. If you're eating more fats and protein you need to eat more fibre too. Usually I threw in a few vegetables with the meat and then had salad with the meal. I drank a lot of milk everyday but definitely not a gallon. I had maybe one beer a week.

**What's next?**

This program really taught me to work hard.  The first session, where I took what was a very hard weight for eight and somehow did 20 felt like it was the hardest thing I'd ever done up until that point. Then I did the next session. I was never entirely sure if I could add that extra rep until I did it. Adding weight was basically a relief because it meant I was back down to 20 reps.

I definitely couldn't run anymore of this program though. My quads, calves, upper back and erectors are basically always sore, I wasn't able to keep my conditioning up, I've torn through two pairs of jeans, and I had a small touch of hip pain in the last week. This is definitely not a program you run year round.

That said, I'm pretty happy with my results.

,gainit,"Hi guys. I am 19 years old and I'm a bit tired about my situation with my body. 

I'm 180cm tall and I weigh about 154lbs.  It might seem that I'm pretty skinny, but this is not true at all.

In fact, my arms and my legs are skinny af, while my abdomen is covered by fat. I have already tried, during the last month, to follow a diet aiming to gain some mass, but what I got was just ""swell"" more in the abdominal area, while remaining very thin on the arms, shoulders, chest and legs, altough my workouts were really exhausting.

Surfing the internet, I think I can place myself in the category of **Skinny Fats** , and I have also found out that there is a possible solution to solve this problem: some months of body recomposition.


I had such a structured diet in mind:

my TDEE is about **2100kcal** 

**Workout Days:** 2100+20% = **2520kcal** - 3/4 days/week

**Rest Days:** 2100-20% = **1680kcal** - 3/4 days/week

With the macros divided as follows:

Protein: **160g**

Fat: **60g** (40g unsatured, 20g satured)

Carbs: **334g** Workout Days, **125g** Rest Days

Water: **2,5L/3L /day**

All this will be accompanied by free body workouts (unfortunately we are in Italy and we will be in quarantine for a while longer) whose main exercises will be:

Pectoral: pushups, raised leg pushups and some other variations

Dorsal: Chin-ups back and forth

Biceps: Curl with fitness bands or with something else

Shoulders: Front lifts with fitness bands

Hamstrings: deadlifts

Quadriceps: squats

Abdomen: crunch, reverse crunch and something else

What do you think? Do you have any advice to give me about workouts and, mostly, about diet?

**Background Info**    
For my European/metric friends, I am 1.78 meters and went from 52kg to 68kg in a year (+16kg). Did not grow in height, maybe this will be the year?    
    
**Diet**    
I eat intuitively and whatever I want, in moderation. Lately, I like pasta and Cheerios. I don't track calories, but eat consistently the same foods. If I had to guess, 2500 calories for the first 6 months, then 3000 calories from months 6 to 12. Right now is slightly more but again, I don't track so I wouldn't know the exact numbers. Consistency is what matters.    
    
**Routine**    
Did [Reddit's bodyweightfitness routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) for 6 months, then switched to [Reddit's PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/) for 1 year.    
    
**Lifts**    
Started with the bar (45 lbs) for everything. After 6 months in the gym, I could bench and squat 135 lbs for 8 reps. Deadlift was 185 lbs for 5 reps.    
Now, I can bench 135 lbs for 15 reps, and squat 165 for 8 reps. Switched out traditional deadlifts for RDLs, slow and controlled at 155 lbs for 15 reps.     
   
**Things that have changed**    
Clothes fit better.    
I feel happier, have more energy, and stopped caring about gaining ""fat"".    
I stopped lifting more than I could handle and instead focused on form. Deep squats are rewarding.    
My mental health has improved. Only took a (excuse my language) fucking pandemic for me to learn that this is the one body that I have, and I should take care of it.

,gainit,"Hey all,

I'm here with another progress picture from my lean bulk. I'm officially done with month 6, and I'm super happy with my progress. Really, I'm ecstatic with my progress. 

[From June 15th of 2019 to Yesterday (Dec 31st)](https://imgur.com/gallery/4mhuIML)

I've been doing a lean bulk at 250kcal over my maintenance. Obviously some days, I'll eat more, but by and large, I don't go over 300 over. It's been really nice to feel like I'm getting stronger without gaining too much body fat.

[6 month bulking progress](https://imgur.com/a/rlCYlmk)

Though, I am starting to see my lifts stall out a little. On Friday of last week, I wasn't able to finish my 5th set of squats, and only got 2 into it, before I went down. So, yesterday, I deloaded by 10lbs, banged out a full set without any issue. So, Monday, I'll hit it again back at my normal weight.

My issue is I think I'm not eating enough. Weightwise, I'm going up how I want, but I'm learning more and more that I should be eating for proper recovery and to see my lifts go up... not just to gain muscle. 

So, I'll be increasing my intake by another 250kcal to 500 over maintenance and see how I feel. It'll only be for another 2 months, but I have the feeling that the extra food will go a long way to help out my growth. I wanna hit that 1000lb club.

Current PRs aren't super, but I'm happy since just starting in July. 

Bench - ~180lb

Squat - ~285lb

Deadlift - ~405lb

At the moment, my program is based purely on hypertrophy with my squat and DL being in strength ""ranges"" for sets.

I'm really happy with my progress, and I am getting more and more enjoyment out of lifting and getting stronger. Though... shirts are becoming an issue.

,gainit,"Just been placed in another lockdown with gyms closing yet again.

It has been impossible to get into a consistent routine &amp; bulk phase now because of this. 

I have resistance bands but without a proper gym, machinery and weights I feel like it’s very very hard to bulk properly.

On my weight gain journey I’ve gone from 67kg to 75kg, I’m 5’11 so it’s not actually THAT much, but it’s a huge difference from what I used to be - but I’m still quite “slim”.

My plan was to hit the early 80s for my weight, and then cut down and maintain my lean body.

Even thought I’m only 75kg, is it time to maybe try a cutting phase and get more lean?

&lt;p&gt;I have resistance bands but without a proper gym, machinery and weights I feel like it’s very very hard to bulk properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my weight gain journey I’ve gone from 67kg to 75kg, I’m 5’11 so it’s not actually THAT much, but it’s a huge difference from what I used to be - but I’m still quite “slim”.&lt;/p&gt;

**Should I go into a maintenance/lean surplus phase as to not lose muscle like I might if I continue my cut with this lower intensity routine?**

Tonight he came over and asked me how I was progressing and what my 3 max reps are. I have not maxed in a while so I told him I wasn’t sure. At this point he said.. let’s find out. 

Long story short, this guy worked me up to a 375 1 rep deadlift PR. And it felt fucking GOOD. 

In that moment we bonded. He helped show me what I am truly capable of and what it takes to start seriously progressing in my deadlift (and this same principle carry’s over to my squat).

I've been posting about once a month with progress pictures, and I've been very happy with my results so far. 

You have all been a huge inspiration to me, and I want to continue what I've learned and progressed.

In about 2 months, I will be ending my first bulk phase and cutting  down to 10-15% body fat. Not sure what I'm at now. I've been lean bulking for 6 months, and I've noticed that my weights are moving a little slower than I'd like. 

I will be increasing my caloric intake to 500 over maintenance to help with my strength gains, as I've felt my recovery hasn't been as good as it should. In fact, it might not even be 500 over maintenance.

Either way, in 2 months, I'll be done with bulking.

I didn't see anything in the sidebar, but what should be lifting structure look like as I'm cutting. I would assume I'm not going to try to progressively overload. I'll be adding in some cardio while I'm cutting to train for a 5k.

,gainit,"Hey guys,

I've been working on my bench press for quite some time now and I'm glad to say that I finally hit 225. I'll outline the process in detail below (video posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG-pPjLWnrQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR037jpPy-n8ypo3RVuYN0SBd8IhhqWOD2mwPzS-St9dY9Bvo179D8G3BQM)).

**Story**

I've been working out on and off since I was 16-17. Usually when school gets busy I take some extended time off, which of course kills a lot of my gains. Fast forward to 19 and I'm in decent shape, but my strength isn't great. So I set out to increase my bench. I started out at around 145, and my process to make gains would be to do 1 rep at each weight in an effort to eventually weigh up each time. Of course this goes against what every experienced lifter will tell you to do, but I found that it worked quite well for me when I was starting out. I would fail multiple days in a row (usually getting increasingly close to making the lift), which would culminate in me finally benching 10lbs more than the previous time, and for roughly 4 months, I rode this all the way to 205lbs. However, I found that that was my breaking point with this flawed training method. Predictably, my shoulders were also very sore, which coincided with school getting more busy. So, I took a 3 month break until September of this year.

When I started again, I had pretty much lost all the progress I made from the months prior, so I could only do 155. I knew that my former workout strategy would wear thin when I got to higher weights, so I decided to change things up a bit and adopt a real routine.

**Routine**

Now, since I started again 3 months ago, I have been doing a program where I do:

\-Workout 1: 80% of my 1RM for 5x5  
\-Workout 2: 85% of my 1RM for 4x4  
\-Workout 3: 90% of my 1RM for 3x3  
\-Workout 4: 95% of my 1RM for 2x2  
\-Workout 5: 100% of my 1RM for 1x1

Within each workout, I start out with 5 pull-ups to warm myself up, 5 reps of 45lbs and 95lbs, then 1 rep of each weight until I get to the weight I'll be working with that day.

I did this every 2 days without exercising in between in order to maintain recovery. The key -- for me at least -- was to be consistent and not skip any workouts because even 1 missed workout would kill my momentum.

**Diet**

I've been keeping a rather consistent diet for the past 4 months. It's a variation of the vertical diet and every meal consists of:

\-Pasta/White rice  
\-Beef/Chicken  
\-1 cup of orange juice  
\-1 cup of almond butter

Before workouts, I have a cup of beet juice and a scoop of honey.

During workouts, I have a cup of orange juice with a scoop of BCAAs.

After workouts, I have a cup of orange juice with a scoop of creatine.

Yes, a lot of orange juice.

**Other Lifts**

My chiropractor advised me not to lift heavy for back squats and deadlifts because I have scoliosis, so I'm playing it safe on that front and just trying to do light weights.

Aside from that, I like to do pull-ups, standing shoulder presses, seated shoulder presses, standing flyes, squats and calf raises. I don't specifically work on core very much because I feel it gets activated in many of the movements I do.

**Future Goals**

The primary reason I've been working out is to increase my strength in other sports such as baseball and football, so I plan to add some weight and try to ride this out as long as I can (hopefully weighing something like 160 and benching 275), then I'll work to maintain that and focus on staying in shape.

If anyone would like to critique my form I'd greatly appreciate that because I feel it's still far from perfect. I also notice that when I really push myself my right arm lags a bit from my left arm (even though I'm right-handed) so if anyone has any tips for that I'd love to hear some!

&lt;p&gt;-Pasta/White rice&lt;br/&gt;
-Beef/Chicken&lt;br/&gt;
-1 cup of orange juice&lt;br/&gt;
-1 cup of almond butter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before workouts, I have a cup of beet juice and a scoop of honey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During workouts, I have a cup of orange juice with a scoop of BCAAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After workouts, I have a cup of orange juice with a scoop of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, a lot of orange juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Lifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My chiropractor advised me not to lift heavy for back squats and deadlifts because I have scoliosis, so I&amp;#39;m playing it safe on that front and just trying to do light weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I like to do pull-ups, standing shoulder presses, seated shoulder presses, standing flyes, squats and calf raises. I don&amp;#39;t specifically work on core very much because I feel it gets activated in many of the movements I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary reason I&amp;#39;ve been working out is to increase my strength in other sports such as baseball and football, so I plan to add some weight and try to ride this out as long as I can (hopefully weighing something like 160 and benching 275), then I&amp;#39;ll work to maintain that and focus on staying in shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone would like to critique my form I&amp;#39;d greatly appreciate that because I feel it&amp;#39;s still far from perfect. I also notice that when I really push myself my right arm lags a bit from my left arm (even though I&amp;#39;m right-handed) so if anyone has any tips for that I&amp;#39;d love to hear some!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if anyone has any questions, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"https://oatsandwheytoday.blogspot.com/2020/12/a-tale-of-two-lifters-bulky-bob-gaining.html

**Lifter 'A', let's call him Bob.** Bob wants to ""bulk"" to build muscle quickly. Bob is probably already too high in fat to begin a massing phase, but he heard about ""newb gains"" in the first year of lifting, so Bob dives in with reckless abandon. He signs up at a local gym, eager to get jacked.

Bob starts with an incorrect TDEE estimation he thinks he can trust, since it came from a TDEE ""calculator"". But it's only an estimate based off of self-reporting of activity level. Bob fancies himself as far more active than he is, though in actuality he will be adding only 3 or 4 days of gym stuff to his otherwise sedentary life. Bob avoids cardio &amp; conditioning work altogether, because he heard it will make building muscle harder. He only wants to do enough lifting to grow, and nothing more. Bob is lucky if he follows any program at all...

What Bob does for the first 6 months is not a proper program, it's just a routine; it's just a list of exercises, and some of them he doesn't bother with. He does the same 3 sets of 10 for a couple lifts, mostly arms; and he doesn't squat at all because he thinks his legs are large enough. His leg size is mostly due to fat, though. Or maybe he squats once or twice per month. Because he wants extra definition. But hitting legs sucks, and is demotivating. He adds a little weight to the bar now and then.

Bob does some flat bench, some light overhead dumbbell work, plenty of bicep curls of course, cable-flyes etc., but no real pulling to speak of. Yes, he does some lat pull-downs, because bodybuilders do them. But Bob cannot do a single pull-up, because he's ""training for size, not strength"", whatever that means. He certainly doesn't deadlift, because Bob heard horror stories about shattered backs &amp; slipped discs. Besides, he doesn't really see the point. Bob is mostly preoccupied with his one-rep max for bench. But he also misses days here and there, worried that he shouldn't train while sore; or let's be honest, he just didn't feel like it.

Bob started out roughly counting calories for a month, but this turned into estimates, and soon gave way to just eating anything and everything he wanted. ""It doesn't matter, I'm bulking!"". If a pound per week is normal, 5 or 6 per month should be okay, maybe even better? He surely doesn't wanna waste those ""newb gains"" he heard about. Bob eats pizza, burgers, anything, everything, but he always remembers to drink a scoop of whey twice per day. Protein will make this happen! He wants to make the most of this Dreamer bulk he's on, and he plugs away at the same minimalist program month after month. Maybe half-way through the year he finally tries to follow an odd program he found somewhere, but Bob doesn't really push himself.

To be fair, Bob did see some real progress in the first month or two, since he was using some of these muscles for the first time. They responded with a little growth, because new lifters will respond to anything. He looked &amp; felt even bigger in the third month, since everything was definitely ""bigger"". He was holding more water overall, but then fat cells started filling up too. Bob kind of fucks around in the gym for about 60 minutes, when his workout routine would take anyone else only 30 minutes to complete, between all his mirror-posing and trips to the water fountain. He is good at tying up equipment.

Bob weighs himself only once every two weeks or so. Six months go by. Eight months. Bob feels huge, and he is. Oh, Bob does not train abs because ""you can't see them, anyways!"" Bob did not even start his bulk with abs, so he had no ""abs"" to lose. He knows ""some"" of the mass in his midsection is fat. Or is it? Is it food? Yes, it is also food, some of it from the day before. But Bob is stoked because of all the ""sick gains"" he's making. He knows he should ""cut"" as some point, to get shredded and reveal all the muscle he thinks he has built. But he still wants to make the most of this first bulk...

A year goes by. Bob has gained 50 pounds; five of them were water, ten pounds (at most) were muscle. Bob has 35 more pounds of fat now. Bob has fucked up his bulk. He is bummed and blames his ""bad genetics"".



**Lifter 'B', let's call him ""Greg"".** Greg also wants to start lifting, and build muscle. He will likewise dedicate his first year of lifting to this task of bulking. Greg has read a little more beforehand, on such topics as training and diet, so he enters this thing a bit more knowledgeable. He has found a good free program online, and he rearranges a few things in his schedule to accommodate lifting 6 days per week.

Yes, he's a full-time student, and also has a part-time job. But he's always been enthralled by a well-developed physique, so he will prioritize this. Sure, some things are on hold. He still has a good social life. Greg wakes up early to lift first thing in the morning. He is fortunate to join a gym that's only a 12-minute bike ride from his home. He eats a snack in transit, squeezes in a full session at the gym in only 43 minutes, rides back, showers, and drinks a meal-replacement shake. Then he properly begins his day.

He'd prefer to not lift so early, but that's what works for Greg at this time. He is mindful to follow his program, increasing weight when prescribed. He hits a different main lift each day in the gym, followed by a supplemental variation of the main lift, and then several accessory movements including opposite muscle groups and some isolation work. Greg is able to super-set the last 3 exercises in the interest of time. In all, it's compact &amp; well-structured. It works well!

All his compound lifts are going up, and he is visibly more muscular after only four months. He started on a decent introductory program which worked well enough, then Greg found a better program with more volume and a greater focus on certain body parts, and greater frequency for his favorite lifts. He was better prepared when he switched to it, since he'd built a base of strength first. He even looks forward to squatting &amp; deadlifting!

How does Greg eat? For the first 2 months he ate only slightly more food, because he was clearly hungrier from the additional effort. But he wanted to get a good baseline approximation of his personal calorie intake, since he was still learning to track calories accurately. Greg invested in a food scale, and a small amount of containers with lids; he settled on 3 or 4 different meals he didn't mind eating regularly. This was in addition to his post-training meal-shakes, and several snacks. He made a point of eating more protein overall, mindful to include green veggies, and healthful fats. Carbs made it easier to hit his calorie targets.

After ironing out the kinks of cooking, meal-prep, and bringing a cooler with food to re-heat while at work etc, Greg also arrived at a good figure for how many calories he now burned in an average day, in response to the amount of activity he now performed. It was only then that he decided to eat in a clear calorie surplus. He settled on +350 calories more than he burned, with the goal of gaining roughly 3 pounds per month.

Greg quickly weighed himself each morning after the bathroom, and recorded the number. This only took him 20 seconds. He would find his average weight each week, to track his rate of change over time. And although he bicycles to the gym in the morning (and to work!), he also added a brisk 1/2 hour walk twice per week, in the interest of minimizing fat gain while bulking. Around 6 or 7 months in, Greg started getting sincere compliments from extended family members (not just, ""my, how you've grown!"", but, ""Wow Greg, you're starting to look jacked!""). Classmates also responded with more attention, and he began to exude confidence.

Every couple of months, he would need to adjust calories slightly, to maintain the same gain over time. He makes it to the end of a year of consistent lifting &amp; disciplined eating. How was Greg's bulk? His scale weight went up a solid 30 pounds! Yes, he probably added 10-12 pounds of fat, but the rest was all lean body mass. And since he started out lean, he still had good definition in his stomach. Abs slightly blurrier, but still there. His arms were more vascular. Greg even had some striations in his chest and shoulders. In all, it was a very reasonable massing phase.

At this point, Greg chooses to cut for 10-12 weeks, in order to trim some of the fluff away. He wants to realize a little more muscular definition before bulking again, yet at a slightly slower rate this time. Bob, however, has not yet started his cut, because he's afraid to ""catabolize"" his hard-earned ""muscle"". Bob is currently an outspoken member of NattyOrJuice, shouting down pictures of guys such as Greg, claiming his physique can't possibly be attained by a natural drug-free lifter in such a short period of time...



The END

*(or is it?)*

**TL;DR:**

Don't eat accidentally or arbitrarily. Have a clear plan of some sort.

Make sure your calorie surplus is justified by your training volume!",t2_17aonk,False,,0,False,"A Tale of Two Lifters: ""Bulky Bob"" &amp; ""Gaining Greg"".",[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_kmg3py,False,dark,0.93,,public,342,3,{},b0a79304-3c50-11e1-b337-12313d18ad57,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,342,,False,,1609450789.0,tier1,[],{'gid_1': 2},,True,,1609283290.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://oatsandwheytoday.blogspot.com/2020/12/a-tale-of-two-lifters-bulky-bob-gaining.html""&gt;https://oatsandwheytoday.blogspot.com/2020/12/a-tale-of-two-lifters-bulky-bob-gaining.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hey everybody.

I've been doing the J&amp;T 2.0 program for 9 months now. I modified it quite a lot, honestly, since I lift at home.

I noticed that while I got bigger, my strength hasn't gone up at all, in particular my bench press. 

&amp;#x200B;

My upper body/chest day is the following:

**Bench press:** 3 sets of X number of reps (depends on the week, but X ranges between 1 and 6, decreasing the rep and increasing the weight week by week).

**Close grip bench:** 4 sets of X number of reps (as above, but higher reps, X starts at 10 and decreases week by week)

**Incline Bench:** 3MRS (reps range from 15 to 6)

**Dips**: 3x3-5 (heavy low-reps) 

&amp;#x200B;

Then some accessory work such as skullcrushers, shrugs etc. 

I read around that when you follow such programs that are hypertrophy focused and you ALSO add more stuff, then it's obvious that you are not going to gain strength.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought of switching to more basic programs such as 5-3-1, but since I've been doing this much volume for like a year I'm afraid of backing off the volume just to gain more strength...won't that make me lose muscle?

,gainit,"Alllrighty, here we are - two years since I started lifting consistently. This is, once again, going to be a fairly long and detailed post. [Here](https://imgur.com/IUr03Gb) is a side by side. Before and After.

Before reading this post. Please consider reading my six and twelve month progress posts before continuing.

[Six Month Progress](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/cftw1f/progress_21m59_6_months_132143150/)

[Twelve Month Progress](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ehd36k/progress_m5921_one_year_of_bulking_128lbs_to/)

# January 2020 - December 2020 : Set Backs

Like most,  had a major impact on my progress this year. I took a break from lifting. March 13th to June 20th, roughly three months. At the start of lockdown I weighed about 156lbs. Come June 20th, my first day back to the gym, I weighed roughly 141lbs. A majority of my weight loss was from muscle. I did lose some fat as well. During that time, I still ate fairly healthy, just a lot less.

**OCD - Medication**

About a year ago, I was clinically diagnosed with OCD. Along with therapy, I was prescribed Paxil. I never took the advice of my physiatrist, mainly due to the side effects of the Paxil and not wanting to spend the money for therapy sessions. Anyway, lockdown plus some other personal issues were extremely hard on me mentally. I felt like I was going insane. So I decided to give the Paxil another shot. I started taking the medication around September - and boy was it rough. The initial side effects took about a month to go away. The first two weeks were brutal - I could not eat. I could not focus. My mind would space out constantly. I felt sick to my stomach every single day. But I still tried my hardest in the gym.

**Injuries**

Thankfully, I have not had many injuries. Barely any in fact. I really only have issues with my right arm. I dislocated my arm and have had tennis elbow a few times. I never stopped lifting during these injuries. Just tweaked my workouts, stretched the injured areas, and took turmeric.

The EASIEST way to prevent any kind of injury is to know your form and know your limits. Form is so critical. Learn it for all the major lifts. Learn what muscles are worked through each phase of the lift. Learn the mechanics. Learn. Proper. Form. I promise you, if you take the time, you will lift more weight efficiently and sustainably.

*Form Resources*

[Stronglifts](https://stronglifts.com/exercises/)

[Alan Thrall](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlanThrall/playlists) (He has playlists for each major lift with lots of good information in them)

The reason why I mention these set backs is to show how that progress is not going to be perfect. As long as you clock in, try your best, and clock out. You will make progress. Whether you are going through physical or mental challenges, get in there and put in your hours. That is as long as you are eating properly.

Programming

I started my first program eight weeks ago. [Powerbuilding II](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/shop/training-templates/powerbuilding-ii-template/) by Barbell Medicine. Since this is a paid program I'm not gonna go into too much detail about program specifics. Its fairly simple program consisting of four lifting days and two cardio type days with one day off. Ill give y'all an example of one of my workout for this week.

**Lifting Day 1**

Squat with belt :

***1 rep @ RPE 8***

***5 reps @ RPE 9***

***5 reps @ RPE 8 (-5%) Repeat until RPE 9 again (cap at 2 sets)***

Incline Bench:

***8 reps @ RPE 7***

***8 reps @ RPE 8***

***8 reps @ RPE 9***

***8 reps @ RPE 8 (-5%) Repeat until RPE 9 again (cap at 2 sets)***

Split Squats :

***10*** ***reps @ RPE 6***

***10 reps @ RPE 7***

***10 reps @ RPE 8***

***10 reps @ RPE 8***

Supplemental Work : Bicycle Squats (program has leg extensions)

***3x 12 reps @ RPE 8***

I definitely like this program. Its simple and doesn't need a lot of equipment to complete. Since I workout at home now it works well for me. I have seen a decent amount of progress in main lifts. Reminder I am just starting week 8 of this 10 week program.

Before - **Squat -** *290lbs;* **Bench -** *215lbs;* **Deadlift -** 365lbs conventional of course **Total -** *870lbs*

After - **Squat -** *325lbs;* **Bench -** *235lbs;* **Deadlift -** *400*lbs conventional of course **Total -** *960lbs*

Almost a 100 pound difference in 8 weeks. Pretty neat.

Home Gym Setup and Equipment

I was lucky enough to build my home gym over the summer. Spent roughly $2000 on the whole setup.

Rack - [RML-3](https://www.roguefitness.com/rml-3-rogue-monster-lite-r-3?prod_id=53481&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA25v_BRBNEiwAZb4-ZecxWoMGwGMgs6naelb7dKHZU55EHrjDKPN-Y9_0hb-FCM4QdwBDMxoCdoIQAvD_BwE)

I built the deadlift platform myself for around $200 in supplies. With help from my cousin, built the plate stand for $80. Would like to add more equipment in the future but for now it works. I am a cheap fuck and my wallet needs a rest.

Two Year Reflection

This is the longest that I have ever stuck to something, consistently. I know that I have made a ton a progress since I started. I love lifting and don't think I will ever stop. At least I hope not. I feel a sense of relief when I am lifting. Just put on some suicideboys and pick up some heavy shit. Sort of an emotional outlet, I guess. I have learned a lot and its crazy to think back at the knowledge I had when I started. I still feel like I learn something new every week. With a lot still to learn. I would consider myself an intermediate lifter at this point.

My goals have certainly changed since I started. I remember I first started lifting to get chicks. Feels cringey now. At this point I could give a shit about how I look. I just want to be strong. I have realized that I have to do stuff for myself. Lifting is something I do for myself.

Plan Moving Forward

After I finish this current program, I plan on running this program again. I like the simplicity of the program and believe I have made decent progress so far. Sooo close to the 1000 pound club. My goal for 2020 was to hit that mark. Without  I would have made it. Oh well. After that I don't know what my goals are gonna be. Maybe I'll learn Olympic lifts after I finish the second round of the program.

Conclusion

Well, that is two whole years in the books. If anyone has a questions feel free to ask. It's been fun. If you are looking to build a home gym and cannot find equipment, check out [r/homegym](https://www.reddit.com/r/homegym/). Thanks for reading, I hope you all like these kinds of progress posts. I'll probably make another one in a year.

This is, once again, going to be a fairly long and detailed post. &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/IUr03Gb""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a side by side. Before and After.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before reading this post. Please consider reading my six and twelve month progress posts before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/cftw1f/progress_21m59_6_months_132143150/""&gt;Six Month Progress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/ehd36k/progress_m5921_one_year_of_bulking_128lbs_to/""&gt;Twelve Month Progress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;January 2020 - December 2020 : Set Backs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most,  had a major impact on my progress this year. I took a break from lifting. March 13th to June 20th, roughly three months. At the start of lockdown I weighed about 156lbs. Come June 20th, my first day back to the gym, I weighed roughly 141lbs. A majority of my weight loss was from muscle. I did lose some fat as well. During that time, I still ate fairly healthy, just a lot less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCD - Medication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I was clinically diagnosed with OCD. Along with therapy, I was prescribed Paxil. I never took the advice of my physiatrist, mainly due to the side effects of the Paxil and not wanting to spend the money for therapy sessions. Anyway, lockdown plus some other personal issues were extremely hard on me mentally. I felt like I was going insane. So I decided to give the Paxil another shot. I started taking the medication around September - and boy was it rough. The initial side effects took about a month to go away. The first two weeks were brutal - I could not eat. I could not focus. My mind would space out constantly. I felt sick to my stomach every single day. But I still tried my hardest in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injuries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I have not had many injuries. Barely any in fact. I really only have issues with my right arm. I dislocated my arm and have had tennis elbow a few times. I never stopped lifting during these injuries. Just tweaked my workouts, stretched the injured areas, and took turmeric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EASIEST way to prevent any kind of injury is to know your form and know your limits. Form is so critical. Learn it for all the major lifts. Learn what muscles are worked through each phase of the lift. Learn the mechanics. Learn. Proper. Form. I promise you, if you take the time, you will lift more weight efficiently and sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Form Resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://stronglifts.com/exercises/""&gt;Stronglifts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/AlanThrall/playlists""&gt;Alan Thrall&lt;/a&gt; (He has playlists for each major lift with lots of good information in them)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I mention these set backs is to show how that progress is not going to be perfect. As long as you clock in, try your best, and clock out. You will make progress. Whether you are going through physical or mental challenges, get in there and put in your hours. That is as long as you are eating properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my first program eight weeks ago. &lt;a href=""https://www.barbellmedicine.com/shop/training-templates/powerbuilding-ii-template/""&gt;Powerbuilding II&lt;/a&gt; by Barbell Medicine. Since this is a paid program I&amp;#39;m not gonna go into too much detail about program specifics. Its fairly simple program consisting of four lifting days and two cardio type days with one day off. Ill give y&amp;#39;all an example of one of my workout for this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifting Day 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squat with belt :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 rep @ RPE 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5 reps @ RPE 9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;5 reps @ RPE 8 (-5%) Repeat until RPE 9 again (cap at 2 sets)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incline Bench:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 reps @ RPE 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 reps @ RPE 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 reps @ RPE 9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 reps @ RPE 8 (-5%) Repeat until RPE 9 again (cap at 2 sets)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Split Squats :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reps @ RPE 6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 reps @ RPE 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 reps @ RPE 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 reps @ RPE 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supplemental Work : Bicycle Squats (program has leg extensions)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;3x 12 reps @ RPE 8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely like this program. Its simple and doesn&amp;#39;t need a lot of equipment to complete. Since I workout at home now it works well for me. I have seen a decent amount of progress in main lifts. Reminder I am just starting week 8 of this 10 week program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before - &lt;strong&gt;Squat -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;290lbs;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bench -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;215lbs;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Deadlift -&lt;/strong&gt; 365lbs conventional of course &lt;strong&gt;Total -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;870lbs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After - &lt;strong&gt;Squat -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;325lbs;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bench -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;235lbs;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Deadlift -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;400&lt;/em&gt;lbs conventional of course &lt;strong&gt;Total -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;960lbs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost a 100 pound difference in 8 weeks. Pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home Gym Setup and Equipment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to build my home gym over the summer. Spent roughly $2000 on the whole setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rack - &lt;a href=""https://www.roguefitness.com/rml-3-rogue-monster-lite-r-3?prod_id=53481&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA25v_BRBNEiwAZb4-ZecxWoMGwGMgs6naelb7dKHZU55EHrjDKPN-Y9_0hb-FCM4QdwBDMxoCdoIQAvD_BwE""&gt;RML-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbell - &lt;a href=""https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-45lb-ohio-power-bar-black-zinc""&gt;Ohio Bar Power Bar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bench - &lt;a href=""https://www.repfitness.com/strength-equipment/strength-training/benches/rep-ab-3100-fi-bench""&gt;REP AB-3100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hello everyone, I started working out around 2.5 months ago and I’ve seen quite some progress in terms of changes in my body but now I feel like I’ve hit a plateau. Compared to the first few weeks, I can’t gain anymore weight or lift any heavier compared to previous weeks (I was able to gradually increase the weight I life almost every week)

My height:5”8
Weight: 62-64 Kgs
Bf% unknown 

My current diet and supplements i take:

I start of the day with a cup of tea and 4 whole eggs with the yolk (fried/boiled)

Followed by lunch, which always includes white rice and some form of meat

Then I hit the gym and once I’m back, I have a chicken leg and thigh piece and 1.5 scoops of whey protein.(350 calories and 45-50g protein)

For dinner, I’ve rice again and some fort of meat

Supplements: I take muscle tech nitro tech whey with 3G creatine and 5g Bcaa per scoop 

Used to take BCAA and preworkout but have stopped since BCAA comes with my current protein and preworkout simply didn’t work for me 

My questions are:
1. Should I start eating more? If so, what should I eat and how much? Ps: I live in india

2. Does masturbation affect your body or your ability to develop muscles or lift weight in any way? It’s kind of an addiction for me. I’ve been trying to abstain but it’s really really hard 

3. I’m fairly lean but have accumulated Some fat on my belly etc due to the amount of junk I had during the lockdown, basically I can see outerlining of the abs under good lighting. Should I start doing cardio as well or should I just focus on bulking?

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does masturbation affect your body or your ability to develop muscles or lift weight in any way? It’s kind of an addiction for me. I’ve been trying to abstain but it’s really really hard &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m fairly lean but have accumulated Some fat on my belly etc due to the amount of junk I had during the lockdown, basically I can see outerlining of the abs under good lighting. Should I start doing cardio as well or should I just focus on bulking? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help is appreciated&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hey guys,

I was just wondering if anyone had tried a very high protein diet and if that yielded better results when bulking in terms of muscle vs fat.

This is because there is at least one or two studies that suggest that overeating on protein may not lead to excess fat gain, which I guess could make bulking cleaner if you hit a certain minimum of calories and just added protein to eat in a surplus. I mean this in terms of trying to minimise fat gains not just simply more protein = more muscle.

Here’s some links about this

,gainit,"So I train pretty heavy on my lifts lately and I was just wondering when and how you should plan a deload. For example, for bench press I usually start my program at rpe 7 or 8 for 5 reps and whenever I hit 4 sets of 5 I add 5 lbs to the lift next workout. I’ll do this for like 2-3 months sometimes  until I plateau but after a while my shoulders start hurting and this sometimes leads to minor injury even. It’s not a form issue, it’s just because I’m benching very heavy twice a week and after a while the stress on the muscle adds up. My shoulders are very tight and I have to warm up and stretch them quite a bit pre and post workout to prevent injury. But for the sake of this post I just wanna know how to plan a deload to give your muscles a break and prepare for the next workout plan regardless of the exercise. 

My main goal is to build muscle rather than build strength so maybe I need to adjust the rep range too. So how do I know when to lower the weight and how should I plan my deload. Do I even need to deload if my main goal is to build muscle? Should I just lower the rpe down back down to 7 or 8 and then repeat the program?

Context: Exactly a year ago I was weighing 54kg. Today, I weigh in at exactly 72kg. I exercised optimally to the best of my abilities. I followed strict routines and strict diets.  [28M]

Training wise, I'm no half repper and I don't sacrifice form for weight. I do things properly and go as hard as I can on every workout. I make every rep count. First few months, I was only hitting my legs once a week. I realized I was going nowhere so I started hitting them twice a week. One strength focused day and one pure hypertrophy day. And I'm still not seeing any results. I don't know if it's in my head and I don't see it, but whenever I check for progress, I feel demotivated. 

I don't understand. I think I'm doing things properly on all aspects. My upper body has seen a development I never thought I'd see. My legs on the other hand... 

And what's making me curious is that despite seeing no definition, I know for a fact I'm getting stronger every week. In fact, my squats are the only compound lift I haven't failed in a whole year of training. I started with the empty bar 20kg and only yesterday I repped 100kg for 10. 

Stats and measurements:

- Height: 1M77, 72kg.
- Bench 1RM &gt; 105kg.
- Deadlift 1RM &gt; 150kg.
- Squat &gt; I'd say 130kg. Haven't maxed out yet

,gainit,"This last year really changed my health and strength, leading to more confidence, and also lessened my anxiety. I started at around 68kg with these 1RMS:

SQUAT: 50KG
BENCH: 40KG ish
DL: 60KG
OHP: 28KG

When I began training I didn't actually know what I was doing. I didn't know that there's high bar and low bar squat.
I didn't know that there's very little difference between conventional and sumo deadlift.

I got knee pain, lower back pain, elbow tendonitis
I've just fixed my elbow pain which was all my squat grip and shelf
Lower back pain is much better after training core exclusively and stretching my hip flexors and paying really good attention to form.

Over the year I have watched so much fitness content and most importantly form/technique. Calgary Barbell, Alan Thrall and Greg Doucette has taught me a lot. 

The program I started on were Stronglifts, but the volume were very squat focused and no progression scheme to follow.
After a few weeks I quickly found out that GZCLP would be much better for me. GZCLP teaches you to program on your own while progressing through rep ranges. It revolved around finding your weakpoints and including accessories that support your main lifts for that day.

Lifts now 3RM:

SQUAT: 130kg
BENCH: 90kg
DL: 155kg
OHP: 55kg

What have I learned?

Food and sleep is so important. There are days when I get 4 hours of sleep and the gym session goes to shit. Also don't be afraid to eat a little bit unhealthy. Just don't overdo it. Chocolate milk is my favorite. Ez 400 calories.

Form is really important. Protect your back, especially your lower back. Strong core and bracing is key

I eat around 3700kcal a day, 170g protein

OHP: 55kg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have I learned?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food and sleep is so important. There are days when I get 4 hours of sleep and the gym session goes to shit. Also don&amp;#39;t be afraid to eat a little bit unhealthy. Just don&amp;#39;t overdo it. Chocolate milk is my favorite. Ez 400 calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Form is really important. Protect your back, especially your lower back. Strong core and bracing is key&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat around 3700kcal a day, 170g protein&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say I&amp;#39;m very happy with my progress and I can&amp;#39;t wait to deadlift 200kg&lt;/p&gt;

So, right now at my current job, I'm basically burning a minimum of 2800 calories. How do I know this? I do not, but that is primarily based on just the amount of steps I take via my google fit app. 

I also lift heavy objects at work, so I'm not too sure how many calories that will add. I'm also 6ft at 160 lbs. 

I just can't seem to get enough ""clean"" food in. I'm getting around 3600 calories a day, counting a cheat meal, but that doesn't seem like it's enough when taking into account the lifting I do after work.

Any tips on some easy foods to add besides a 1000 calorie shake? I guess I could add another shake, but I'm not too sure how that'll impact the amount of food I can take in.

,gainit,"Hey guys been lifting since roughly August.

When I started out my chest and arms grew quite a bit they started filling out some of my shirts and stuff

But I really started tracking in oct.

My weight then was around 165ish

My arms were a little under 12 inches - chest a little under 36 and they eventually grew to those measurements however

I've been tracking. It's now the end of dec and my arms and chest haven't really been growing. Been eating 3k cals a day - and 160-170g of pro. 

I go to the gym 3 times a week. I've been sure to alter reps and volume to work my muscles in new ways and shock them etc. Also have done different exercises just to target the muscle in a new way ( I don't go crazy with that FYI)

Anyways my current weight is roughly 180lbs and I can say I have gotten significantly stronger! But unfortunately my chest and arms won't grow now for some reason.

Do I need to eat more calories or am I being impatient? I have tracked my weight the last 2 weeks and it hasn't gone up at all. (It may have been at this weight for a week or two more as well)

I heard a rule of thumb is about 2lbs of muscle and 2lbs of fat a month but I'm curious since it seems I have stopped growing in my chest/arms.

Any suggestions?

,gainit,"Hello Once Again Gainers,

**INTRO**

From my time on r/gainit, I've seen many a trainee bemoan being ""skinny-fat"", particularly because they don't know WHAT they should do to address their situation.  If they bulk, they get fatter.  If they cut, they get skinnier.  What are they to do?

I figured I'd share 3 different approaches to address the problem, such that a trainee can pick A way forward and execute it.  A plan, executed violently today, is far better than a superior plan that never gets executed.

Without further ado...

**THE STARTING STRENGTH APPROACH**

This approach is for those that like the idea of beginner and intermediate programs, linear progression, few movements, and low reps.

[Article 1: ""The Skinny Fat Lifter](https://startingstrength.com/training/the-skinny-fat-lifter)

[Article 2: ""The Skinny Fat Lifter 2](https://startingstrength.com/training/the-skinny-fat-lifter-part-2)

KEY POINTS

* If you make your shoulders, traps, chest and upperback wider than your waist, you will no longer appear ""skinny fat"". 

* Growth happens by eating.  Eat to support growth as a new trainee and add some muscle.

* Once your waistline reaches a threshold (say 38-40"") switch to an intermediate program and lose fat until you get your waist under control.  Once you get it under control, go right back to beginner programs and start it over again.  NOTE: Your pants size is NOT your waist size.  Get a measuring tape.

* Focus on driving up your press, chins, pulldowns and deadlift to build up a strong looking upper body.


**2 APPROACHES FROM PAUL CARTER**

This approach is for people that have some meaningful way of measuring their bodyfat.  If the way you measure bodyfat is by taking a random shirtless photo of yourself and posting it online for strangers to take guesses, this is NOT an ideal approach for you.  This is also for trainees that use more variety in their lifting.

[The Article: ""The Bulking and Cutting Handbook""](https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/the-bulking-and-cutting-handbook)

TAKEAWAYS

* ""If you're a total newbie (or have less than a year of really intelligent training experience) and you're more than 18-20% body fat, then you're in luck. No really, you are. Because then you're in that rare period of time where you can lose fat while building a decent amount of muscle at the same time. Get into a minor caloric deficit and focus on banging out rep PR's on the big lifts.""

* ""If you're skinny-fat but in the 12-15% body fat range, then focus on eating a maintenance intake of calories or a very slight surplus, and then bang out the rep PR's.""

* ""The common denominator? Getting stronger in the growth-producing rep ranges (8-20), and putting on more muscle. The underlying problem with looking skinny-fat really isn't the degree of body fat. It's the lack of muscle underneath it.""

* For a solid way to get the growth Paul is talking about, check out the [8-12-8 method](https://www.t-nation.com/training/tip-the-8-12-8-method)

**CONCLUSION**

 There you go: 3 approaches.  You can up calories, linearly progress until you can't, switch to weekly progression while you cut calories and start the whole thing over again.  OR you can run a slight calorie deficit and focus on progressing until you no longer can, at which point you'll be leaner and in a position to add calories and chase PRs.  OR you can add calories and chase rep PRs.  It all works!

,gainit,"18M 143 pounds 5’8” on my first lean bulk. Gone from around 2000 to 2600 calories per day over the last month. Over the last week I upped my intake from 2400-2600 and my weight has rapidly increased by around 4-5 pounds over the last 2 days. Most of the added intake has come from solely from carbs. Body fat % has also gone up based on a scale I have and abs are less visible. I’ve also been feeling sluggish. The weird thing is that i’ve noticed greater vascularity even with the higher bodyfat. It’s been pretty tough to eat the full 2600 each day from clean foods - not sure if that means I should cut back. What are some explanations for this? Should I cut back calories a bit to slow weight gain a bit? Also if I wanted to stay leaner is there a way I can cut every few weeks without losing muscle mass?

,gainit,"Hey everyone! I'm still early in my journey but I've learned a lot from this sub and want to give something back so here it goes.

Backstory: 
I'm about 5'6 and fluctuate between 143-147 lbs per month. It was quite a time getting here because I started around 110, skinny! I just want to fit in my t-shirts better :). Even getting here and finding motivation to eat correctly was difficult as I enjoy snacking and in particular, unhealthy snacking. 

 I've kept a list of some substitutes that worked for me and I plan to make these healthier over time. Personally I don't relate to the ""I woke up one day and started eating healthy"" stories, I found habits are a more resilient practice to keep yourself in check.  So I started with improving my grocery list.


Swaps:
Ice cream - get some greek yogurt of your favorite flavor (vanilla with your own toppings is good too) then mix that with some granola and/or berries. High protein dairy that has natural sugars to curb the sweet tooth. The granola gets some good carbs in as well.

Beer - this is a hard one but kombucha. Though not the healthiest of drinks I found that the ""kick back with a beer"" feeling was nicely replaced with one of these. Mio is another great option, I find mostly what I want is something that isn't water when I'm relaxing at the end of the day. The consideration for this is one serving of sugar vs alcohol, lesser of two evils approach. 

Chips - popcorn. Microwavable makes it easier to to avoid the impulses if you have some chips in your pantry. Stovetop is unbeatable though. You can even season the popcorn with the same spices as your favorite chips! Just make sure to get the unbuttered options if you're worried about fats.  Peanut butter pretzels are also great if you're trying to easily boost that protein count. I find downing an extra 20gs of protein is super easy this way. Also chickpeas are straight fire, fairly expensive unfortunately but they carry the same flavors as most chips.

Ground beef - I love ground beef but unfortunately it's not great to have it every day. Consuming large amounts of red meat increases risk of heart disease and I'm trying to run a marathon here, not a sprint. Ground turkey can be dropped in if you find you're eating too much. I've replaced most of my meals with chicken / turkey and ~ 3 days a week have a meal with beef or a red meat. It keeps me looking for to those days and keep on track.



These were the things that I would find myself craving  every night when I'm bored watching Netflix or gaming. Quarantine has made these impulses even worse. The replacements are just a step forward towards a better diet and some I still want to phase out (kombucha). Hopefully this helps someone improve their shopping list or make gaining look feasible and enjoyable. Drop what replacements you like!

,gainit,"This subreddit has been invaluable to me and I've learned a lot. I would like input from the community on if a program switch is right for me in the new year.

**My Background:** 

38 years old, 5'9"", male. I've been taking gaining serious for 7 months. Prior to that I lived an entirely sedentary lifestyle. I've gone from 137lb to 164lb, and my bio-scale suggests 13lbs of that weight gain has been muscle. My lifts are up considerably. I've been running a version of the Reddit PPL for the entire 7 months, with focus on major compound lifts (Squat, Deadlift, Bench Press, Overhead Press, Barbell Rows). I work out 4-5 times per week. I'm still making pretty good linear progress every workout (i.e., adding another rep or weight to each exercise).

**My Headspace:** 

I feel OK about my progress, but not great. My friends and family have made comments about how good I am looking, but when I look in the mirror I mostly just see a filled-out version of skinny-me. I recognize 1.9lb of muscle gain a month is pretty good, but I wonder if my newbie gains couldn't be stretched farther. When I see some of the progress pictures on this subreddit I feel like I must be missing something. So many dudes with similar stats to me wind up looking like f'ing He-Man in a similar timeframe. My primary goal is to look good naked (e.g., hypertrophy).

**My Question(s):** 

Should I switch up my program? Is only hitting each PPL muscle group once+ per week limiting me? My thesis is that switching to something that hits my muscle groups more frequently throughout the week will accelerate my progress. I was considering switching to GZCLP, Starting Strength 5x5 or maybe 5/3/1.

I'd love input from you guys if you think this is a good idea. If so, would you recommend one of the above programs (or some other system) above another?

My biggest worry is that I've spent so much time just obliterating my muscle group on a given PPL day that switching to the comparatively ""light"" intensity of one the above programs won't effectively stress a given muscle group.

Even though everyone one weighs the same on a scale there is no way all these different physiques will have the same body composition; some will have more muscle, some will have more fat, some with higher bone density, some with less, etc. Now I’m thinking due to these differences muscle protein synthesis will most likely happen at different rates and at different scales also (if you don’t have much muscle to damage in the first place then it will most likely not take much protein to repair right?).

My diet right now is:

Breakfast - 150g oats with 0.5L Milk and a banana

Snacks - pear/apple, protein brownie /protein bar

Lunch - some kind of meat with few slices of bread and salad

Dinner - i go for a cashew or something like that and whatever my family cooks for a dinner

Tbh I just stared my journey and I'm underweight 184/6.1 and 61kg. I really enjoy eating systematically and doing exercises. But my stomach isn't liking the food... 😐 Is it possible my problem to be coming from the uprise in calories.

My latest routine was Average to Savage 2.0 / Stronger by Science. Highly recommend it for someone coming from a SL5x5 or Starting Strength type program. 

It has been a long, long road. But it doesn't make it any less wonderful.

**Background:**

Been a tall twig my whole life, and decided in November 2019 that this needed to change. I had been dealing with clinical depression for an extended period of time, in and out of hospital and just wasn't happy with myself. Also living in China for a year and people pointing ""so tall and skinny"" all the time did not help! Whilst I was studying in Hong Kong I started casual weightlifting in November 2019, but not eating, decided I enjoyed it so when I returned to the UK December 2019 I decided to get on a PPL programme which I've stuck to ever since, with some adjustments. I have had to deal with 2+ months of lockdown which have eliminated some of the gains I could have made but I made sure to do some bodyweight exercises.

I am dealing with a rotator cuff injury which I picked up at a gym in Seoul back in March as I didn't warm properly (didn't know how to, I've been making this stuff up as I go along), and its bothered me ever since, currently in physio but it meant no benching for at least 3 months and even now I cannot push it without pain (urgh).

**Diet:**

For most of my life I would skip breakfast and go hungry because I saw eating as a waste of time when I could have been studying or doing fun stuff. This changed, I knew I had to eat a lot, how much? I don't know, I just ate anything and everything I could, at one point up to 1kg of chicken breast a day (you could buy 10kg in South Korea for less than $35). I was also drinking ON Gainer. I bought a blender a few months ago and make myself a 2k calorie shake every day, full of whole milk, Greek yoghurt, whey, granola, banana etc.

My BF % is probably too high, I have a bit of a stomach, but at this point I'm going for strength and size so I am not too bothered.

I take creatine powder on and off since May.

**Benefits:**

Feel so much more confident in myself, my rotator cuff hurts almost constantly but I can still workout, and hopefully physio will sort it. I've grown out of many of my clothes and friends are noticing me. gym has been a huge help for my mental health as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Workout (if I don't know the name of it I just make it up):**

Pull:

·  Deadlift.

·  Barbell row.

·  Dumbbell shrug.

·  Bending over 1 hand elbow raise.

·  Preacher curl.

·  Reverse ez bar curl.

·  Lat pull down.

Push:

·  Bench press.

·  Incline dumbbell.

·  OHP.

·  Tricep pull down.

·  Lateral raises.

·  Cable chest press.

Legs:

·  Squats.

·  Leg press.

·  Calf press.

·  Hamstring curl.

·  Hip abduction.

·  Hip adduction.

Lift progress – I tend to avoid 1RM because the opportunity cost is too high:

·  Bench (my weakest because of injury): Start: c.35kg (77lb) for a few reps to 80kg (176lb) 2x3.

·  Squat: Start: c.40kg (88lb) for a few reps to 120kg 1x2 – bellow parallel (264lb).

·  Deadlift: Start: 50kg (110lb) (4x5) to 180kg (397lb) (max – attached the video).

**Background:**

Since 2013 I was trying to gain weight but never really committed to it.

From September 2019 till December 2019 I followed Ivysaur's 4-4-8 and gained like 5 kilos. I lost all of it during the lockdown of March 2020 to July 2020. I started again on the 1st of July with Ivysaur 4-4-8. Made decent gains but felt like I could step it up and started the reddit PPL on the 1st of September 2020. I kinda wanted to post a picture after 6 months to motivate others, since I got most motivation from the posts that showed short-term progress as well instead of the ones that took several years.

**Diet:**

I kinda stuck to eating what I normally did as well, but added 3 extra meals. Looks something like this

Breakfast: Cereal with milk

Lunch: Sandwiches

Snack: Cashewnuts (75 gram) with some chocolate

Dinner: Pasta/Curry/Rice/Potatoes/Junk food with quark and kiwi as dessert

Late night snack: 1100 Kcal shake or 500 kcal shake (depends on time and how much I ate during the day)

Total: Somewhere around 3000 kcal a day

Only supplement I use is whey protein powder. Started creatine at the start but got paranoid that I was losing hair so I stopped taking it haha

**Workout:**

As I stated in the background info, I started Ivysaur 4-4-8 on the 1st of July and switched to the reddit PPL in September. Have been running that since and loving it. Weight progress:

Bench: From 5x5 30 kg (66 lbs) to 5x5 50 kg (110 lbs)

OHP: From 5x5 20 kg (44 lbs) to 5x5 32.5 kg (72 lbs)

Deadlift: From 1x5 40 kg (71 lbs) to 1x5 75 kg (165 lbs)

Squat: From 3x5 40 kg (88 lbs) to 3x5 70 kg (154 lbs)

,gainit,"Hello once again Gainers,

I've seen an issue in the discussion of gaining that I feel may need it's own topic.  Often, whenever a trainee here posts that they gained some amount of weight, someone will immediately chime in and explain that this person is gaining too fast based off some metric on how much muscle a person can put on in a fixed amount of time.  I think the currently en vogue statement is that you can only gain 2lbs of muscle in a month, so let's use that for now.

Trainee says ""I gained 6lbs this month"".  Helpful poster Johnny says ""You're gaining too fast!  You can only gain 2lbs of muscle in a month, so that means you gained 4lbs of fat!  Slow down the bulk!""


Folks, there is more to gaining than fat and muscle.  We're talking SCALE weight here.  Lots of things can impact that.  The top 3 (outside of muscle and fat) being glycogen, water and food mass.


**ON GLYCOGEN**

I'm not nearly equipped to discuss the finer details of glycogen, but [here](https://www.t-nation.com/training/question-of-strength-61) is an article discussing the LOSS of glycogen during weight loss and it's impact on the physique.  

&gt;You might FEEL like you're losing muscle. You might look smaller or deflated, but that comes from storing less glycogen and water inside your muscles. Glycogen is how your body stores carbs inside the muscles; it's a combination of glucose (broken down carbs) and water.  If you're cutting calories (and likely carbs) you'll store less glycogen. Why? Because you don't have ""extra energy"" to store since you're pretty much using it all.  If you store less glycogen and water, your muscles become flatter and smaller looking. A muscle with less glycogen/water is like a balloon with less air. That can mess with your mind, but it's not muscle loss.


In turn, when we're reversing the process and GAINING muscle, with it comes fuller stores of glycogen, which will add more weight to the body.  This is ESPECIALLY true during the initial stages of weight gain.  The first month or so one can see dramatic increases in weight, much like how one can drop weight dramatically in the first few weeks of weight loss.  If anyone has ever watched ""The Biggest Loser"", contestant would like 20lbs in the first week, only to lose little or even GAIN some weight in the second week once glycogen was depleted and they were focusing on ""real"" weight loss.

**ON WATER**

Glycogen pulls in water as well, which is another area where scale weight can be impacted.  On top of that, protein is the macronutrient that requires the MOST water to digest.  This is why most survival kits tend to base their nutrition around fats and carbs with only the barest amounts of protein to ensure survival: if you try going carnivore out in the wild with limited water, you're in for a rough time.  It's also why high protein diets can be of concern for people with kidney disorders.  All of that having been said, if you're taking in more water and HOLDING more water, your scale weight is going to be up FROM MORE WATER.  Water is not fat or muscle, but will impact your scale weight.


**ON FOOD MASS**

And then, there is just plain old food mass.  If you're eating more food, more food is going to be in your body when you weigh yourself.  Yes, even if you weigh yourself consistently everyday after a morning bowel movement, no human completely eliminates everything in their intestines, and the trainee making a concentrated effort to gain weight will have more food in their body compared to a trainee losing weight.


**ON ""GETTING FAT""**

All of this is written to say that you cannot just subtract muscle gain from weight gain and arrive at fat gain.  It's more complex than that.  And as [this](https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/oh-go-ahead-and-pig-out) article points out, it takes an honest concentrated effort to put on a significant amount of fat.  Getting big takes time, no matter if it's big fat or big muscle.  No one is going to balloon up in the span of a month.


So what's the takeaway?  Don't let scale weight gains trip you up.  Always remember: food is there to help you recover from TRAINING.  Train hard enough that you NEED more food to recover, then eat that food, recover and grow.",t2_amc6s,False,,0,False,There Is More To Gaining Than Fat And Muscle,[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_kcaozo,False,dark,0.97,,public,471,6,{},33b63380-7aa9-11e2-8f04-12313d183eb5,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,471,,True,,False,blue,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1607895304.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello once again Gainers,&lt;/p&gt;

This is why most survival kits tend to base their nutrition around fats and carbs with only the barest amounts of protein to ensure survival: if you try going carnivore out in the wild with limited water, you&amp;#39;re in for a rough time.  It&amp;#39;s also why high protein diets can be of concern for people with kidney disorders.  All of that having been said, if you&amp;#39;re taking in more water and HOLDING more water, your scale weight is going to be up FROM MORE WATER.  Water is not fat or muscle, but will impact your scale weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ON FOOD MASS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, there is just plain old food mass.  If you&amp;#39;re eating more food, more food is going to be in your body when you weigh yourself.  Yes, even if you weigh yourself consistently everyday after a morning bowel movement, no human completely eliminates everything in their intestines, and the trainee making a concentrated effort to gain weight will have more food in their body compared to a trainee losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ON &amp;quot;GETTING FAT&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is written to say that you cannot just subtract muscle gain from weight gain and arrive at fat gain.  It&amp;#39;s more complex than that.  And as &lt;a href=""https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/oh-go-ahead-and-pig-out""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article points out, it takes an honest concentrated effort to put on a significant amount of fat.  Getting big takes time, no matter if it&amp;#39;s big fat or big muscle.  No one is going to balloon up in the span of a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s the takeaway?  Don&amp;#39;t let scale weight gains trip you up.  Always remember: food is there to help you recover from TRAINING.  Train hard enough that you NEED more food to recover, then eat that food, recover and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hi all, 

Just wanted to pop in with a little update. The last seven years have been a wild ride. I'm naturally very lean and putting on muscle has been a huge battle. Especially doing it all naturally. I set a goal five years ago to hit 250lbs lean by the time I turned 30. I turn 30 in a week and unfortunately I will come up a few pounds short... BUT that's okay! 

**Pictures** 

[Progress Photos](https://imgur.com/a/8msT6lZ)

I blacked my face out on the early ones because wow... not a great starting look haha. 

**Process and Mistakes** 

Looking back now I can see how many hard lessons I had to learn. I was so desperate to put on weight that I WAY over did it in the first year and got really really fat. Not just fat... skinny fat. 

Believe it or not I weigh the same now (blue shorts photo) as I did in the ""fat"" photo! Talk about a difference in body composition.

I certainly could have made this transformation smarter and faster.... but to be honest, I always tried to keep normal life in mind. I didn't want to let the gym consume my life. I wanted to still enjoy eating and drinking beers with the lads. So it's been something I've embraced as a slow and steady approach and I credit that for making my goals more sustainable and approachable. 

**Core Lifts**

The foundation of everything has pretty much been centered around big compound lifts. My current bests are:

Deadlift: 350lbs x1

Bench Press : 205lbs x2

Overhead Shoulder Press: 135lbs x4

Bentover Row: 155lb x8

**Future Goals**

Being 6'7"" was always something I hated. Now, I am much more comfortable in my own skin. It's taken seven years but I finally feel like I have ""filled out"" my massive frame. 

My next goal is to build on this and spend the next five years building a truly athletic physique. I'm hoping I can hit 270lbs at a lean bf% by the age of 35!

,gainit,"Been working out for 8 weeks now, I've recouped a lot if not most of the former size I cultivated my freshman year of college that I allowed to be recycled back into the temple of brodin.

I've seen 4 inches of growth to my chest, 3 inches to my shoulders, ~1.5 inches to my arms, .75 to my neck and a lot of seemingly unreasonable growth for such a short time span (including a well deserved 1"" of belly fat) on my dreamer bulk for 8 weeks.

However, my forearms have grown perhaps .4 -.45"". In order to bring these numbers up I am starting what I call

**the Dead Hangs Every Day Challenge**

The purpose of this is to introduce a small opportunity every day to get growth on my forearms by doing only dead hangs (which I'm supposed to do after every workout but I'm just too tired/sore/pressed for time).

The goal is a 5 minute window of my day every day to just hang from my home gym's pull up bar, for at least 90 seconds average between sets. As my forearms increase in strength I will attempt to hang for as long as possible up to the 5 minutes as well as stick a dumbell between my feet to increase in intensity every week.


This is a super simple thing to do that even if you don't have a cage rack like me, getting a pullup bar from amazon and just hanging to relieve stress between work is good.

In one week you will have accumulated an extra 35 minute workout that you won't even notice.

WEIGHT:

Dropped from 69kg to 62kg but as of today I’m back up to 68.4kg

Bench PR was 97.5kg at my peak . Managed a shaky 90kg last week .Not gonna mention squat or deadlifts since I’m not doing them.

,gainit,"I have a goal of 190-195 lbs (200 would be a dream) and am currently sitting at 185. 

Recently I had a PT test that I cut TOO close because I neglected cardio. It was a measly 1.5 mile run. Thought because it was a short distance, I could push it out. I was wrong. 

I’ve since done a 3 day workout PPL with 5 days of running/week.

Tuesday: Sprints
Wednesday: Pull day/ 3 mile run
Thursday: Rest
Friday: Legs/easy 3 mile run
Saturday: Long Distance timed run (1 hour) 
Sunday: Rest

After doing this and getting a Body Scan (1 month total time difference) I’ve actually gained .9 lbs but lost muscle mass in all parts (Arms, Trunk, and Legs). This is also odd considering I’ve kept my caloric intake equal despite the upped cardio.

,gainit,"Does anyone have an enjoyable way of eating 4000+ calories healthily? 

Recently Iv gotten a job in a warehouse where Il be walking anywhere between 15-20 miles a shift and I’m not gaining weight unless I’m eating about 4300 calories.

,gainit,"Realised this morning marks 6 months since I started really trying to gain weight so I did some reflection and am pretty happy with the progress that I have made so far. Thought i'd chuck it up here as a place to get some feedback and maybe give some people in similar situations a realistic goal?

**Pictures**

[Here are my comparison pictures, tried to recreate them as closely as possible, right after waking up, not flexed](https://imgur.com/a/3CCgzWi)

Should have taken starting leg pics -.-, but i'm pretty happy with this side by side, very obvious progress when you start out about as thin as you can be. Still underweight, but still gaining.

**The Exercises/Routines**

Started 6 months ago with Phraks GSLP,  my first week lifts were:

Deadlift 1x5@30kg

Squat 3x5@20kg

OHP 3x5@16kg

Bench 3x5@20kg

And these were a huge struggle, the doms left me crippled for week 2.

I spent 3 months on this program before deciding that I might as well go more than 3x a week as I spent my days off itching to go.


After looking for a routine that allowed me to go more times a week I settled on the metallicadpa PPL from /r/fitness wiki. I ran this for 6 weeks and was enjoying it, really started to focus on form for each lifts as I was starting to get more comfortable so my aim was no longer to just do the lift safely, but also to generate as much power as I can with current strength level.

Felt like pushing myself some more and nsuns caught my eye, so I spent from then until now on nsuns (about 6 weeks).

Current best lifts on Nsuns:

[Deadlift 4x87.5kg](http://streamable.com/rbqttg)

Squat 3x72.5kg - Didnt record this but [heres my first time hitting 70kg a couple weeks back](https://streamable.com/xywp2p), night and day comparison to when i [first hit 50kg on 31/7/20](https://streamable.com/ukitpl) and was proud of it til I filmed it and saw my form/depth was shit, dropped it 15kg and worked back up with better form.

OHP 3x42.5kg

Bench 3x52.5kg

Havn't filmed these two as much as my OHP has consistently progressed well and has felt fine so haven't really attempted to analyse my form, and bench is just awkward to film sometimes as only really good spot to put phone is on the other benches which are often occupied.

Bench feels like its lagging a bit, am currently planning on focusing on that heavily now like I have done for squat/deadlift form to figure out where i'm missing power if it's technique or training or what.

**The Future**

Nsuns kicked my ass, which is what I wanted when I chose it, I'm pretty happy with where I am right now and what I got out of it, my current plan is to shift to a submaximal training format for a bit as the forced linear progression on nsuns has made some days daunting (most likely a 5/3/1, probably will start some cycles of 5314B and then i'm considering really going for size and doing the [6 month block laid out here](https://old.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/j5q2ez/6_months_of_eating_and_training_for_mass_laid_out/) by /u/mythicalstrength while taking diet more seriously)

Current measurable goals are a 2x bw squat+deadlift, I'd also love to hit a bodyweight ohp while im reasonably lean, and i'd like to eventually rip an old shirt (but who doesn't?), the rest is just general strength+size increase I don't really have an end goal.

**Diet**

When I started I focused hard on just eating as much as possible, always had struggled with appetite like many others here, I started at the gym between semesters at uni so I had a few weeks break where I could purely focus on eating and working out, and thats what I did. If I could eat more, I did, it was a miserable bloated and nauseated few weeks but it kick started my appetite.

Spent some time counting calories but it really just wasn't for me, I realised if I had to keep so strict on myself I would burn out. The time spent counting gave me a rough idea of how much food I needed to eat to gain and what good recovery/growth felt like, so I just tried to base it on that while tracking my weight daily. If I was hitting my protein count and both my weight and lifts were going up I was happy, at my starting weight the idea of putting on some fat obviously did not scare me at all.

As far as what I ate goes, old me ate twice a day, and one of those meals would be something like instant noodles, with a bit of thought it wasn't too hard to improve. My start was to just swap foods out for better foods and try eat more of them, greek yoghurt instead of noodles, snacking on nuts, making sure I ate when I woke up instead of waiting 6 hours, eating when I COULD rather than when I NEEDED to. Feels like more of a mindset shift than actual diet. Just started to be more conscious of what kind of macros were in different foods and kept them in mind.

Whey protein once a day w/milk, greek yoghurt, nuts, nut bars, proper meal for dinner such as the classic chicken+rice, eating right before going to sleep, maybe a little too much reliance on easy junk calories such as a snickers bar or pizza. These changes were so drastically different from what I was previously doing, that making them just made me start rapidly putting on weight so I didn't put too much more thought into diet. If my weight/strength wasnt stalling and I was recovering adequately, i'm happy with what i'm doing. 

Met my (rough idea of) calorie count and protein count (0.8g/lb minimum, was more like 1.5g/lb most days - not hard to hit this protein count when you're ~100lb, protein shake alone is about half that) and try eat some variety  was all I considered.

* 31 M, 6'1"" \~180 lbs (186 cm 82 kg). Current body comp @ 13% body fat.
* Lifting for \~6 years
* Plateau'd on horizontal press and squats around 205 and 270 respectively (before 03/2020)
* Primarily interested in functional strength with subsidiary aesthetic goals.

**Problem:**

Was doing home workouts from March until September, with a cut so I was down to 170 @ 9% BF. Gyms opened back up so I decided to do a bulk through the end of the year. Started a very rudimentary six-week PPL routine for six-days a week to get back into heavier lifting. Made good progress, got back up to 280 deadlifts and 200 horizontal press, but was lacking on squats (I think because I've been biking a ton and it's exhausting my quads more?)

Gyms are mostly closed back down now. I have access to an outdoor facility (for who knows how long). Reservations are required and only last an hour. I can probably scrape out a bit more than an hour since I work at the gym, but making a reservation is tight since there's easily several thousand members trying to find time and only about 120 slots an hour for about 14 hours a day.

* I'm used to doing a split and hitting every muscle group twice a week for both strength and growth. 
* I'm used to a minimal diet and keeping a relatively low body fat % (between 8 and 10). 
* I think some of my plateaus are purely mental (I'm definitely very afraid of injury). 
* I'm pretty sure I can only reliably get between 3 and 4 reservations a week.
* I have to bike to the gym.

**Possibilities**:

I'm trying to consider what I can do for the next few months that will have earnest payoff. I'm nervous about bulking because the body dysphoria is pretty severe since my lifting journey started with a 100 lb loss. My inclination is to try something like GVL (German Volume Lifting) since it's an every other day routine, but I wonder about doing full-body stuff every other day instead? I'm also wondering what impact the biking is going to have on my ability to push my leg lifts, and how I can circumvent any ""'downsides"" to that if they exist at all.

I&amp;#39;m also wondering what impact the biking is going to have on my ability to push my leg lifts, and how I can circumvent any &amp;quot;&amp;#39;downsides&amp;quot; to that if they exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are y&amp;#39;alls thoughts on full-body versus something like GVL (or supplementing offdays with home workouts)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and helping, I really appreciate all the support and effort in this sub.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"This is my first post here and I think this is within the rules, but I am open to being corrected!

I wanted to make a post to encourage anyone else who is starting to lift and talk about my 10-month progress. I started lifting the first week of February and have been lucky enough to still have weights to lift during gym closures. Unfortunately, I do not have progress pics. It is enough that people have noticed I've been working out though.

**Height/Weight/Age**

Height: 5'11"" (Unchanged)

Weight: 145lbs to 161lbs

Age: 17 to 18

**Progress on B/S/D**

Bench - 115x5 to 210x1/180x6

Squat - 135x5 to 245x5

Deadlift - 185x5 to 280x5

**Weightlifting**

For me, 5x5 has easily been the most effective set/rep scheme for the big three lifts. I have tried 3x8 and some other high rep sets and nothing seems to work as well as sets of 5 heavy reps.  I have no doubt that higher reps work for some people, but 5x5 has worked well for me.

My week has been split into 4 days for the past few months. Days 1 and 3 are Chest/Shoulders/Tris and have flat barbell bench press (5x5) as the main movement. I then add dumbbell shoulder press (4x8), incline dumbbell press (3x8), lateral raises/reverse flyes (3x12), and cable flyes/tricep pushdowns (3x12). I cannot overemphasize the large benefits that tricep pushdowns have seemed to have for my bench press. Days 2 and 4 are Legs/Back/Biceps. Day 2 has the barbell back squat (5x5) as the main movement. It is followed by pendlay row (4x8), single-leg romanian deadlifts (3x12), lat pulldowns (3x12), and standing calf raise (3x15). Day 4 has the barbell deadlift (5x5) as the main movement. It is followed by one arm bent over dumbbell rows (4x8), bulgarian split squats (3x12), and bicep curls (3x12). I do pull-ups throughout every day, so I don't include them in the gym workouts. Do not neglect your back and legs! I know everyone wants bigger pecs and a nice bench, but you can't do it without a strong back and legs. 

**Nutrition**

I have made sure to get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day and then I just let the other macros fall wherever they fall. I have been eating 3300 to 3500 calories per day. I have found that cooking my own food I the best way to have controllable and steady progress.  I normally make eggs and have greek yogurt for breakfast every day and some sort of meat with rice/protein pasta for lunch on weekdays. My mom cooks dinner so that is different every night. I eat out on the weekends, but I am careful to eat healthy foods with good macros. Peanut butter has been one of the best tools for gaining weight in my experience. It has plenty of calories and is very easy to eat. I have one scoop of protein powder most days to help reach my goal.

**Conclusion**

Progress in the weight room can increase your confidence greatly. Don't let it be the only reason you're more confident of course. You simply have to eat, even when you don't want to if you want to gain weight. All of the muscles in your body work together in some way. Your squat can help you bench even though they train different parts of the body. Lifting weights is really simple for beginners like me. All you need to do is lift some heavy weight and you'll see progress.

&lt;p&gt;Bench - 115x5 to 210x1/180x6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squat - 135x5 to 245x5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadlift - 185x5 to 280x5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weightlifting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, 5x5 has easily been the most effective set/rep scheme for the big three lifts. I have tried 3x8 and some other high rep sets and nothing seems to work as well as sets of 5 heavy reps.  I have no doubt that higher reps work for some people, but 5x5 has worked well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My week has been split into 4 days for the past few months. Days 1 and 3 are Chest/Shoulders/Tris and have flat barbell bench press (5x5) as the main movement. I then add dumbbell shoulder press (4x8), incline dumbbell press (3x8), lateral raises/reverse flyes (3x12), and cable flyes/tricep pushdowns (3x12). I cannot overemphasize the large benefits that tricep pushdowns have seemed to have for my bench press. Days 2 and 4 are Legs/Back/Biceps. Day 2 has the barbell back squat (5x5) as the main movement. It is followed by pendlay row (4x8), single-leg romanian deadlifts (3x12), lat pulldowns (3x12), and standing calf raise (3x15). Day 4 has the barbell deadlift (5x5) as the main movement. It is followed by one arm bent over dumbbell rows (4x8), bulgarian split squats (3x12), and bicep curls (3x12). I do pull-ups throughout every day, so I don&amp;#39;t include them in the gym workouts. Do not neglect your back and legs! I know everyone wants bigger pecs and a nice bench, but you can&amp;#39;t do it without a strong back and legs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made sure to get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day and then I just let the other macros fall wherever they fall. I have been eating 3300 to 3500 calories per day. I have found that cooking my own food I the best way to have controllable and steady progress.  I normally make eggs and have greek yogurt for breakfast every day and some sort of meat with rice/protein pasta for lunch on weekdays. My mom cooks dinner so that is different every night. I eat out on the weekends, but I am careful to eat healthy foods with good macros. Peanut butter has been one of the best tools for gaining weight in my experience. It has plenty of calories and is very easy to eat. I have one scoop of protein powder most days to help reach my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress in the weight room can increase your confidence greatly. Don&amp;#39;t let it be the only reason you&amp;#39;re more confident of course. You simply have to eat, even when you don&amp;#39;t want to if you want to gain weight. All of the muscles in your body work together in some way. Your squat can help you bench even though they train different parts of the body. Lifting weights is really simple for beginners like me. All you need to do is lift some heavy weight and you&amp;#39;ll see progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is helpful for others on the same journey and I appreciate any and all comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I already have some muscle in the before pic as I wasn't completely untrained at that point, but it's about 6 weeks after I started training again after I had my leg cast removed (ankle surgery). My story of starting out lifting is pretty similar to most guys, came out of a relationship, tall and super skinny guy who was underweight and I wanted to fix that. Bought a few dumbbells, started to toy around at home with bro splits. I gained a little bit of muscle but I tore the ligaments in my right ankle and required surgery. After the cast came off I had zero muscle left in my leg, and as I've had two ACL reconstructions and shoulder surgery after a torn labrum in the past I decided enough was enough, so I signed up to a gym and started doing the Reddit PPL. It kind of escalated from there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Workouts**

I ran the Reddit PPL for 6 months and saw a really good increase in muscle and strength. I have severe pectus for those who couldn't tell and my chest has always been a major weak point, both in size and strength. I really liked benching but 70kg was my absolute max and I wanted to improve that so I decided to go for a 5 day version of Nsuns with my accessory work focused on balanced hypertrophy. This was high volume and my body responded really well to it, I benched a 1RM of 90kg on NYE last year. I kept doing this and in april before gyms closed I did a really poor 160kg deadlift (no clue how I didn't injure myself) and a 62.5kg strict press.

While gyms were closed I did a 6 day per week home workout with a sloppy setup, some DBs and a pull up bar. I had occasional access to a gym to bench but my max dropped to 82.5kg and only my back saw a reasonable increase in size due to bb rows and weighted pull ups I could do at home. As soon as the gyms opened I went back to doing nSuns but injured my rotator cuff 3 weeks in. I decided powerlifting training wasn't worth it as my goal was a classic physique anyway, so I switched to a 6 day PPL I designed myself, I've since periodized that and still run that to this day. About 2 months ago I had a subluxation of my kneecap and I can no longer squat (I never really could anyway), so I changed my 2 leg days and I'm following Greg Nuckols 2 day intermediate deadlift right now because that's something I can do quite comfortably and I like doing it. Hope to hit the 200kg deadlift by the end of the year, not sure if possible but it's good to be ambitious.

**Nutrition**

My nutrition is relatively simple, I have and have had 0 issues maintaining strict discipline (be it nutrition or 6 day training regimes). The first lesson I learned is that I had to eat way, way, way more than I was doing. Right now after coming out of a cut (93kg -&gt; 87kg) I'm on 3850 kcal a day for a very slight surplus. I cycle a lot and I'm very tall, especially the latter seems to play a major part. I have 0 clue what BF% I am.

My macros are 90g fat, 270g protein and the rest carbs. A lot of veggies, dairy (I tolerate lactose super well) and high quality grains and rice make up the bulk of my diet. I very rarely have cheat meals. This won't work for most people but it is perfectly sustainable for me, I have been toying around with the macros a bit, at the end of the day the amount of calories is what's important.

**Lessons learned and future steps**

Things I've learned, might not necessarily be good advise for everybody.

* do what works for you, you have to enjoy it and be able to sustain it or it makes 0 sense. You want to train 2 days? Then train hard for 2 days, you're not doing this for a living
* form form form, learn to recognize injuries and learn how to prevent and treat them before they get too serious, get medical help if you're unsure
* find out what you respond well to, don't do things that hurt or simply don't seem to work. For aesthetics no 1 exercise is mandatory
* tailor generic programs to your needs, everybody needs different volumes and responds differently to certain impulses

For the future I'm going to slowly bulk up again trying to gain a little bit more strength. I'd like to experiment more with different bodybuilding style workouts and splits. I've been quite conservative and afraid to experiment and I'm definitely missing out here I think. I'm quite lean right now but I'd definitely like to fill out the front a bit more as it's not very impressive compared to my back (sorry don't have pictures of back).

Before we begin, [this is the article that contains ""Eating Through The Sticking Point"" by Matt Reynolds, where the pan of cake a day is discussed among other ideas](https://startingstrength.com/article/eating_through_the_sticking_points)

I've shared this article before, but felt like it deserved particular focus, especially in this holiday season while we are surrounded by good food and ample opportunities to enjoy it.  The notion of ""eating through the sticking points"" comes by way of Hugh Cassidy, an OG Powerlifter that boasts numerous accomplishments, to include winning the first World Championship of powerlifting against giants such as Jim Williams and John Kuc by way of pulling a 790lb deadlift along with an 800lb squat and a 570lb bench, all without powerlifting supportive equipment.  

Cassidy's idea was a simple and effective one: the weights you lift are proportional to your own bodyweight.  If your bodyweight goes UP, the proportion improves.  If you weigh 100lbs and try to bench 400lbs, it's a 4x bodyweight bench.  Bring your bodyweight up to 200 and it's 2x.  Bring it up to 300 and it's 1.5x.  Etc.  It was not uncommon for trainees under Cassidy to put on 3lbs in between workouts in order to come back and crush previous poundages.


[Bruce Randall](https://www.chaosandpain.com/tips/tips-anybody-can-get-lean-bulk-first-then-worry-about-your-abs-the-story-of-bruce-randall/) had similar observations as well, and utilized that approach to become a champion weightlifter AND THEN went on to become a champion bodybuilder.  As, once again, it proves true that fat is FAR easier to lose than muscle is to gain.

As we endeavor in our quest to gain muscle, remember these options afforded you.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve shared this article before, but felt like it deserved particular focus, especially in this holiday season while we are surrounded by good food and ample opportunities to enjoy it.  The notion of &amp;quot;eating through the sticking points&amp;quot; comes by way of Hugh Cassidy, an OG Powerlifter that boasts numerous accomplishments, to include winning the first World Championship of powerlifting against giants such as Jim Williams and John Kuc by way of pulling a 790lb deadlift along with an 800lb squat and a 570lb bench, all without powerlifting supportive equipment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassidy&amp;#39;s idea was a simple and effective one: the weights you lift are proportional to your own bodyweight.  If your bodyweight goes UP, the proportion improves.  If you weigh 100lbs and try to bench 400lbs, it&amp;#39;s a 4x bodyweight bench.  Bring your bodyweight up to 200 and it&amp;#39;s 2x.  Bring it up to 300 and it&amp;#39;s 1.5x.  Etc.  It was not uncommon for trainees under Cassidy to put on 3lbs in between workouts in order to come back and crush previous poundages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.chaosandpain.com/tips/tips-anybody-can-get-lean-bulk-first-then-worry-about-your-abs-the-story-of-bruce-randall/""&gt;Bruce Randall&lt;/a&gt; had similar observations as well, and utilized that approach to become a champion weightlifter AND THEN went on to become a champion bodybuilder.  As, once again, it proves true that fat is FAR easier to lose than muscle is to gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we endeavor in our quest to gain muscle, remember these options afforded you.  If things are stalling in the weight room, you can manipulate programming and do all sorts of tricks and hacks, but one of the first instincts as a gainer should be to eat through the sticking points.&lt;/p&gt;

,gainit,"Hey guys!

I’ve always been extremely underweight because I’ve struggled with eating food in general, because I saw it as more of a chore than anything else. I love to eat food that I love, but my mother would usually cook for me, and I’d just end up not finishing my food. The same applies for university, where I’d eat from the dining hall, but I would struggle to finish it, *for whatever reason.*

In any case, I was forced to sustain myself for a week—I bought myself my groceries and spices, and I essentially just planned through my entire week. Today was the first day that I actually cooked for myself, and for breakfast, I followed a very simple recipe online, but I put my own twist on it (because I prefer to use my own spice profile). After finishing cooking and I finally got to eat it... it was actually so delicious! I kept eating and eating, and I had to stop myself from eating any more. For dinner I freestyled a bit, but the same principle applied: I cooked for myself, I enjoyed it a lot, and I ate so much I had to stop myself. 

This seems obvious to say, but **enjoying your food** goes a long way in how much of it you’re willing to eat. If you don’t cook for yourself, you should learn! Nobody knows what you like to eat better than yourself. And if you do cook for yourself, but you find yourself struggling to motivate yourself to eat your food, perhaps try changing it up! Use different spices, change the way you cook, follow some recipes, take some classes, whatever helps you enjoy your food more! Eating 2500+ calories a day seemed insurmountable to me at first, but just eating today’s food made it seem incredibly easy. 

Clearly, this doesn’t apply to everyone, and this may seem very obvious to some of you guys, but I know that there are a couple of people who are slower on this than myself. So, I just wanted to share this piece of advice.

This is me [then](https://imgur.com/a/sDndF6N) (about two years ago) and [now](https://imgur.com/a/5Ke6NBI).

I still strive to be in the gym 4-5 days per week and it has become a passion of mine. It's stress relief, and time I put aside to do something for me and me alone. When I first started working out it wasn't my intention to be the biggest or the strongest, and it still isn't. I just wanted to look more ""normal"", but now I really enjoy the feeling of knowing I'm getting stronger and my hard work is paying off.

For workouts I still follow a push/pull/legs split. One thing I focus on much more now is spending time on compound movements, especially the big three. My squat has always been held back by mild congenital hip dysplasia so it's been a bit harder for me to grow my quads. My PRs aren't great, but its a huge accomplishment to me anyways, because I remember where I started. 2 years ago I could barely curl 10 lbs in one hand and couldn't bench the bar.

As far as diet, I pretty much eat healthy-ish, and focus on getting in good protein. Protein was the key for me to gaining and also to maintaining. I don't track calories or macros anymore. My weight has been very consistent for a while now, apart from minor fluctuations.

Overall I'm much more confident now than two years ago. I also feel healthier and better overall. I was always tired and low energy at 95 lbs. I remember it used to hurt to sit for too long because of my bones having no cushion, and my posture was terrible because those muscle groups were so underdeveloped. And I didn't have success immediately in the gym, I was very self conscious and insecure, due to lack of knowledge and experience on top of my scrawniness. But I just dove in head first and read as much as I could from places like this. I've learned a ton since then, and now I am confident enough to help friends who are wanting to start getting in the gym.

,gainit,"I need advice on my current fitness regime and how it can be improved! Sorry for the super long post but here we go! 

I started working out 8 years ago when I was 21 and put on muscle very quickly. I competed in two bodybuilding shows in 2014 &amp; 2015 in bikini. After both shows I rebounded and ended up gaining about 25lbs in about 2 months. Fortunately I continued lifting heavy and made serious gains during these rebounds. I bulked for about a year after my last show and then stayed in a maintenance phase until 2018, still lifting heavy. I looked very muscular for my size (5'1) and it was extremely noticeable that I worked out, even during ""bulking"". At my heaviest I was around 128lbs. 

In 2018 I started intermittent fasting to cut weight for an upcoming event. I had really great results and stayed in a deficit for a while. I cut down to about 112lbs and looked really great with all of that muscle. I have struggled in the I past with disordered eating and bullemia. I got extremely comfortable being lean and kept pushing myself more and more to lose more weight. I was still working out but eating very little and infrequently. Then in 2019 I started dealing with extreme anxiety and depression due to other factors, I stopped working out for almost an entire month and sometimes went a few days eating absolutely nothing. I had virtually no appetite and was constantly stressed. I didn't notice myself shrinking at first. Once I hit 102lbs I kinda just realized pretty much all of my muscle vanished. I'm ashamed I let it happen because I know better. I'm disappointed in myself and hate seeing myself in the mirror. 

So here we are now. I've slowly been adding in more calories since January 2020 and have worked my way up to 3000 cal/day. Right now I am around 126lbs. I've been lifting about 3-4 times/week. I try my best to go 4-5 days but I am in school and work full time so my time is very limited. I feel like I'm having issues gaining my muscle back - especially my GLUTES. I also started working at a more sedentary job in 2019 and I really started to notice lower back pain during my leg workouts. I now realize that from sitting all day I likely have glute amnesia. I now have a standing desk and stand most of my workday. I am working from home and doing school from home so unfortunately I don't get much daily activity. My metabolism seems to be on fire. Any day that I eat under 3000 cal I wake up feeling lean and deflated (which is not my goal right now). This has made gaining weight and muscle has been challenging. I'm putting on some muscle, but not as quickly as I did before. 

I am natural, no enhancement drugs or steroids. I smoke cannabis every night to stimulate my appetite. For supplements I take bcaas and protein powder. I'm trying to be more consistent with incorporating creatine but I've been forgetting often. I go to physiotherapy, chiropractor, and massage therapy all to help my lower back and glute issues. My workouts are a 5 day split with 3 leg days and 2 upper body days. I am still progressively overloading and adding weight every week. I do heavy compound lifts (225 sumo deadlift, 175 squat, &amp; 85 bench). I just feel like I was able to gain mass so much quicker when I was 21 vs 29 and its extremely depressing that I've set myself back so much. As I get older I also am way more prone to aches and pains which makes lifting a challenge at times. Also during quarantine I did my best to continue lifting heavy at home, but unfortunately my appetite vanished once again and I stopped eating as much as I had been. I've been consistent with my eating and lifting since July once gyms opened in my province. I still just feel like I'm so far behind what I was and I don't feel my gains are coming back.

,gainit,"I joined the gym in May 2017 and I recently found a picture of myself before going to the gym while scrolling through my phone. The difference between then and how I look currently is stark, and frankly surprised me. Thought y'all might enjoy.

[125 vs 160 lbs](https://imgur.com/a/TQlR37G) 

### Programs

I initially made my own linear progression, and did that for approximately 8 months maybe more? I dunno, in that range. I won't detail it because it was dumb. Don't do that. Follow literally any other linear progression and it will be better. I went from 125 - 150 lb, then back down to 138 lb during that time. After that I switched to u/utben free intermediate program for 3 rounds, all my lifts exploded and I went from 138 - 156 lb. (*People are asking for the program. To save you looking in the comments, you can find it here https://peakhd.net/p/free-intermediate-program). Amazing what intelligent programming can do. Then I did 1 round of Megazord by u/BeanchPauper, which took me into end of last year and up to 159 lb. 

I ignored conditioning during that time like a dummy, so I thought January would be good to get some of my base back and ran Tactical Barbell 2 base building, which has no heavy lifting in it whatsoever. Right at the end of that, lockdown happened, leaving me to my own devices and sitting at 155 lb. I made a 66 lb and 100 lb sandbag, did what I could with them for a month and a half, then ran a bastardized Deep Water beginner and Intermediate with them. I remained at 155 lb for the entirely of lock down. I didn't lift heavy from January until about September of this year as a result.

About a week or two after that I managed to piece enough of my home gym together to lift at home in Septemberish I believe and started the reddit novice program to get my feet wet again. I'm still running that and setting rep prs, which is both odd and fantastic to me. I am sitting at 160 lb currently.

### Lifts

All time tested: 345/210/435/135 in December 2019

Current:

Squat: 280 x 7

Bench: 195 x 7

Deadlift: 355 x 8

OHP: 110 x 7

### Diet

I eat consistently, and as a result, I don't count calories. When I want to increase weight I increase the size of individual meals by approximately 250 equivalent calories chunks and see if I'm budging the scale. So as an example, I might add a cup of rice to dinner or I may change my protein shake to having milk and peanut butter in it. When that stops working, I'll add to a different meal. Conversely, when I want to lose weight, I'll do the opposite. 

Typical current daily diet:

Breakfast 1: Beet smoothie (cup of frozen beets, cup of frozen mixed berries/pomegranate, fresh orange juice) + separate 2 scoop protein shake with 1 cup milk and 2 T peanut butter.

Breakfast 2: 4 boiled eggs

Lunch: 150g cold cut sandwich (mortadella, prosciutto, turkey breast, whatever) with greens, onions, tomatoes and mayo.

Dinner: 1/2 lb meat (all sorts of fatty meats), bunch of veggies, 2 cups rice. 

I haven't bothered to calculate how many calories this is, because I find it unnecessary to know. 

If anyone wants to know how I specifically worked up to eating this, ask me and I'd be happy to detail it.  

### Lessons

There's no fucking chance you could have told 125 lb me that I'd ever be this big. I absolutely would have not believed it and called you a liar. I honestly thought I didn't have the genetics to support that, my metabolism was way too high and that I was started at too old an age. All of that is clearly garbage, and if you find yourself thinking like that, stop. It doesn't even matter if it's true or not, because regardless, you can blast past those limitations with time, consistency and trying. Hell, I didn't even do shit correctly in the beginning, made up my own lp and it still worked out just fine.  

### Goals that I'm working towards:

I'd like to hit a 500 lb deadlift and suspect I'll have to get up to 175ish lb to do that. I'd also like to run a half marathon in 2 hours because fuck everyone who thinks I can't, and my athletic endeavors run mostly on spite damn it!",t2_9u830,False,,0,False,[Progress] M/36/5'4: 125 - 160 lb,[],r/gainit,False,6,,0,,False,t3_k3htho,False,dark,0.99,,public,424,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,424,,False,,1615161728.0,,[],{},,True,,1606714395.0,text,6,,,text,self.gainit,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I joined the gym in May 2017 and I recently found a picture of myself before going to the gym while scrolling through my phone. The difference between then and how I look currently is stark, and frankly surprised me. Thought y&amp;#39;all might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/TQlR37G""&gt;125 vs 160 lbs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Programs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially made my own linear progression, and did that for approximately 8 months maybe more? I dunno, in that range. I won&amp;#39;t detail it because it was dumb. Don&amp;#39;t do that. Follow literally any other linear progression and it will be better. I went from 125 - 150 lb, then back down to 138 lb during that time. After that I switched to &lt;a href=""/u/utben""&gt;u/utben&lt;/a&gt; free intermediate program for 3 rounds, all my lifts exploded and I went from 138 - 156 lb. (*People are asking for the program. To save you looking in the comments, you can find it here &lt;a href=""https://peakhd.net/p/free-intermediate-program""&gt;https://peakhd.net/p/free-intermediate-program&lt;/a&gt;). Amazing what intelligent programming can do. Then I did 1 round of Megazord by &lt;a href=""/u/BeanchPauper""&gt;u/BeanchPauper&lt;/a&gt;, which took me into end of last year and up to 159 lb. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ignored conditioning during that time like a dummy, so I thought January would be good to get some of my base back and ran Tactical Barbell 2 base building, which has no heavy lifting in it whatsoever. Right at the end of that, lockdown happened, leaving me to my own devices and sitting at 155 lb. I made a 66 lb and 100 lb sandbag, did what I could with them for a month and a half, then ran a bastardized Deep Water beginner and Intermediate with them. I remained at 155 lb for the entirely of lock down. I didn&amp;#39;t lift heavy from January until about September of this year as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a week or two after that I managed to piece enough of my home gym together to lift at home in Septemberish I believe and started the reddit novice program to get my feet wet again. I&amp;#39;m still running that and setting rep prs, which is both odd and fantastic to me. I am sitting at 160 lb currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lifts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All time tested: 345/210/435/135 in December 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squat: 280 x 7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bench: 195 x 7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadlift: 355 x 8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OHP: 110 x 7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Diet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat consistently, and as a result, I don&amp;#39;t count calories. When I want to increase weight I increase the size of individual meals by approximately 250 equivalent calories chunks and see if I&amp;#39;m budging the scale.

,gainit,"Hey I wanted to share three mistakes I made in my first 2 years of lifting and how I stayed at a pretty beginner level the whole time as a result of it. This is just personal so I have 0 clue if it will work but if your training isn't going where you want it try it out. 

1) I tried training 5-6 days a week, 

as a result of having this goal I usually only made it to 4 days and would beat myself up over missing that 5th day and anytime I did lift 5 days a week I would be wiped the next week and feel terrible missing more workouts and feeling worse about it. I switched to working out 4 days a week and it keeps the gym fresh and fun and keeps me super motivated to push myself to the limit every time I'm there which I think is key as I got complacent after feeling like I'm always in the gym.


2)  I chose weight as the first way to add resistance, 

Personally, this has caused 99.99% of all injuries I have occurred and I think so many lifters are guilty of this. The thing is I didn't even feel like I was ego lifting but rather as soon as I would crank out 8 reps at X weight id automatically increase maybe 5-10 pounds. Personally, this caused a lot of weight on my joints despite having reviewed and videotaped my form it just felt like it took a toll on me and as a guy in my early 20's that's a scare. 

Instead I really ""mastered"" each rep and I know it sounds cheesy but I do 5 sets of 12-15 strict reps with an extremely slow decline and you'll be able to lift 1/2 of the weight you used to and will feel like it took 120% of the effort you used to use to lift the old heavier weight. This has caused my gains to explode over a short 8 month period when compared to about 2 years of lifting the older way. In addition to this I added weighted calisthenics to this and you'll die trying to do 5X15 weighted pull-ups and dips esp if you go so slow on the decline. 

Also on the injury's side, all my nagging pains have gone away even on my problem exercises (now I also do physio and stretch a lot this new style has just not regressed my injuries its not fixing them actively I am).



3) I didn't address my injuries and take the time I needed off and worked too many front exercises

If your shoulder is nagging you then stop working out your shoulder replace it with cardio in your workouts or whatever you want. The point is immediately stop and start rehabbing and stretching the muscle and come back and start resistance bands if you can do those for a week or 2 start back in SLOWLY on the exercises I usually do 1/2 the weight and 1/2 the reps just to get the blood in there the goal is just to rehab without snapping something and having to take 8-16 months off vs 1. Lastly I worked so many chest exercises and front delts and realized I'm completely neglecting my back and it caused SO MANY muscular imbalances and injures and was a big hole in my physique too hit your rows like crazy and those rear delts I like to do 2 pulls for every push movement.



Again these were my thoughts I figured it might be good to consider lmk

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my friends complimented me on the size of my arms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week I ripped my favorite pair of shorts -- it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,gainit,"Hey r/gainit

I (22M) have recently decided that I want to start back up with the gym and try to build my muscle mass up some (the whole global pandemic thing kind of put it on the back burner for me for a little while). I've always considered myself a skinny guy, and before the world went crazy this year I was fairly active (college student, walking 5-8 miles every day and working out 4-5x days per week) when it came to putting on weight. I didn't have much of a plan or super strict diet at the time, but managed to go from 125 to 140 before the lockdown hit (I'm 5'8"" for reference).

However, between being at home and not living the same lifestyle that I was back on campus, I've put on a fair amount of weight, and not the good kind. I'm up to just under 160lbs, which would be great if it were lean muscle, but its definitely mostly fat as a result of my more sedentary lifestyle. The body fat calculators that I've looked at have clocked me in at a little under 20%, which is far from where I want to be. I've been incorporating more cardio into my day-to-day routines to trim this down some, and have been trying to eat healthier food and less calories, but considering I'm hoping to get back in the gym anyway, I'm wondering if I should seek to lose some of this body fat before I start trying to put on muscle mass, or if I should just go for it anyway and hope it gets evened out as I try to focus more on building muscle. I'm new to the more technical aspects of dieting and exercise planning, so I'm just trying to figure out the best way to approach this.

Before pic is from about 5 years ago, I couldn't find one from 3 years ago but I weighed about the same at that time. After pic is just a couple of days ago. Was a difficult journey gaining size. Still want to get to 170 lbs but it's proven difficult to add any more weight now.
