### Overview  

The ACT and SAT are well-known standardized tests and are used for college admissions decisions and awarding merit-based scholarships.  
  
This project aims to analyse ACT and SAT datasets from 2017 and 2018 in hopes of identifying investment opportunities for the College Board to improve participation rates for SAT. Analysis include data cleansing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualizations, descriptive and inferencial statistics, some outside research and ultimately my recommendations for the College Board.

### Conclusions and recommendation  
  
My recommendation is for College Board to focus their investments for Iowa for 2 main reasons:  
  
1. Iowa currently does not enforce SAT nor ACT tests for students  
2. Iowa currently only have a 2-3% participation rate for SAT currently  
  
Recommended steps to take include:  
  
1. Require Iowa students to take SAT test  
2. Waive off fees for students (at least for those in public schools)
